</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This series of Amendments deals with the question of aldermen in London. The purpose is to abolish the office of alderman in Greater London after the next election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am puzzled, as was the Under-Secretary on a previous Amendment, about the philosophy behind the alderman as a person. Is he a mystical being with tremendous authority and knowledge, who should be exempt from the more menial and mundane exercises in which we, as Members of Parliament, have to indulge? Is he someone who should be above such terrible things as elections? Is he a person whose knowledge is so great that the community cannot do without him?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not going back to their earliest history when they were the elders of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1118</span>
community, but the philosophy behind the office of alderman in recent years has been based on the idea that one wanted somebody who was independent, to come in with his knowledge and wisdom and keep everybody else informed and possibly even in order. This philosophy has become hopelessly out of date. We have seen the emergence of party politics in local government as in central government. We have seen the opportunity given to people democratically to make their choice. Any idea that aldermen were appointed because they were independent has long since gone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an ancient Saxon blood sport known as fiddling the aldermanic vacancies. This blood sport is something about which no one on either side of the Committee can be totally blameless. Both major parties have done it, and the Liberals also did it in their time. This is far removed from the idea of the mystical, independent, non-party spirit, which guided the workings of the council. It has something to do with preserving power; it has nothing whatever to do with democracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the second reason for moving the Amendment and why it is on all fours with the rejection of the previous Amendment, when the hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Maddan) staged a gallant rearguard action in favour of preserving an emasculated system of aldermen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third basis is the general philosophy of what local government is all about. If, as we agree, local government is, or ought to be, local democracy, we have not only the testimony of my hon. Friends who made such very good speeches on the point in the earlier Amendments; we have the testimony of the Under-Secretary of State and of the hon. Lady the Member for Merton and Morden (Miss Fookes), both of whom made the point absolutely clearly. Truthfully, there is no reason why anyone who wishes to serve in local government should not stand for election; it is as simple as that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the general philosophy. Then why do we choose London for a specific series of Amendments rather than putting it together with the previous Amendments? When I say "we" I am perhaps usurping your authority, Sir Stephen, but I know you will forgive me. The answer is that, while London is obviously an area
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0609">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1119</span>
of local government as other areas are throughout the country, it is rather a distinctive one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, it was in its day the youngest county in the country and it will now emerge as the oldest metropolitan county in the country. One appreciates that, because of the way that London government has grown up and the fact that the last Act dealing with London government was a matter of nine years ago, it will not be totally assimilated to the rest of the country, or certainly not yet, and I am not at the moment arguing the case that it should be. This is something which requires some consideration, but it is not the subject of the Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is true, however, is that whether there should be differences in electoral terms, or in powers and so on, between Greater London and the rest of the country, there should certainly be no difference in the expression of democratic government; indeed, on the basis of "all rowed fast but none so fast as stroke", I should have expected London to be rather ahead of the rest of the community. I say this with due deference to my Welsh friends and to everyone else in the Committee. I appreciate that the hon. Lady and I are are in an uncomfortable minority on this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are, however, proud of London's system of government and we regard it as somewhat distinctive. For this reason, whatever had been the result of the previous Amendments dealing with the country as a whole, I certainly should have been willing and anxious to move this series of Amendments and I should have hoped to have the hon. Lady's support in that event too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Summing it up very briefly, I hope that all of us will appreciate that, as the Committee has overwhelmingly decided that it wants a democratic system of local government, that it wants to say goodbye to aldermen in England and Wales, it should not face itself with the absurd anomaly of continuing aldermen in Greater London. This would be totally wrong and the effect in London of abolishing aldermen, while one must not overestimate it, will have some bearing on the percentage of the electorate who will vote in forthcoming London elections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have talked about our being proud
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1120</span>
of London government. As a Londoner, I can justifiably say that, but we are not terribly proud of the number of people who vote in our local government elections. Sometimes, indeed, it is rather misleading because one tends to draw conclusions from the small number who vote in a London election and assume that that must be true all over the country, and one comes up with some surprises. By and large, however, anything which makes the government of London more democratic must be something which the Committee as a whole would welcome and appreciate. It is in that spirit that I am moving the Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Michael Heseltine)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the remarks of the right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) in that he has drawn the attention of the Committee to what is undoubtedly true—that, on the question of democratic representation, there is a very wide measure of agreement on both sides of the Committee. I do not need to remind the Committee of the Amendment which we felt able to accept from the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes), a token, I think, of our virtual unanimity on this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is a simple one as to whether or not on a major issue of this kind we should extend the scope of the Bill to the reorganisation of London. We certainly looked at the matter, as did the previous Government when they were considering the reorganisation of local government. The Committee will be aware that in 1963 a very detailed reconsideration of London's local government was undertaken and a Bill passed by the House which substantially changed the procedures within the London area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The view of the previous Government—and we believe it was right—was that for a number of reasons it would be wrong now to extend the scope of this Bill to change a part of the London government system. I quote from the last Government's White Paper which dealt with this, Cmnd. 4276 published in February, 1970:
	<br><blockquote><p>"While some of the Commission's proposals (for example, on matters affecting the election and constitution of local authorities) have general implications, the Government are not proposing to alter the structure of the London authorities or the distribution of functions between them."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0610">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1121</span>
It is, therefore, an important point to plead at the beginning of my remarks that although one may be willing to accept the principle, as I think we have all indicated, the detail of this subject cannot be divorced from a number of other immediately consequential matters which would, in fact, extend the scope of the Bill to London. Both Governments, having looked at the detail, have decided that that would not be practicable in the circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that a number of aspects of the Bill extend to the London area, but there is nothing which affects the constitution of the London authorities or the distribution of functions between them. Those are the two areas which both Governments have decided not to incorporate in the reorganisation of local government outside London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that hon. Members opposite ought to be prepared to accept the logic of what they themselves decided—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denis Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We did not decide any such thing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—when they were in office. When they looked at the details, their own White Paper clearly indicated that they would not deal with London in the way which they now suggest in the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned the fact that a number of related issues would immediately come up for consideration if this principle were accepted. The size of the councils would automatically be reduced by approximately one-seventh. There are also differences in the electoral arrangements for the councils. For example, they do not have four-yearly elections as we now propose for the rest of the country. Re-warding would be necessary to cope with the adjustments in size.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to us that the whole question of the electoral arrangements which would need to be considered in London should be a matter open to any future Government. I in no way wish to close the door to the principle which we are discussing. We have indicated clearly what are our views in relation to the rest of the country. Some subsequent occasion when the local government structure of London is being considered would be the appropriate time to deal with the electoral arrangements, arrangements for warding, the election of aldermen, if anyone wished to consider
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1122</span>
that, and so on. The matter could be considered in a Bill of its own on some subsequent occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is certainly our view—and I believe that it was the view of the last Government—that we are undertaking a massive reorganisation already; we have gone through a very wide range of consultative processes with regard to the Bill; and at this stage it would be wrong to move away from the principle we have accepted, which is that we shall not tinker with the constitution or the distribution of functions within the London area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Roper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that my right hon. Friend the Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) was able to move the Amendment. We have the support of the two Members of the Committee from the Greater London area. Earlier I felt that my hon. Friend the Member for Llanelly (Mr. Denzil Davies) and I were perhaps in a similar position when we trespassed into Wiltshire and that we might find difficulty in raising the subject of Greater London in the Committee. At least on this occasion I was heartened to receive a letter from the London Boroughs Association to say that they were fully in support of the Amendment standing at that time in the names of my hon. Friend the Member for Llanelly and myself, and which now has the support of my right hon. and hon. Friends. Since the London boroughs would like to see this change, the Government should reconsider the views put forward by the Under-Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is right for the rest of the country should now be extended to London. There is no case for continuing the undemocratic principle of aldermanic seats which we have agreed, almost unanimously, should be removed elsewhere. When the hon. Lady the Member for Merton and Morden (Miss Fookes) spoke last week she made her views quite clear. She said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I do not wish under any circumstances, to retain aldermen. Perhaps it is because I have known a good many aldermen…."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee D,</i> 27th January, 1971; 	<i>c.</i> 1054.]</p></blockquote>
I am not quite sure whether those were Greater London or London borough aldermen, but I assume that they were aldermen within the Greater London area. There is no special quality of Lon-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0611">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1123</span>
don aldermen to suggest that they should be preserved while aldermen in the rest of the country should be removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The suggestion of the Under-Secretary that this could have been dealt with in the 1963 Act is not altogether reasonable. At the time of the 1963 Act the rest of the country still had an aldermanic system. To take special measures to affect London at that time would have been just as unfair as for London to maintain aldermen now. Now that aldermen are being changed elsewhere, I believe that they should be removed from London also.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary said that there would have to be changes in the composition of the councils because there would be a reduction of one-seventh and that this would lead to re-warding. Could he explain to the Committee why this would happen. It does not seem to me that the reduction of one-seventh, one-sixth of the council made up of aldermen, would require any particular re-warding. The elected members will remain exactly the same, and could be elected by the same wards as at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the argument of continuity that might be developed, the fact that there is a total change of the council in Greater London boroughs and the Greater London council, this applies to the county councils in the rest of the country also. Admittedly, the district councils do have elections where part of the membership changes each year. The Bill contains in this Schedule Clauses dealing with the composition of the Greater London Council and of the councils of London boroughs. We on this side of the Committee are not trying to introduce a new Clause or a new Schedule. We are not raising the principle anew; we are trying to ensure that in this Schedule of the Bill, dealing already with the composition of councils in Greater London and the London boroughs, the same practice should apply as applies in the rest of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, in spite of the remarks just now from the Under-Secretary, the Government will think about this again and, even if they cannot give us too encouraging an answer today, will agree at least that there should be further consultations, and that we can come back to it on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1124</span>
declare an interest as an alderman of the Borough of Deptford in which I was born and brought up, but that makes me in no way an advocate of the retention of the office of alderman throughout England and Wales. As the Under-Secretary has said, we are not engaged in these proceedings in the reform of government in the area of the Greater London Council. We should need to look at that with the similar care taken in the rest of the country if we were to think in terms of making alterations under this Bill for the Greater London area. I understand that the Greater London Council has difficulty in manning its various committees with its existing membership of 100 councillors and 60 aldermen. The effect of the coming into force of an anticipated Order making the Greater London election boundaries coterminous with those for parliamentary constituencies will be to reduce, as in 1973, the numbers of councillors and aldermen to, respectively, 92 and 15. This will present the Greater London Council with increased problems of manning its committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both sides of this Committee will recognise the value of some, at any rate, of the aldermanic appointments made to the Greater London Council in recent years—people with particular expertise brought on by those serving both the main political parties, able men and women.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quite accept that there are aldermen who are very fine, civic-minded people, but why on earth cannot they contest elections like the rest of us?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman ought not to interrupt my point. I am not saying that the alderman should stand for election; that is not part of my case. I agree that in England and Wales as a whole we should see the end of the aldermanic system. I prefaced my remarks with my agreement to the proposal in that respect. I am talking particularly of the position in London; certainly in the size of the Council—surely the right hon. Gentleman will allow that this was the point I was making—there is a manning problem. It is presumably a help to have people with particular expertise, and both main political parties have brought in people with the type of qualifications needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0612">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1125</span>
We shall, when we come to Clause 50, be determining when a reorganisation of local administration in the Greater London area shall be looked at—a revision of boundaries, if required, within certain period dates—and surely that will provide the opportunity for looking at the question with the degree of care and consideration necessary for making fundamental changes. It is on that basis that I would agree with those who are prepared to resist the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot understand for a moment how anyone can even think of allowing this situation to continue in Greater London. The principle is a very important matter to debate. Either it is valid and upheld and supported, or else someone looks for reasons for breaching it at some point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I examined this Bill with some interest, and in Schedule 2, paragraph 6, on page 196, it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The aldermen of the Greater London Council and of a London borough shall be elected by the Council from among the councillors …".</p></blockquote>
Then it adds quite rightly, because the normal practice is often adopted to confuse the electorate:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… or persons qualified to be councillors."</p></blockquote>
Very often it is not even that, because people are put on to the aldermanic benches who have been disqualified in an election; then, in order to sustain a majority situation, they are brought back on to the council in the role of alderman. The likelihood of the best people getting there is very much in doubt. Indeed, if a survey of aldermen were taken throughout the kingdom, one would find a very high proportion of people who have been placed there, in very much the same way as in this House when we have finished with hon. Members we put them in another place. Aldermen are not a useful addition to councils in that sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This destroys something very valuable in local government, and the first thing it destroys is the very good alderman's reputation, the alderman who could by virtue of an election serve on the council because of his own personality, because of his knowledge of local government. The reputation of the aldermanic system has been destroyed in later years and with it the effectiveness of the good alderman, due to councils bringing in people who have been disqualified in elections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1126</span>
The system has been diluted to such a point that we have agreed for this reason and many others that aldermen shall not be part of the local government system in this kingdom outside the Greater London area, so far as hon. Members opposite are concerned, but, so far as we on this side of the Committee appear to be concerned, the whole principle should apply to Greater London as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought that anyone who wants to serve local government need not depend upon his councillor colleagues to get a position in which he can apply his knowledge for the good of the people he represents. He can serve local government by the normal processes adopted by anyone seeking membership of a council. The Government should not call upon what was in a White Paper some time ago, as I think the Under-Secretary did. A White Paper is produced for the purposes of this House to examine the proposals that the Government of the day have in mind, but with the understanding that it will be amended. From time to time the Minister and the Under-Secretary have called upon the previous Government's White Paper on the Maud Report to support their weaker case in their present proposals in this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those of us on this side of the Committee would, in the event of the Maud Report coming to us in the form of a Bill—in fact, there was no Bill—have felt just as strongly about aldermen. Many of us have felt for years that the bold idea of having some kind of continuity in local government through the processes of the aldermanic bench has long been discounted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary could well have produced some other information to help us to consider more carefully the rigid position he has taken up. For instance, he said there were a number of reasons not to pursue this principle in the case of Greater London, but I did not hear very many reasons. He said that if we adopted the idea, it would reduce the membership of the councils by one-seventh. I should like more information about how he arrives at that conclusion. If this is the end product of the principle being applied, the question to ask is this: is it harmful? It is not a good argument to say that there should be a reduction in the councils. We want to know the effect of that conclusion. How will the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0613">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1127</span>
reduction of the aldermanic membership of a council affect its function? If it is argued that the functions of councils outside of Greater London are enhanced and applied more efficiently with the absence of aldermen, how do we arrive at the conclusion that the inclusion of aldermen in Greater London does not produce that situation, but is an improved situation on the policy applied to the rest of the country?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary has not given the Committee many reasons. If there is an alderman, a good man or woman, as well as a poor alderman, out of contact with the electorate in the form of electioneering, in office for six years, this in itself is hardly good for local government. I have found that the challenge of an election in a democracy brings a man down to earth and causes him to reconsider many of his ideas; but moreover, it brings him more in line with changing public thinking. He does not become an appendage to the process. When he fights an election he becomes absorbed with public opinion and, if he is intelligent, he seeks not only to respond to it, but also to use it to give a lead and give that opinion momentum and effectiveness in the elected councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Greater London where hon. Members on both sides have direct experience in addition to experience as public representatives, they have asserted that they are quite confident that the aldermanic situation should go. I should have thought that they would not say that lightly or for the purposes of making a party political point. In making that point, I should have thought that they would have produced from the Under-Secretary some deeper thinking about his response. Before we can let this pass, perhaps he will reconsider the need to tell the Committee the extent of his thinking on this matter, or whether he has merely adopted a preconceived notion that to take the Greater London problem in hand would add to the further discussions invited by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the time-table pressing upon him? Does he not want to pursue this, not because the principle is wrong, but because it is inconvenient?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1128</span>
hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will not take it amiss if I say that I am not wholly convinced by his arguments. The principle of abolishing aldermen has already been thoroughly discussed and agreed upon by all sides, so there is no question of the principle. It therefore seems to be a matter of practicalities, what a previous Prime Minister might have called "little local difficulties".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Far from being an argument for not altering the system now, the massive reorganisation being undertaken is the very moment to do so. This is the time when both the Civil Service and the Committee have their minds bent on this, and I do not know when the occasion will arise again. The major landmarks seem to have been in 1888, 1933, 1963 and now 1972. If the precedents are anything to go by, the time lag will be a very long one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I am a little more sensitive about this because, having on one rash occasion tried to teach children the intricacies of local government as it then was, I know that one always comes up against the blunt question "Why?" when children are presented with something illogical. This seems to me wholly illogical if we do nothing about it at this time.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Fookes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not altogether share my hon. Friend's enthusiasm. To return to the point, if the Government are in difficulties about these practicalities, could they not go half way to meet the point by building into the Bill some arrangement for changing it within a certain period of time? This would seem to me to give us some opportunity to decide the ways and means. I feel that the vague indication that a future Government might wish to tackle this is not good enough. Could I please ask my hon. Friends to think again?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The speech of the hon. Lady was in marked contrast to that of the Minister. It was a speech of great clarity and force, and was based on the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0614">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1129</span>
logic of the Government's own policy in the decisions which the Committee has previously taken. If I may say so to the Minister, his speech was unmitigated rubbish. I have seldom heard such an indefensible set of proposals put forward with such a lack of enthusiasm as we heard from the Minister. He knows that his proposition cannot be defended. He tells us that this is not the place to extend the scope of the Bill. I almost interjected, on a point of order, Sir Stephen, to ask whether you could confirm to the Committee that Schedule 2 was part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule 2 deals entirely with the constitution and membership of the Greater London Council and the London boroughs. As one of my hon. Friends has already pointed out, it has two paragraphs—paragraphs 6 and 7—which deal exclusively with aldermen and election of aldermen. If this is not the moment for us to consider whether what we are enacting in legislation is right, or is inaccurate, or ought to be pursued or to be approved in principle, then I do not know what on earth the Committee is doing in deliberating about the question at all. Of course, this is the moment. This is the moment when we decide whether we shall continue with aldermen in London or whether we will face up to the logic as we have in the rest of the country and abolish them. As the hon. Lady pointed out, if we let this moment go, if this horse slips out of the stable, how many years will it be before we catch it again?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was very interested in the speech of the hon. Member for Northants, South (Mr. Arthur Jones) because it reflected the unspoken prejudices which are causing the Government to seek to reject the Amendment—the prejudices of all their friends in London who want to serve with the distinguished title of alderman on the Greater London Council but do not want the inconvenience of democracy. Democracy is a very inconvenient thing for some people. No doubt you, Sir Stephen, like the rest of us, would be delighted if we could manage to serve on authorities or in Parliament without having to run the gauntlet of public opinion, which is the great safeguard. I am not impressed by the argument that in London it has brought on to the council people who would not otherwise have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1130</span>
been there. That is precisely the objection to the system. This is the way in which it has been abused in London. It has brought on distinguished people but people who in no way consider themselves accountable to the electorate as a whole, which is what democracy is all about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could not understand why the Minister rested his case so often—at least four times, I think he told us—on the fact that the previous Government took the same view as he did. I do not believe that for one moment. The previous Government, and the Labour Party as a whole, made a very firm commitment for the abolition of aldermen on the grounds of elementary democratic practice. It was always their intention that aldermen should be abolished throughout the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must not keep holding up his White Paper—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Your White Paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—or, worse still, our White Paper. The Government themselves, in the Bill, do not regard White Papers as sacrosanct or as a last word. The whole Bill is a departure from what was said in the Government White Paper. The White Paper is an indication of Government thinking upon a matter—not the last word. The Labour Party, as a matter of policy, has come out against the retention of the aldermanic system on the grounds that it cannot be defended in democratic terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the four objections of the Minister. The situation becomes even more ridiculous. First, the Minister tells us that if we end the aldermanic system in London it will reduce the size of the council. That is what we have just decided to do in respect of every other council in the country. We have just decided to reduce by one-quarter the size of the councils of Manchester, Liverpool, Sheffield, Nottingham and Birmingham. We have eliminated the aldermen and there will just be councillors. No one is suggesting that the size of those councils should be made up by electing four councillors instead of three. So there is nothing in the argument that bears examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second, the Minister talks about the principle of four-year elections. He says that four-year elections, in terms of local
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0615">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1131</span>
authorities, is something we should take into account in terms of London. So far as the Greater London Council is concerned, it does not have annual elections now. The Greater London Council is not on all fours with other major councils in the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nor is it true to suggest that this would necessitate the complete re-warding of the boroughs in London. If it is necessary to re-ward them, why do we not do it? There is no reason why, in accepting the Amendment, the Government could not come forward with consequential further Amenments to increase the size of councils. We do not happen to think it necessary, but if the Government think that in London there is so much work to do that more councillors are needed, then we should have to face up to the proposition that there should be a degree of re-warding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have made out no case at all for this procrastination. They are now in quite a ridiculous position. When the world outside looks at our local government system, if the Bill is passed, what will be made of it? It will be seen that throughout the country people will be properly and democratically re-elected to serve on local bodies except in London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is unique about London to make us retain these aldermen? One suspects that there has been pressure, probably emanating from the City of London—another anachronism in local government terms in this day and age—and that many people who support the Conservative Party and have influence beyond that which they ought to have, have said that they do not want the dignified style and title of alderman to disappear but want to continue to serve on the aldermanic bench and to do so without having to be submitted to the electorate or to be involved in all the paraphernalia of elections which we all know are great inconveniences. It is the price of democracy that there is an inconvenience, that people have to stand for election, and have to be answerable to the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having accepted the logic of that situation for the rest of the country, it is totally indefensible for the Government to resist it here. I therefore hope that they will think again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the tell-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1132</span>
ing arguments which have been made in favour of the Amendment and against what the Under-Secretary has said. However, I think that they deserve reiteration in view of the irrational and inconclusive explanations which have been given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend has just said, one wonders why the Government are resisting the Amendment. Now that the Committee has decided that in general throughout England and Wales aldermen should no longer exist, the Amendment in fact seeks to remove an anomaly in our legislation. We are not proposing an innovation or a substantial change in the law. We are proposing to remove an anomaly. I should have thought that our function as parliamentarians was to try to ensure that our legislation was as coherent and as logical as possible. Now is the time to put this right and to make the legislation as logical as possible. Obviously, one cannot always be entirely logical in every respect, but here the opportunity exists. The Under-Secretary's explanation does not hold water at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, I should like to reiterate what my hon. Friend has said. One wonders what the pressures upon the Government to resist the Amendment have been. Is it that business and financial interests in London feel that it is possibly of value to them to sit on councils as aldermen without subjecting themselves to the will of the electorate? Possibly if the Amendment were carried, the anomaly of the City of London would stick out even further and the pressure for the removal of aldermen in that area would become irresistible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary should tell us the real reason why he is resisting the Amendment. It cannot possibly be the reason he has given. He says that this is not the place to accept the Amendment. He says that we should wait for future legislation. With great respect, this is the place. If not, why has Schedule 2 been included in this Bill? What is the purpose of Schedule 2? Schedule 2 is entitled:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Constitution and Membership of Greater London Council and London Borough Councils".</p></blockquote>
What is that about, if not the composition of London councils? The Amendment is directly related to that fact. The Schedule further deals with:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0616">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1133</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Chairman and mayor …</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Election of chairman and mayor …</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Power of mayor …</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Aldermen …</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Election of aldermen …</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Term of office …</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Electoral divisions and wards".</p></blockquote>
It is directly related only to the Greater London Council and the London borough council areas and to nothing else at all in the rest of England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary owes it to the Committee to give us a defensible explanation of why he is resisting logic and why the Government are so concerned to perpetuate what would clearly be an anomaly if the Bill becomes law and the Amendment is defeated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas Swain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question which comes to my mind is this. Why is there a difference between the Metropolitan County of South Yorkshire and Greater London in the question of aldermen or no aldermen? I was a member of a local authority for 23 years and a member of the Derbyshire County Council for nine years. In all that time I fought what was perhaps a lone battle at times to get away from the system of aldermen. I shall give two examples to illustrate why.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the County of Derbyshire in 1968 when the Conservatives took control, because of the narrowness of the majority they elected as an alderman a man who had never fought a local government seat in his life but had been ignominiously defeated in two consecutive parliamentary elections. Thus in two different constituencies the people of Derbyshire had had the opportunity to elect that individual if they had so desired. On another occasion, two individuals who again had suffered ignominious defeats in the County Council elections were elected as aldermen. The alderman who had never served on a local authority and never fought a local authority election, was given the prime responsibility by the county council of drawing up the map and lines for new local government districts in the county.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point is that aldermen, in London as anywhere else, hold very responsible chairmanships of high-spending and important committees. I believe that no person should be responsible to a committee as its chairman unless he has gone through the processes of democratic election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1134</span>
I do not ask the Minister to look again and come back with some more suggestions; I ask him to say this morning that he will omit this section of Schedule 2 and start afresh. I was given to understand a long time ago that local government needed reforming. There were outstanding certain anomalies of great importance, one of which was that the number of aldermen selected by a party with a very narrow majority could consolidate that party for the next three or four years, as the case might be. They could then bulldoze their policies through the committees on the strength of a non-elected representation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I differ from my hon. Friend the Member for The Hartlepools (Mr. Leadbitter) on the question of his analogy with the second chamber in the Houses of Parliament. The second chamber is admittedly a non-elected body, but at no time do the votes in the second chamber count against the minority party or majority party, or for the majority party in the House of Commons. The analogy is not in strict accordance with the system as we know it today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend on the point he is developing. I was seeking, in drawing this analogy, to go no further than the point that it was in many cases an undemocratic process so far as the alderman was concerned, and in other cases a place where one put one's friends after getting tired of them in a particular area. There are cases in this country where councils have been preserved in control of a particular party by feeding into the aldermanic bench people who are not necessarily efficient or useful except for their heads and their hands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Might I suggest to the Committee and to the hon. Member that we should not pursue these analogies about the other chamber too far in this Committee. There are plenty of examples within the local government field without going into other parliamentary fields.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I only did that, Sir Stephen, with all due apologies to you, as my hon. Friend raised the point and you did not draw him to order. I thought I would answer his analogy, strictly in accordance with the fairness with which he presented it to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0617">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1135</span>
We have set up this Committee, and the Conservative Government, in their wisdom or otherwise, have decided to reform local government. We decided, as a party, to reform local government by setting up the Redcliffe-Maud Commission, and the Redcliffe-Maud Commission reported. Consequently the Conservative Government completely disregarded the Redcliffe-Maud Commission and set up their own guide-lines for reform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the major anomalies is that there are comparisons in the structure, functions, powers and set-up of metropolitan counties outside London. They will be refused, and quite rightly, the power to elect aldermen from either their own numbers or outside. For instance, in the Borough of Chesterfield, which is exactly equal in numbers on the council, they used the casting vote of the mayor and swept all the Labour aldermen out, and filled the seats up to get their policies through, although the electorate had decided that there were exactly the same number of Tories as Labour men elected by the democratic process. This is a perfect illustration of where the aldermanic system has been used to advantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not claim to be lily white on this. In 1946 when we took over as the controlling party in Derbyshire County Council I was the person who moved that every member of the Tory Party who held an aldermanic seat be sacked, and I would do it again in the aldermanic system. But what I did was not right. I did it for party advantage, and I am honest enough to say this. I want the Minister to change the system to prevent such people as myself or the Conservative Party from exploiting the position. It would not be possible to exploit the position if the system did not allow one to do it. Why should the system in London be any different from the system anywhere else? It is only due to the pressures of the City of London and the pressures of the supporters of the Conservative Party who have no more interest in local government—apart from a vested interest to say the least, and a personal interest to say the worst—than to become aldermen on this authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to look seriously at this anomaly, because the people in the South Yorkshire metropolitan district will
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1136</span>
not be very happy if they are operating strictly within the scheme of local government as set up by this Government but with totally different concepts of election of non-elected representatives. I hope that the non-elected representatives will be cleared out for ever more. If democracy is to work in this country, we have to see to it within the system, and we have a golden opportunity in this Committee this morning to see that neither of the two major political parties or, in some instances, the Liberal party can, by manoeuvring the system of aldermanic seats, gain and retain, above all things, a majority. I hope that the Minister looks at this matter in this light.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to reconstruct local government it has to be reconstructed on a fair play basis. I am convinced that by leaving aldermen in the city and in the boroughs in London is not fair, it is not equitable, and it is not democratic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brynmor John</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I listened to the limp explanation of the Under-Secretary I reflected that in him inertia has been elevated to a way of life. He must realise that there is never a right time for many people for amending principles. It is not good enough, on a major upheaval in local government, to say that this is not the right time—"If only you had caught me five minutes later it would have been all right". If we were to remind the Under-Secretary in a year's time "You told us on the Local Government Bill that then was not the right time; now do something about local government", he would say "We have just gone through this major upheaval in local government, and now would not be the time to have further disturbances." So it would go on into infinity with the Under-Secretary protesting that "now" was not the right time, but that some vague future time might be correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that this is the correct time. It is interesting to observe that Ministers have not always taken this view. For example, just in advance of a major local government reorganisation they did not hesitate to put on the Statute Book the Local Government (Qualification of Councillors) Act, whose sole purpose was to give people who were not otherwise qualified to stand as councillors in the area, who merely owned or occupied property in those areas, the right to stand at a subsequent election just in time for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0618">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1137</span>
May, 1970. They did not hesitate to introduce that partial measure, notwithstanding the fact that, soon after, they were to introduce this major upheaval in local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Richard Sharples)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will know that it was to reverse a partial decision taken by the previous Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the logic of the hon. Gentleman's Government were to be followed through, he would have reserved that position for a major upheaval. He would not have partially reversed this. The hon. Gentleman is entitled to defend—as he and his hon. Friend tried to do so often during the proceedings of that Committee—the proposition that a man can stand as a councillor who does not live in the locality but merely occupies or owns property in it. What I am saying is that we are consistent in saying that the country deserves a quality of treatment in respect of aldermen, just as the previous Act was consistent in saying that the country should be treated equally and that only people living in those local government areas should be allowed to stand as councillors in that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Under-Secretary to give an undertaking that, if this is not the right time, he will introduce an Amendment to the London Government Act as soon as possible to bring London into line with the rest of the country. I know, however, that he will not do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Northants, South (Mr. Arthur Jones) put forward a barely credible defence of the Under-Secretary's attitude. I am sorry to have to say this. He referred us to Clause 50 and said, "Do not deal with it now. Clause 50 is the time to deal with it". I remind hon. Gentlemen of the contents of Clause 50. Clause 50 relates to the
	<br><blockquote><p>"Duty and power to review local government areas in England".</p></blockquote>
Subsection (1)(	<i>b</i>) is to consider:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… the boundaries between Greater London and the counties adjoining it and between the City and the London boroughs adjoining it".</p></blockquote>
It does not deal with the constitution at all. When the hon. Gentleman put this forward as the Clause to deal with it, he must have known that it did not deal with
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1138</span>
the constitution of London government. The present Amendment is the correct place to deal with it. For the hon. Gentleman is saying that we should deal with it on Clause 50 is to send the Committee into a blind alley.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He mentioned the causing of hardship to London government if the Amendment were to be carried at this time. I wonder whether he has any concept of the hardship caused to many local authorities up and down the country. This will be a time of major upheaval for them. There will be shadow councils and all the paraphernalia of handing over. Two councils will be in existence at the same time, the one divesting its responsibilities piecemeal on to the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is not a hardship, I do not know what is, but we think it worthwhile. If that is worthwhile, to establish uniformity of treatment throughout the country, including London, is worth the hardship it might cause London government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Under-Secretary will reconsider this matter. The feeling has been unanimous; the defence has been feeble.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) has said, the Government are in an impossible position here. The hon. Lady the Member for Merton and Morden (Miss Fookes) put the issue before the Committee very concisely and precisely. She said that there is no issue of principle on this. I am sure that the Under-Secretary would agree that there is no issue of principle. To have indirectly elected, or non-elected, members of local authorities, is wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Maddan) moved an Amendment in this Committee to recreate aldermen. Albeit the proposals of the County Councils Association would considerably diminish the powers of aldermen, we sprang to the Government's defence and said that the Government were right. In very forceful and vivid language the Under-Secretary expressed his belief in the salutary effects of direct elections to local authorities. Clearly, the principle of the abolition of aldermen, direct election, having all members of the local authority elected by the the people, is accepted by both sides of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only possible reason that the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0619">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1139</span>
Government could advance for a different system in London is that London is a different kind of local authority. That argument might have some sense, but the Government do not say that. There might be some merit in the Government saying in this Committee, "We in the Government do not believe that councillors who are elected in London democratically are competent to carry on the affairs of their districts or the county council. Therefore, we must have a separate layer, the tier of aldermen, indirectly elected or brought in from outside, to do the job. We do not believe in the competence of Londoners to govern their own place".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, the Government do not say that. It would be nonsense. The Under-Secretary relies on the fact that this Bill does not deal with London and that this would clutter up the Bill. My hon. Friend mentioned that the whole Schedule deals with nothing but London. If we do not want to deal with London in the Bill, why is Schedule 2 there at all?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not only Schedule 2. If hon. Gentlemen look through the Bill they will see that most of the Clauses directly affect government in London, and many relate specifically only to London and London boroughs, the Greater London Council and the City. The Long Title clearly suggests that it does not exclude London. It makes provision with respect to local government and the functions of local authorities in England and Wales. London has not declared U.D.I.; it is still part of England; therefore, it is covered by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For instance, Clause 9 relates specifically to London. In Clause 49:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Proposals for changes in local government areas in England",</p></blockquote>
many of the subsections relate only to London. It gives directions and rules and regulations for the Boundary Commission to deal with the boundaries of London boroughs and the Greater London Council. Within London, Clause 75 deals with the change of name of "county, district or London borough". Clause 78 gives rules covering the "change of name in Greater London".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to follow the hon. Gentleman as he goes through particular Clauses. The specific purpose of the first Clause to which he referred,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1140</span>
Clause 9, was to make sure that Clauses 2 to 8 did not apply to London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed; that Clause takes London out. I accept that. Other Clauses, however, deal specifically with the rules and regulations of, for example, the Boundary Commission, to deal with the boundaries of London boroughs. If, as the hon. Gentleman says, we are not dealing with London, we should not be dealing with London at all. But we are dealing with London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government are presenting Schedule 2 at all, one might have thought that they would have listened to the kind of representations we heard from the hon. Member for Hove. He spoke about Oldham in a somewhat feeble defence—not put up by the hon. Gentleman, but by the county council and the A.M.C.—for the retention of aldermen, which this Committee wholly rejected. Even they suggested that aldermen should not be elected for six-year terms but for four-year terms. That will not apply to London. In the Schedule it is still six years for London. Even they suggested that there should be an age limit on aldermen. My hon. Friend quoted the well-known rhyme from "1066 and All That", "Too old to die", but there is no age limit so far as London is concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Worst of all—I am grateful for this—an Amendment was accepted by the Government with regard to chairmen of district and county councils, stating that persons who were not elected should not be created chairmen. Again, for aldermen in London there is not only indirect election, but they are allowed to co-opt people on to the councils who are not duly elected members of those councils. The Government are totally illogical in defending the position with regard to London. I do not know why they have dual thoughts about London as distinct from the rest of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that they are concerned with the City of London. I share my hon. Friend's views about the City of London. If anything is to happen to this sideshow it should be as an adjunct of the English Tourist Board. If hon. Gentlemen opposite are worried about the aldermen of the City of London, let them say so, and let us not have this system of aldermen for the whole of the Greater London area. The Government are in an impossible position. Let them think again. If they

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the course of a very interesting speech that he made in Committee on 27th January the Under-Secretary made a remarkable survey of the reasons why there should not be aldermen. There are touches of languages which I might not have used, but in general his arguments were ones of which I heartily approve. He believed that
	<br><blockquote><p>"responsibility should lie—and should be seen to lie—with the directly elected representatives."</p></blockquote>
Who can quarrel with that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He went on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I have always been slightly worried about the argument that there are these mystical figures who should have a privileged contribution to make without doing the difficult, burdensome and hard work that other people in public life must do."</p></blockquote>
That is a good point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He went on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I believe that it is extremely important that people in local and national government should be responsive to people to whom they are responsible."</p></blockquote>
One cannot fault that argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The image of local government is something that we must be particularly concerned about.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>… For those four reasons, I would say to my hon. Friend"—</p></blockquote>
that is, the hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Maddan)—
	<br><blockquote><p>"that despite the heavy weight of authorities which he is able to quote on this side, the Government feel that this is a matter of principle on which they would have to stand firm."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee D,</i> 27th January, 1972; 	<i>cc.</i> 1058–1059.]</p></blockquote>
We ask a new kind of riddle: when is a matter of principle not a matter of prin-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1142</span>
ciple? When it applies to Greater London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us deal with the Under-Secretary's case. I have often noticed that if a Minister does not have much of a case, he says, "I will think again about it", but if a Minister has a totally impossible case, he says, "Now is not the time. Some other legislation and some wiser Under-Secretary will come along and give you all you want."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend for Pontypridd (Mr. John) pointed out, one can wait for the Greek Kalends and this wiser Under-Secretary will not come along. It is now that we want to see action taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What were the Under-Secretary's arguments? First, he produced what I can only describe as Heseltine's Law: when in doubt, quote the previous Government's White Paper, whether relevant or not. As he was very much in doubt, he did so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He did not quote it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, he did. He quoted from page 7, paragraph 13, of the Labour Government's White Paper, which said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Government are not proposing to alter the structure of the London authorities or the distribution of functions between them."</p></blockquote>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Mr. John) pointed out, one can wait for the Greek Kalends and this wiser Under-Secretary will not come along. It is now that we want to see action taken.
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government agree with the Commission that the new main authorities and local councils should be composed of members directly elected by the people, and should not include aldermen. They will consult the authorities concerned about the future of aldermen in Greater London."</p></blockquote>
This could not have been clearer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that what the right hon. Member equates as the categoric assurance from his hon. Friend that there would be no aldermen in London in the future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must remember that there is a difference between a White Paper and a Bill. On the White Paper one consults—and there is no question that it was Labour Party policy to abolish aldermen everywhere. Greater London was not to be the end of the story; nor may it be, in terms of Amendments to the Bill.

11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary does not use that argument in respect of the present Government's White Paper, because there is nothing in it about aldermen. This is the subsection of Heseltine's Law: if one can get a bit of dirt in about a Labour Government's White Paper, one assumes that that is the last word, except in the case of paragraph 76, when one forgets about it. If we deal with the present Government's White Paper we assume that the Bill will be wiser—that it will differ from the White Paper, but that that will not matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We remember such questions as building regulations, the boundaries of Hum-berside, and the fact that many other considerable changes have been made between the Government's White Paper and the Bill. I do not object to that. Of course there are wiser counsels. But in future the Under-Secretary should remember that whereas we had a White Paper we were never able to publish a Bill. Secondly, if he must quote from our White Paper he should at least quote the truth, and not something totally erroneous. I have no doubt that he will withdraw when he replies. I shall be glad to hear the end both of the Labour Party's White Paper and the Government's in his arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first part of his case was that the White Papers differed in this respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have now proved that they did not. Secondly, there was the principle on which, in an earlier series of Amendments, the Government were to stand firm—a party of principle led by a man of principle. Dear me! that principle might involve re-warding and dislocation, and we cannot have principles affected by terrible things like that. Principles with modification—that is the watchword of the Government. It ignores the fact that if we accept the principle, and that it is right to turn that principle into practice, some Government will have to deal with the problem—will have to re-ward, and make the necessary changes. The Under-Secretary does not deny that. He merely pushes it into the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If principles with modification is the watchword of this Government, what was the watchword of the last Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1144</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Principle. The hon. Gentleman asked for that. If one intervenes, one should always know what the answer will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Coming back to the point at issue, if it is accepted that this has to be done, the question is when does one do it. Is there any logic in saying: "We will alter the local government of England. Despite the Opposition's protests, we will alter the local government of Wales in the same Bill. But we have decided that Greater London shall be outside"? Perhaps that is because Greater London was reorganised nine years ago. That is a long time. We have seen changes. We now see changes throughout the country. That is not a good argument. If the Local Government Bill becomes law this year, apart from boundary reviews, which are neither here nor there, we shall not see any constitutional change in local government in our generation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What real difference does it make? It makes the difference that we could have the absurd anomaly, having rejected the aldermanic principle for the whole country for the four excellent reasons given by the Under-Secretary, we shall have preserved it in Greater London although both Parties—I do not go as far as some of my hon. Friends in their strictures on the Party opposite—saying that this is totally illogical, that it is nonsense and that they should like to do without it. Both of them in the years to come may be victims of what I described as the fiddling of aldermanic vacancies—the Under-Secretary himself referred to that in his speech on Thursday last. Both of them will be deploring it but they will be forced to carry on with this archaic method simply because the Under-Secretary thinks that there might be some dislocation. I can only say that if he defers it the dislocation will be infintely greater.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have tried to make a reasoned case on practice as well as on principle in this matter. As far as I can see, 90 per cent. of the Committee accepts the principle. Both sides are agreed. So what on earth are we waiting for? There may be much hard work; there may be some consequential changes. I accept the fact that, if one takes a seventh of the aldermen away, there may have to be some ward adjustments, but they will have to be made some time. It has been said before me that,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0622">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1145</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well it were done quickly."</p></blockquote>
That seems to be not a bad basis for any politician.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether to put on my most brazen face at this moment in view of the comments of the right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin). I can well understand the approach of anybody who, faced on Committee with a Bill, a legislative vehicle, tries to introduce into that vehicle a number of matters which are not strictly within the purpose for which the vehicle was originally introduced. It is a temptation which all of us in Committees have always found attractive and all of us, particularly in Opposition, have found ourselves yielding to, because Members of the Opposition can put down proposals which they have in mind or which have been suggested to them with the hope of getting them introduced into early legislation. I have done this myself on a number of occasions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not follow what the Minister is saying. This is in the Bill and we are seeking to amend it. Therefore his preamble is quite irrelevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for the Hartlepools (Mr. Leadbitter) has shown himself on a number of occasions incapable of understanding the points I make; it is therefore not surprising that he does not understand the purpose of the preamble, which is to lead to the point where I make it as clear as I can that the purpose of Schedule 2 has been misunderstood by hon. Members opposite. Its purpose is not to reform or re-organise local government in London; it is merely to consolidate two particular Bills which can then be repealed and to leave the existing situation exactly as it is. I am referring to the Local Government Act, 1933 and the London Government Act, 1963. This is simply a repetition of the existing situation, a matter of legal convenience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid I am dense about this. Will the hon. Gentleman explain, then, why the Long Title did not exclude London?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because there are incidental aspects of the legislation. One of the questions raised is the question of the boundary reviews at a subsequent period,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1146</span>
which do relate to London, but are incidental—this is the important point. There was no intention of this Government, or I believe, of the last Government, to extend the broad reorganisation of local government to include London. In Schedule 2, one finds a 	<i>status quo</i> situation, a matter of convenience, a re-statement of the existing situation. There are no changes implied or proposed in Schedule 2 in the organisation of London government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now have one of the most remarkable propositions which has ever been put before Parliament, namely, that, when Parliament decides to have a consolidation Measure, one cannot look at whether changes are necessary in it. This has never been accepted anywhere in Parliament. All the consolidation Measures that have ever come before Parliament have been subject to change. It is one of the purposes of a consolidation Measure that, whilst one is consolidating, one is not re-affirming automatically everything in the previous legislation. Parliament in that case would waste hours of its time. It is a remarkable proposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that is strictly accurate. I have heard on many occasions hon. Members in committees saying how much more convenient it would be, instead of having to refer from one Bill to another, to have a consolidation of existing historical Bills in the most modern Bill. I am not a lawyer myself but I believe that this is a matter of great convenience for lawyers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore it is wrong to suggest, when we take the opportunity to consolidate, simply for the convenience of those who have to administer and understand these matters in great detail, that it should automatically be assumed that the intention of the Government was then to bring the matter up for review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the fact that the Government took the decision that the purpose of the Bill was not the reorganisation of local government in London. I believe that was the right decision. It was precisely the decision taken by the preceding Government when they looked at the situation in the same way as we did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I come to the Labour Government's White Paper? I accept at once that White Papers are a pretty firm inten-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0623">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1147</span>
lion of what Governments intend, but that all Governments change the detail in some way or another as a result of consultations following the White Paper. It is, however, a perfectly valid point for me to make that, if one takes paragraphs 13 and 76 of the Labour Government White Paper, which could have a bearing on the discussion we are having this morning, it is perfectly clear that no categorical assurance was given, as the hon. Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) said, that aldermen in London would be brought to an end. I do not think there is any purpose in my reading out paragraph 13 of the White Paper again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is not a lawyer, and one must forgive him for not being a lawyer, but paragraph 13 has nothing to do with the case. It merely refers to the distribution of functions between one authority and another. The real basis of it, if one has to have these rather "old hat" and old-fashioned arguments—personally I am against them—is in paragraph 76. To say that the Government of the day believe that councils should be directly elected by the people and should not include aldermen and that they will have consultations about the future of aldermen in Greater London is as near a categorical imperative as one can have in a White Paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is a lawyer, and I should have thought that, in giving advice to his clients and to the Committee, it would be incumbent upon him to read the whole of the relevant extract from any document in front of him. There, one has an assurance in these terms:
	<br><blockquote><p>"While some of the Commission's proposals (for example on matters affecting the election and constitution of local authorities) has general implications, the Government are not proposing to alter the structure of the London authorities."</p></blockquote>
If the structure of the London authorities does not embrace the question of those people who make up those authorities, then I do not know what the word "structure" means. I believe that that is a perfectly unanswerable introduction, in paragraph 13, to paragraph 76.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 76, although saying straight away that the Government agree with the Redcliffe-Maud Commission that the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1148</span>
main authorities should not include aldermen, then goes on to say that they will consult the authorities concerned about the future of aldermen in Greater London. What were those consultations to be about?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Timing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no question of timing. There is no reference at all in paragraph 76 to the question of timing. The question which is the subject of consultation is the future of aldermen. In other words, paragraph 76 implies a future for aldermen in Greater London. That follows from paragraph 13, which makes it perfectly clear that the last Government had no intention of dealing with the structure of local government in London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I really must put it to the Under-Secretary that what he is saying now is ingenious almost to the point of dishonesty. Paragraph 76 must be taken as a whole. I am not a lawyer, but I know enough about the law to know that one cannot divorce the second sentence of a paragraph from the first. The construction which the courts put upon it is what the paragraph as a whole says. Paragraph 76 could not be more explicit. The first sentence says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government agree with the Commission that the new main authorities and local councils should be composed of members directly elected by the people, and should not include aldermen."</p></blockquote>
That sentence includes the Greater London Council. It expressly refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the new main authorities and local councils".</p></blockquote>
This paragraph affects the whole of local government. It is a declaration of principle about aldermen. It goes on to say, as a matter of courtesy—it will be a surprise to this Minister to know that the last Government did attach some importance to consulting people about their future; the present Government consults very few people about anything—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I? It is my speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know it is the hon. Gentleman's speech. I am enlivening his speech and I hope making it a little more intelligible than it has been up to now. The purpose—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sure that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0624">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1149</span>
the hon. Gentleman appreciates that he is making far too long an intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do indeed, Sir Stephen. If I might just finish, the sentence clearly says that Greater London will be consulted "about the future of aldermen". That clearly refers to the way in which they are to be abolished, the timing, and all the mechanisms involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Small Heath has added to my case. He quotes from paragraph 76 that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government agree with the Commission that the new main authorities and local councils …".</p></blockquote>
He then omits to quote from paragraph 13 that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Royal Commission's terms of reference did not include Greater London".</p></blockquote>
It is therefore patently clear to us all that the "new main authorities" referred to in paragraph 76 do not include Greater London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Read the next sentence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will read the next sentence. It is perfectly clear. There is no reference at all here to the abolition of aldermen in London. There is reference to consultation. The only place where there is reference to aldermen being abolished is under the heading of "the new main authorities", and London is not one of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to make party points about this, but large numbers of people became increasingly dismayed to read what Members of the last Government said, which they thought they understood, and then to discover in practice that they meant something totally different. I can only assume that this is an example of that kind. I do not believe that anyone had any doubt that the London reorganisation of 1963 was not going to be changed in any legislation introduced by the last Government in this respect. The White Paper can be interpreted perfectly clearly in that direction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Paraphrasing a very unfortunate statement made by the Minister the other day about feeling certain parts of the anatomy, I suggest that he ought to be feeling the pulse of the people of London, particularly those in authority, between his fingertips instead of using the other argument. He will discover, I am

sure, that it is the general wish of those with responsibility that aldermen should go in the city of London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That raises another question, which was raised by the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Swain) when he first made his speech. It is perfectly clear that the City of London is in no way affected by the Schedule or the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. I meant the County of London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can deal with the two points. The whole Committee will understand that the City of London, whose status is governed by Charter or by local Acts, is in no way covered by the Amendment or by the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. I apologise for using the word "city". I meant the County of London. I hope that the Under-Secretary will not misconstrue—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is not a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member referred to the City of London, as I think did one or two of his hon. Friends. I just clarify this point. I have no wish to avoid the main discussion. I merely wish to clarify the point that the City of London is not involved in this discussion or in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The test of opinion, as to whether aldermen should stay or not, is not the difficulty with which we are confronted. The difficulty is whether we take the Bill to encompass the structure and constitution and division of functions in London or not. We take the view that that is not the purpose of the legislation and that to take on the task so soon after the recent reorganisation would impose a burden upon the local government structure which would be untenable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The local government reorganisation of the city of Sheffield took place in 1967, some years after the reorganisation of the County of London.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member will appreciate that I do not have a detailed

knowledge of his particular constituency, but I assume that he is referring to a re-warding exercise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A reorganisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It could not have been a reorganisation in the sense of what we are doing in the Bill. It might perhaps have been a re-warding exercise for which the staff would have been available because it was largely a "one-off" exercise which could be done in a relatively calm situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with a situation in which we are under great pressure to get early elections at district level and in which we have to make all the electoral arrangements in time for county and district elections all over the country. In that situation there is immense strain, as everybody involved in the exercise knows. We should therefore be in an impossible situation if we tried to extend the scope of the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned in my first speech the consequential work which would flow from a decision of this kind in terms of the abolition of aldermen. The hon. Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper), I think, asked whether I could explain in more detail what the problems would be. The problems flow from the reduction in the size of the Greater London Council. There would immediately be not 116 members as at present but 100 members. That means that approximately one-sixth more work would have to be done by all the people involved. That would impose upon those people an additional burden of work with the consequences which have been mentioned in the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Small Heath says that that applies to all the other new authorities, but it does not. The other new authorities have had their quota of representatives fixed with regard to the aggregate of aldermen and councillors in the preceding authority. I use the words "with regard to" because one cannot totally equate the two. However, within broad bands, for the number of new councillors—about which my hon. Friend the Minister of State, Home Office was responsible for consulting authorities—the aggregate of councillors and aldermen in the authorities to be replaced has been the criterion fixed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

then disagree—I have never heard him disagree before—with the view of the Redcliffe-Maud Commission that the main authority councils should not have more than 75 members? The Commission thought it very difficult for large councils to be
	<br><blockquote><p>"effective instruments for the transaction of public business, and in particular for the control of policy."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question is not whether I agree or disagree about the number of people. It is a question of whether one can get to the stage of redrawing the boundaries in time to make this possible. The question of the number of people is something which has to be looked at within broad bounds every time one takes on board an organisation of this kind. The Government are in fact making provision for rather more councillors in new councils than is implied in that proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary is quite wrong. The present Government's Bill, he has told us, does not affect Greater London, so he is not making provision for larger councils so far as Greater London is concerned. He is perfectly able to reduce the number by 16 without any difficulty at all and with good authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point is that we are not taking the figure of the Redcliffe-Maud Commission of 75 members; our top band for counties ranges between 60 and 90 councillors. Everybody would accept that the G.L.C. has some of the largest and most complex problems in the country. In our judgment it would present further problems to try to get through the rewording exercise that would be necessary in order to increase the number of councillors to equate with the present numbers of councillors and aldermen who would be replaced under the proposals that we are now discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the practical difficulty of asking those people who are now carrying out the preparation of the electoral processes and the warding exercise to take on board another major exercise. We do not feel able to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Mer-ton and Morden (Miss Fookes) raised an understandable question—whether, with the difficulties involved in abolishing aldermen there could not be some
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0626">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1153</span>
machinery. I put it to her that if there were to be another review of local government in London—it is perfectly understandable, and something that any Government might want to do—it would be reasonable to consider the whole range of electoral and warding problems, and the constitutional size of the council, at that time, and to deal with the matter in specific legislation; not just to take one specific aspect, such as the abolition of aldermen, but to look at the problems that would follow. If the Government decided that that was a priority for legislative time on a future occasion it would be right to deal with it in total, and not just to provide machinery at this stage for doing it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman, by his careful qualification, is implying that the Government intend to perpetuate the anomalous situation in London. Will he not give a clear undertaking that as soon as practicable he will review the London legislation to bring the question of aldermen in line with the rest of the country?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I was not giving the impression that there was a determination to preserve the present situation for all time. That certainly is not my intention. The right hon. Member for Deptford has quoted my own views on this subject and I do not wish to withdraw from them for one moment. But it is not for me to commit this Government, or any subsequent Government of either party, to some future legislative process. In the way in which legislative bids are made throughout the Government machine there is such a range of options for our attention that it is impossible to say what legislation may be introduced next session, let alone in three or four years' time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is entirely for hon. Members opposite to decide what sort of pledges they wish to give, in the same way as it is for my party, through the Government machine, to decide what pledges they feel able to give in the present context. Having carried through a major reorganisation of London in 1963, and now being engaged in carrying through the most imaginative reorganisation of local government for some 70 or 80 years, we do not feel it right to mix the two. But this is entirely without commitment to any future decisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1154</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary has given us exactly the point. It is our feeling that if it is not done now it will never be done, never mind about for the end of time; but certainly for the next 20 to 30 years. The Under-Secretary has put up no defence on principle—just a defence which is very weak on grounds of hardship to some unspecified people who have to draw new wards. If it is possible to do this now, the hon. Gentleman ought to be with us in trying to carry it through, and not putting up this flaccid explanation of why it is impossible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We must not have interventions going on at too great a length. I deplore too long an intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not usually guilty of that. I am making the point that the Under-Secretary may not be able to commit the Government to a change in the law, but he is committing the Government to a perpetuation of an anomalous situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am saying that the Government do not feel able to take on board the reorganisation of London government. We therefore draw a hard line of principle on this issue. Hon. Members opposite take the view that this debate raises a burning issue, where the principle would be rightly infringed, but the fact is that as the debate goes on I have no doubt that there will be a whole range of other examples where we should try either to move the reforms into London or—and this case has come up time and again in consultation—seek to change the powers and to give additional powers to local authorities, of a sort which are outside the structure of powers or the division of powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall come to that point. It is very difficult, because this is a Bill of very wide dimensions, and in order to try to focus our attention on the main task in hand it is right to ask the Committee to stick to the principle that the structure, constitution and division of functions within London are not considered something for reform under this legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Tory I could feel sorry for him. The hon. Gentleman has scraped the bottom of the barrel for his arguments this morning. He stands there and tries to explain to us what our White Paper meant. He assumes the mantle of authority—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I was not clear whether the Minister was giving way, or whether he had finished his speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was giving way to my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack), but as the right hon. Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. George Thomas) had a birthday recently I thought we could extend the privilege to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We had better return to the debate in an orderly fashion. If the hon. Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack) will make his intervention, which I hope will be brief, the Minister can resume his speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful, Sir Stephen. I was merely going to ask my hon. Friend whether it might not be a good idea to delete the whole of Schedule 2, or whether it is constitutionally necessary that it should be in the Bill? If it could be deleted and the whole of the consideration of London removed from this Bill the matter would be open for future legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suppose that what my hon. Friend is suggesting is possible. Certainly the law would not be deficient if this were to happen, but it would be inconvenient. One of the arguments always put forward by lawyers is that legislation should be kept up to date, so that they have only one Act to study. I am talking in a technical sense of having the existing state of art in one document. That makes sense. As for the convenience of those who must administer these provisions in local government and in legal terms I believe that it is right to maintain Schedule 2 as it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having given that answer, I have finished my speech and perhaps I can now sit down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I interrupted the Under-Secretary and the hon. Gentleman. I believe that the Under-Secretary is a Welshman from Swansea.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1156</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated assent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may explain his misuse of the English language on the last occasion, when he was struggling to express himself. The hon. Gentleman, who spent his youth in Swansea, will know that we have our own views about the powers given to London compared with our own capital city in Wales. The Minister carefully avoided the major arguments submitted by my right hon. and hon. Friends this morning and gave us a fruitless theological argument about what the Labour Government might have done, or were going to do. It reminded me of the argument about how many angels can stand on the head of a pin. It is the sort of argument that Welshmen enjoy on a Sunday afternoon, but it had nothing at all to do with the case that the hon. Gentleman was supposed to pursue this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept from me that we know better than he can possibly know what the intentions of the Labour Government, as expressed in that White Paper, were. The hon. Gentleman is not exactly modest in his claims, but I can assure him that the very fact that we included in our White Paper a determination to consult the London boroughs on the question of aldermen meant that we were quite prepared for action, and I believe that people outside the Committee will accept that that is so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman was in difficulty this morning because of his arguments on the aldermanic question. All of us have our own experiences, Sir Stephen; no doubt you have in Southend, as I have in Cardiff. I recall making a speech in the House which offended one of the aldermen in the City of Cardiff. From time to time we lapse. The alderman immediately made an issue of it and called upon the electorate to reject me at the next election. The only response that I could make was that the electorate in Cardiff would be very lucky to have a chance to turn him out, as it was 39 years since he had fought an election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The idea that we should tell the people that in this great metropolitan city of London these superior bodies who will not, or dare not, face election, but who want to be on the local authority, these ornaments, will still be provided, makes no sense at all. We are liberating local
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0628">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1157</span>
government throughout the rest of the country: the one good thing in the Bill is that we are saying goodbye to all these party games about aldermen. Both sides of the House have irritated the public by the way the aldermanic situation has been played with, when the will of the people is flouted because there is a hang-over of non-elected people able to give the majority to the wrong side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why should this be permitted in the greatest city in the world? I am quite willing to concede to my right hon. Friend the Member for Deptford (Mr. Silkin) that all of us, from all parts of the United Kingdom, have a great pride in the City of London and all that it stands for. That it should lack real democracy in its local government is offensive to every instinct in me. I believe that the hon. Gentleman revealed the arrogance of the Government this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Reed</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How many peers did the Labour Government appoint to the other place when they were in government? Was that democratic?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was never very good at mental arithmetic; I cannot tell the hon. Gentleman. All I hope is that the lists are still open.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman reminded me of Lord Shawcross, who now, I think, belongs to the other party: he certainly does not belong to ours, although by some accident he once sat on our benches. He used the phrase, which he might have believed but which we did not like, "We are the masters now". The whole philosophy of the Under-Secretary this morning is that he is the master now, with the hon. Gentleman sitting next to him. All the argument this morning has been one-sided, and the hon. Gentleman deliberately chose not to deal with the main issue, which I regard as a principle, but rather to have this tedious theological argument about whether we are as black as they are, or they are as white as we are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a proposal from his hon. Friend the Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack) that it might be a way out to delete the Schedule altogether. This might be a useful precedent. May I invite him and the missing Minister of State, who no doubt will soon be back, to delete the Welsh section?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1158</span>
May I say to the Minister that we are here embarked on the greatest measure of local government reform undertaken in the lifetime of the oldest person in the land. It is logical, in this Bill, to have harmony throughout the whole country. My hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Mr. John) is absolutely right: if this aldermanic question is not solved now, we all know that the Under-Secretary could be an old-age pensioner before statutory reforms are introduced into a local government Measure in this House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have made a reasonable case; we have not sought to make party points. We have dealt with the question of local democracy. I really believe that it is arrogant to suggest that the local government of London must somehow be different from the local government of the capital city of Wales. It is something that the hon. Gentleman ought to be the last to put forward. I hope that the Government will see that we are trying to help them and that at the last moment they will undertake to look at this again before Report. If not, I believe that this is such an important issue that I hope my right hon. and hon. Friends will register an opinion in the country so that the reactionary nature of the party opposite may be revealed once again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to intervene at length. One is tempted, when thinking of my hon. Friend, to think of St. Paul and ask why he must kick against the pricks. I should like to urge him to take very careful note of the suggestion that I put to him. As I have understood his argument—and Members opposite are being less than kind to my hon. Friend in quoting both Macbeth and the Mikardo Act in a single morning—it was that Schedule 2 is in the Bill purely and simply for the lawyers' convenience, and that it would therefore be silly to amend the Schedule, as one would then be amending London government in only one particular and in isolation. If this is his argument, surely my suggestion when I intervened a little while ago would be sensible—that we should remove the Schedule entirely. The whole question is then open, the fears of hon. Gentlemen opposite that London government is fossilised in this Bill in this particular way would be removed, and we could look at it again at a later date and in considerable detail.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0629">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1159</span>
I ask him most earnestly to consider that suggestion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Lamond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer given by the Under-Secretary to the debate this morning was most disappointing. I am always prepared to listen with an open mind to the Government's point of view, as I understood we had established the principle, with the support of many Members on both sides, that the aldermanic system should be abolished. I therefore wanted to hear why the Government did not wish to extend this to London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not agree with the point of the hon. Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack) that we should delete this Schedule from the Bill. I can appreciate that the Government wish to simplify as far as possible the Local Government Act, and there are some 30 pages of repeals included in this Bill before us. Would it not also simplify local government if the system in London were the same as in the rest of the country—the same, may I add, as has obtained in Scotland for a long time? They have had no aldermen in Scotland and they seem to have managed surprisingly well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seemed that even the Under-Secretary had accepted this principle. He was one of those who said that we should not have aldermen any more. In his argument he referred to what was said in our White Paper—this was irrelevant and was merely to bolster his argument—and he told us that the Government are trying to adhere to another principle, namely not starting any reorganisation in London. He said that if the Government were to recognise this simple but quite outstanding change that could be made in London—and this has been widely accepted in the Committee, in Parliament as a whole and throughout the country—this could open the gate to other changes—some necessary—such as re-warding, so that the number of councils in London could be increased, presumably, to take account of the number of aldermen who would be lost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That suggests that there is some magic number, with which all councils can act efficiently, that if they fall below that number they become inefficient, and it is intolerable to have more than that number. I do not accept that. I know, for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1160</span>
example, that a county borough like Oldham, with about 105,000 inhabitants, had a council, including aldermen, of 52. The City of Aberdeen, an all-purpose authority, with a population of 185,000—very considerably more than Oldham, almost 80,000 more—functions quite satisfactorily with a council of 37. This is far smaller than the Oldham town council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that a council will adjust its efficiency to the number of members that are available to carry out the necessary work. Incidentally, I believed that even 37 was large for the efficient running of local government in a city of 185,000. When there is a large number of councillors there is a temptation to increase the number of committees so that councillors can become chairmen of committees and every councillor is on a certain number of committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not really a matter of principle. If we do abolish aldermen, it need not necessarily lead to far-ranging changes in local government in London. It is an important matter which would be recognised as a good thing by most people in this country. I do not see why the Government do not seize this opportunity to do it with the least inconvenience and in the easiest possible way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister had no intention in his last intervention to mislead the Committee. In response to a remark made by my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Swain), he said that there were no references in the Bill to the City of London. I draw his attention to Clause 43(2), Clause 50(6), Clause 79(1)(	<i>b</i>), Clause 93(2)(	<i>a</i>), Clause 106, Clause 174(1), Clause 198, Clause 201(2), and most important, the interpretation Clause, Clause 248. The Minister will agree that at this stage—though I hope not by the time the Bill leaves this Committee—there are all these references to the City of London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad of the opportunity to clarify what I thought I said. I think I said that there was no reference to the City of London in the debate that we were having about aldermen, or in Schedule 2. That is what I meant to imply. The hon. Gentlemen went through
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0630">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1161</span>
his points with a speed which I found totally mesmerising, but doubtless we shall catch up. Certainly, in electoral and aldermanic terms, the City of London is not covered by Schedule 2.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's words were "in this Bill". Indeed, there are many references; and "local government area", which is being dealt with in this Part, does include the City of London. It would appear to me that with appropriate Amendments to some of the Clauses to which I have made reference, one would also be dealing with the aldermen of the City of London as well as all the other archaic elements of that institution. However, that is not altogether relevant to this Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a rather dangerous constitutional precedent in what the Minister said about the apparent unamendability of the Schedule. We seem to be getting rather close to the secondary legislation which we shall discuss subsequently in another Bill which is coming before the House, and in which I understand certain measures are unamendable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I had thought of making the position clear when the Minister was speaking, but I will do so now. This Bill is not a Consolidation Bill. As hon. Gentlemen know, a Consolidation Bill simply brings together several previous Acts of Parliament into a single Measure, and it is true that that cannot be amended. These Schedules bring together provisions from other Bills for the general convenience of those who will use the legislation. That does not make it a Consolidation Bill, and it is open to amendment, as are all Bills.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely grateful, Sir Stephen, for your authoritative confirmation of my remarks. No doubt, the Minister will have taken the import of what you have said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now come to the substantial point made by the Minister, in which he referred to the considerable pressure on the Home Office in terms of re-warding and working out electoral details. Yet, he insisted that one would have to increase the size of the councils of both the Greater London Council and London borough councils consequential upon the abolition of aldermen. Then I concede that some pressure would be put upon
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1162</span>
the hard-working civil servants in the Home Office, who have been involved in the district warding proposals. It seems slightly odd, however, that the Minister makes this point today, when we learned, for the first time, that the Government were intending to bring forward the elections for the district councils from November, 1973, to June, 1973. This suggests that there is some capacity within the Home Office, having been able to bring forward elections by five months. However, I do not wish to press that point. It may be that, in the form in which the Amendment has been put forward, using, as we do in the first of the Amendments, the date of 1973, we create certain practical problems. If the Minister were able to give us an assurance that the Government would bring forward Amendments similar to this but with, for example, the year of 1975 or 1976 instead of 1973, in order to obviate the difficulty which might fall otherwise upon the civil servants in the Home Office. I would be happy for these Amendments to be withdrawn and in their place a Government Amendment with the date of 1975 or 1976 on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Blenkinsop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has been my experience during a number of years in the House that, from time to time, a Department tends to put up what I regard as an artificial barrier against new issues being raised. The Department counsels the Minister to try to hold a particular position. This has happened very often. There always has to be some kind of division about what is to be dealt with in a Bill and what is not. Title gives one a good deal to go upon. It is certainly not for us in the Committee necessarily to accept any arbitrary ruling of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Throughout the country there is a good deal of resentment at what is sometimes regarded as special privilege or special dealings for London. Certainly it is expected that any case for difference should be clearly made out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are hosts of people who have enjoyed—or have suffered, whatever is the best word—the role of alderman for many years in the past. We are asking them to give it up and either to contest seats like everybody else or to retire from council service. I do not imagine that that is an easy thing for many of my colleagues and friends to do. I know some who have faced the situation and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0631">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1163</span>
are declaring either that they are withdrawing or that they intend to fight a seat as a councillor. They resent the idea that London should be treated in a different way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a party issue. The Government have indicated in a radical way their desire generally to sweep away aldermen. I welcome that. This is an issue in respect of which the Committee should rise in modest revolt and say that it believes that this is an occasion when we should clear up the matter for the whole country and not just for the area outside London. I hope that in spite of the valiant efforts made by the Minister to hold the bridge, or prop up the dyke or carry out whatever function is proper for Ministers in this situation, he will now recognise that the task is hopeless, give up with good grace, and say that he will accept the principle of the Amendment and move a reworded Amendment on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fergus Montgomery</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am against the Government on this Amendment. It makes a complete nonsense to abolish aldermen in every other part of the country but retain them in London. I cannot see why London should be given any special favours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the West Midlands we had local government reorganisation in 1966. We are now faced with further local government reorganisation. When I protested about this I was told that one area could not be treated in isolation. London was reorganised in 1964 and was not touched on this occasion. This has caused a great deal of resentment in other parts of the country. Any special favours given to the London area will be entirely wrong, and I hope that before the Amendment is pressed hon. Friends on the Front Bench will seriously reconsider this point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for having to rise to my feet again. The debate has developed into a far more serious matter than the Under-Secretary indicated when he first spoke. He seemed to assume that there would be opposition from this side of the Committee. He could hardly have been aware of the similar feeling of concern among hon. Members on the Government side. The hon. Member for Brierley Hill (Mr. Montgomery) has been quite emphatic. He says that on this issue
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1164</span>
he is against the Government. The hon. Member for Merton and Morden (Miss Fookes), to her great credit, in a very brief but pertinent speech indicated positively her view on the matter. The hon. Member who is an alderman in Bedford spoke not quite so strongly, but he conveyed to the Committee reservations sufficient for us to be satisfied that he, too, was not totally happy with the present position. In such situations there is always something to learn or to pinpoint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary has fallen into a situation where we might remind ourselves of a pinpoint and that is the philosophy that when one is defending, one should duck, when one is doubtful, one should delegate—the Minister did that—and when in doubt, one should mumble. We have had the three d's today. This has been quite a performance on the part of the Under-Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we started this rather interesting dialogue about paragraphs 13 and 76 of the White Paper it was rather surprising to those members of the Committee who have not attended to these two paragraphs to hear the number of interpretations that hon. Members sought to place upon them. Although interesting, the reference was not particularly relevant, because the issue is concerned with a Government Measure that is now before the Committee. The Bill exists. The White Paper, to which reference was made, was only a White Paper; it went no further. A Bill was not produced arising from it. Therefore, the Government must not seek to duck. It is no good going back to 1933 or 1888, when the original, more pertinent Measures were responsible for the general structure of local government as we know it today; we have to deal with the question before us now.

I should have thought that this was of sufficient importance to merit the attention of the Minister. I should have thought that in this situation—which the Minister could have foreseen—where there would have to be some defending, and certainly some delegating, in view of the importance of the argument we might have had some response from the Minister. Unfortunately, the third part of the three-dimensional story—the mumbling—has been predominant.

There is resentment in the large cities. My right hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff West (Mr. George Thomas) mentioned the largest city in the Principality, of which he has positive experience as an ex-Minister, and as an elected Member of the House. There is bound to be resentment. The Minister said that the White Paper recommended momentous changes in local government. Momentous changes for whom, and with the exception of what? The Under-Secretary must not try to duck the argument by seeking safety in a White Paper which is now dead, and which has no effect on the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman dithered and then, surprisingly, began to look for excuses not in the White Paper but in the Bill. Schedule 2 suddenly became a consolidating Measure. He told us that this consolidating Measure had been placed before the Committee in such a way that he disliked our questioning it. He said that we were looking for ways and means of dealing with the situation which were contrary to his newly-discovered definition of the Schedule. I should have thought that his second error would have alarmed the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have looked again at Schedule 2. To me it is specific and part of the Local Government Bill. It comes within the general definition of local government reorganisation of England and Wales. Therefore, to describe Schedule 2 as a consolidating measure and, as a consequence, to attempt to parry the arguments from both sides of the Committee, is an error of judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nothing has been said about Amendment No. 430. It refers to Schedule 2, paragraph 1(1) where it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For Greater London there shall be … "</p></blockquote>
and the Amendment proposes to insert "from 1973". Since the Minister has always shown a willingness to look again at the situation where the argument is strong, as he did last week when he agreed that the question of Teesside should be discussed, he could follow that principle of generous approach and say that here was a matter upon which he had an open mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister cannot avoid these arguments. If he acts differently now from the way that he has done in the past when the arguments have been strong, it will be totally out of character. The argument
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1166</span>
has been sufficiently well deployed for him to respond, and I will now give him the chance to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question which we have now discussed for two and a half hours is extremely difficult, because we are trying to reconcile the principle of democratic representation and the difficulties which the previous Labour Government would have faced, and which the present Government face, in trying to carry through a massive reorganisation of local government, with the attendant strain that is bound to be placed on the staff and elected representatives in England and Wales. So we have tried to reach sensible boundaries and divisions beyond which we will not trespass, in order to carry through a major Bill within the time available. This is an argument which I have deployed this morning, where I may have appeared to be flying in the face of the principle in which I believe and have clearly spelt out, as the right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) said on an earlier occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill has never been intended by the Government as a declaration of principle to apply one way in London and another way throughout the rest of the country. The Government have shown great courage, in view of the hostility that it was bound to cause, in taking the initial decision on the abolition of the alder-manic bench. It was a courageous political decision, because either way it would have been controversial. The Government do not feel able to extend the work and burden that is imposed upon those who are helping us and upon whom depends the reorganisation with regard to London in the Bill. In drawing the Bill we have tried throughout to maintain a hard frontier on the issues of constitution, structure and election as it applies to London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This raises the question that was referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Merton and Morden (Miss Fookes) of an in-built machinery which could be produced at some future date. The hon. Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper) named dates of 1976 and 1977. In my speech I had tried to outline the practical difficulties which would face those who will have to carry out the changes. The Government are faced with what appears to be a contradiction in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0633">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1167</span>
principle, but what also appears to be an insurmountable barrier in terms of timing, to coincide the abolition of the aldermanic bench with the proposals for reorganisation of local government throughout England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the feelings of my hon. Friends and hon. Gentlemen opposite. In this case I will ask the Committee to allow the Government the opportunity between now and Report to examine the proposals put forward either by my hon. Friend or by the hon. Member for Farnworth, for a delayed implementation which removes the argument of the workload which has seemed insurmountable. We should see whether some such proposals could be introduced, if the arguments seem to justify it, on further reflection of the issues involved and in the light of representations that might be made to us. I cannot give an assurance that we will do this, because there are difficulties. I have to say that if it were possible to do this, we should be breaching a principle. I hope that the concession on a major democratic principle will not be called in aid as we go through the Bill, for a range of lesser principles which will doubtless be produced in overwhelming support of other cases which have yet to be pleaded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1168</span>
I hope that this is a helpful answer. We undertake to look at the proposals of my hon. Friend the Member for Farn-worth for a delayed implementation, which would overcome some of the objections about the workload that I put forward today. On that basis I hope that the right hon. Member will withdraw his Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been 2½ hours well spent. We have persuaded the Under-Secretary to think again, and thinking again is half way to common sense. Undoubtedly his thinking has been helped by the fact that, had there been a Division in the Committee, the Government would have lost. It is important that that should be remembered. I make no promises about extracting other democratic advantages from him. We will continue to do so. But in the spirit of what he has said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
