</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. R. A. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the disadvantages of starting the proceedings is that a number of the hon. Members opposite who have been very active in goading me to join the debate are regrettably not in their places. I can recall that over the last four sittings the hon. Members for Oldham, West (Mr. Meacher), Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton), Southall (Mr. Bidwell) and Rother-ham (Mr. O'Malley) have done this. One almost feels that one has a friend in the right hon. Lady the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle) because I think she is alone in not having suggested that the Committee would welcome a contribution from this side of the House. I hope she will stay with us nevertheless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am particularly sorry that the hon. Member for Oldham, West is not here, because I am about to pay him a compliment, which may surprise him. Nobody could have listened to his lengthy contribution—lasting about two hours I think—without being impressed by such a parliamentary 	<i>tour de force.</i> I hope his colleagues will pass that compliment on to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Marsden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to place
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>176</span>
on record that I have not goaded the hon. Gentleman to speak. I have little interest in contributions from hon. Members opposite in this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has contributed rather less than some of his colleagues to our discussions, which is perhaps why he has not had the opportunity the others have had of goading me. No doubt he will speak later in the debate, and we look forward to his contribution with interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Oldham, West made a major contribution to these debates and it would be churlish not to acknowledge it. On this side of the Committee we felt that his statistics in supporting the Amendments were, to say the least, slightly selective, but this does not detract from the fact that his was a considerable parliamentary performance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In dealing with these Amendments, we are really dealing with the amounts involved and to that extent are getting to the very heart of the Bill. I am conscious that in rising to disagree even mildly with the sentiments expressed by hon. Members opposite one might almost be thought to be indecent in opposing these modest increases that they seek. Yet, until we reach some sort of Utopia, which I suggest we have not yet reached, it is the duty of all hon. Members to combine the humanity and compassion which is so evident in the speeches from the other side of the House, especially since they have been in Opposition, with a realistic assessment of what the country can afford.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had the temerity to intervene the other day in the speech of the hon. Member for Oldham, West and it seems that I touched hon. Members opposite on the raw because I referred to what the mart on the Clapham omnibus was thinking, not in terms of what hon. Members opposite would pay to the recipients, but in terms of what he himself would have to pay in contributions. I am quite unashamed of that intervention because I think that any man who is asked in the street whether he thinks that the old-age pensioners and other beneficiaries should have more would automatically answer "Yes". But I think we are failing in our responsibility if we do not see the other side of the coin, and ask whether he would still be as happy if we told him what he would have to pay in additional contributions or additional taxation. I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0658">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>177</span>
believe that it is important to bear in mind that there are two sides to the case—what we can pay to the beneficiaries and what we must ask the contributors to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Oldham, West was a little wide of the mark when he said that an intervention of mine was irrelevant. I seldom make irrelevant interventions, as my hon. Friends appreciate. When he mentioned that at a point in time there was always the opportunity to say that the benefits had been eroded by inflation to the point where old people were worse off than they were before the increase, I pointed out that, as a result of the annual review introduced by this Government, that is now less likely to be so. It was not irrelevant to say that. But in approaching the matter for the first time on an annual review basis, we have to ensure that we are balancing an improved standard of living for the recipients with a fair deal for the contributors. I shall concentrate the rest of my speech, which I promise, Sir Stephen, will be considerably less lengthy than others that you have heard, on that dual proposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bidwell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has posed the question of how the increases we propose are to be paid for. He has questioned the reactions of ordinary people if asked to support an increase. If one were to stop the man in the street in Billericay, might he not react by saying that he would be prepared to make a contribution himself but would expect the rich to make a much bigger contribution?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no doubt that the automatic reaction of the man in Billericay High Street, if the question were put in that way, would be much the same as that of the man in Southall High Street, which would be, "Of course, you are absolutely right". But I suggest that if we were to spell out precisely what it would mean to the man, whether he be rich or poor, his reaction would be less automatic in approving the increases these Amendments are designed to give to the recipients. The first thing we have to admit is that although the sum of 75p is bandied about in this Committee as being somehow very much below what we should be paying, it is, nevertheless, a move towards increasing the standard of living of the recipients. That is at the hub of what I shall say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is easy to dismiss a mere 75p per
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>178</span>
week. It is also easy to dismiss the fact that it will be tax-free during this financial year. But I think it is less easy to dismiss the fact that it is the second increase since June, 1970, when this Government took office. It cannot be denied that, by the autumn of this year, subject to the Bill going through unamended, there will have been an increase in cash terms in benefits of approximately one-third.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is fair for people to say, "Yes, but prices have increased dramatically during this period". I concede that prices have increased far faster than most of us would have wished or hoped. However, although prices have gone up, I challenge hon. Members opposite to say that they will have gone up by 33 per cent. between June, 1970 and the autumn of this year. I will put this in perspective. By October of this year, the pension will have gone up, under this Government, by £1.75 per week in 2¼ years, whereas in the six years of the previous Government it went up by £1.62½
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be said that I am being unfair, so let me compare what happened under the last Conservative Government and the last Labour Government. Between 1951 and 1964. the real purchasing power of the pension went up by 4 per cent. per annum compared with 2½ per cent. per anum during the period 1965 to 1970. Keeping these figures in perspective, we must also remember that, since June 1970, particularly needy sections of the community, such as the over-80s, have been given some additional assistance. Therefore, it is wise to conclude that for the first time in 20 years there will have been two increases in just over one year. This is a major achievement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should now like to turn to the question of paying for these benefits, about which remarkably little has been said so far. I do not think that we expect hon. Gentlemen opposite to give us a detailed analysis of this, but my hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Boscawen) was on the mark when he commented upon the remarkable absence from what was hardly a short speech by the hon. Member for Oldham, West of any detailed recommendations as to how the further increases proposed would be paid for, other than a few side-swipes at taxation here and contributions there. This was a remarkable omission, and I hope that hon. Members opposite will pay more attention to that aspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0659">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>179</span>
I believe that it is wise to keep a fair balance between the benefits of the recipients and the contributors. It is interesting to note that for the second time in succession the man on £18 per week or less—the poorer off member of the working community—pays nothing to achieve the desirable objective of more income for the elderly and the less fortunate. However, at the other end of the scale, the man on a maximum income of £48 per week is going to be asked to pay another 39p per week. That seems a sizeable amount, but he has been the recipient of the £1 tax relief in this year's budget, so that even after paying that 39p he is still left in possession of the greater part of what was given to him in conformity with our philosophy on incentives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I come to the conclusion that the measures outlined in the Bill are fair to the old and to the other recipients, fair to the contributor, and fair to the taxpayer. I do not honestly believe that the Amendments, which would cost a mere bagatelle of £1,200 million according to the hon. Member for Oldham, West are sufficiently important to justify their acceptance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian O'Malley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How can the hon. Gentleman suggest that the pensions which are currently payable or which will be payable as a result of the Bill are fair to the retirement pensioner when all of us—spokesmen from both parties—have admitted over the years that the pensions which we pay them are not enough to live on? Is that the hon. Gentleman's definition of fairness to a retirement pensioner?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member must be careful and reflect back on how I used the word "fair." I said that we had to see this as a balance. Of course, in an ideal world if the question of payment did not come into it we should all open our hearts and be very much more generous than the Bill aims to be. On the other hand, it is not an ideal world, we do have to ask who will pay, and I believe in the circumstances that the balance between what we are asking from the contributor and what we are paying to the beneficiary is—and I repeat the word unashamedly—as "fair" as can be devised at this particular time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The aim of the Bill is quite simply
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>180</span>
to increase the standard of living of the beneficiaries, and it is doing so, although I am the first to admit that it is doing it only marginally. I believe that we are achieving it notwithstanding the increases in prices. It is rather bogus to say that this year, because of the economic situation in which we find ourselves, it is somehow much easier to take care of matters along the lines of these Amendments than it was when the Labour Government were in office. I remind hon. Members opposite that in terms of taking additional money in the form of taxation to pay social benefits, the Labour Government were hardly backward in coming forward. I have not as yet heard any persuasive arguments why we on this side should support the Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marsden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Billericay (Mr. McCrindle) finally got round to the point of his speech. Incidentally, I should remind him that I made a small contribution on Second Reading. I I feel, however, I have more or less been seconded to this Committee, because national insurance is not at all my scene. I really only know how to tell an elector of his rights and entitlements, and to see that he gets them.

The eternal cry is, "How can we afford it?" Earlier, I recalled to the Committee the debate of 15th June, 1908.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend it again to hon. Members, because the same words have been repeated this morning. In 1908, the cry also went up about" what the country can afford". "Where is the money coming from?" is another way of saying it.

The Exchequer contribution seems to have set like concrete into our national life. Governments come and go but the Exchequer contribution is always about 18 per cent. I am asking the Minister a question which has been asked many times before. Must pensions and allowances always be primarily financed by national insurance contributions? Must the Exchequer contribution always be around 18 per cent? Very few people on either side of the House seem to apply themselves to this straightforward question. My constituents feel that pensions and allowances are a damned disgrace when the national wealth is considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>181</span>
that, at least during the early years of the national insurance scheme, the Exchequer contribution was far higher than 18 per cent. Certainly in the favourable financial circumstances in which this Government found themselves and which they are now destroying, there was no reason why the contribution could not have been put up to the higher levels of earlier years, which would have given substantial help to the section of the population in need.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marsden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for my hon. Friend's contribution. This is the way my constituents feel. I represent a rough, tough working-class constituency which thinks in a simple, straightforward manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My constituents ask me why they cannot have adequate pensions, why they always have to apply for extras like supplementary benefit and fuel allowances. They want a pension which in the first instance will be able to take care of all these things. I do not know why it cannot be done. Wealthy old age pensioners who do not need the extra money would surely have it clawed back in income tax anyway. The whole of the pension allowance system is a morass of rates. People outside get very confused. Hardly a Saturday goes by without one of my constituents coming to ask me what are his rights and how he can obtain them. He is very confused about what he is entitled to under these schemes. I repeat: why must pensions and allowances be primarily financed by national insurance contributions? It is a simple, pertinent question which needs an answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alec Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I shall comment on the speech of the hon. Member for Billericay (Mr. McCrindle). I was rather surprised by his reference to absences from the Committee. He surely knows that all members of the Committee at one time or another exercise their right to be absent because of involvement with other important duties. If he wants to make that point I draw his attention to the fact that, were it not for the attendance of hon. Members on this side of the Committee last Tuesday, there would have been no quorum and the business would have collapsed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member must take my comments in the spirit in which they were intended. I was hardly
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>182</span>
bemoaning the absence of his hon. Friends. I was merely saying that, if I were intending to refer to them, I would have preferred them to be here. As they had goaded me to contribute to the debate, I was rather sorrowful, since I had risen to their bait, that they were not here to take advantage of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Gentleman that his strictures on my remarks will be taken in the same spirit as his own on absences on this side of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that until we reach Utopia we should combine humanity and compassion with a realistic assessment of what we can afford. No one would disagree with that. What we are in fundamental disagreement on is exactly what we can afford. On this side of the Committee, we say that we can afford and should afford the upratings suggested in our Amendments. On the other hand, hon. Members opposite are apparently saying that the country can afford no more than is narrowly provided for in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman went on to say that 75p was a move forward. No one said that it was not. Sixty-five pence is a move forward. Even one penny is a move forward. But that is not the question which we should be asking. We should be asking, not whether 75p is a move forward, but whether it is a big enough move forward. I hope that, after this debate, some hon. Members opposite will concede that it is not an adequate move forward in the year 1972. I believe that the hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Boscawen) also expressed the view that we ought to be doing more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our Amendments and Schedule 1 are practically the whole Bill. If our Amendments were carried, we should be delighted because we should thereby have improved the Bill beyond recognition. The Bill and the Schedule propose to alleviate hardship and the real poverty which still exists in a considerable cross section of the people of this country. If those who attend my surgeries are typical, considerable numbers of people are living in poverty. It is our contention that the Bill does not touch sufficiently the problem of poverty. We accept that the Bill contains improvements, but we urge the Government to do more. We are saying that the Government proposals for payments to old age pensioners and others compare
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0661">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>183</span>
unfavourably with the treatment which they have meted out to other more favoured members of the community. We are saying that under Schedule 1 these improvements are too long delayed in their implementation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Presumably it is the Government's case that they are being generous to those in need and that, in any case, they cannot afford more. After this important debate it is extremely desirable to have the Government's view, which the Under-Secretary of State will give us. We know the bones of it because they are contained in the Bill. It is also essential to know the official Opposition view point, but I believe it is equally important that we have an expression of view from backbench Members on both sides of the Committee. This debate will be heard or read not only by hon. Members but will be read by many people outside, people with a particular interest in alleviating the hardship and poverty which have been described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important also that as many hon. Members as possible take part in the debate, because the people on whose behalf we are making our plea this morning are, in the main, people who have no big battalions behind them. I do not know of a national union of widows. I know that the old-age pensioners' organisations in my part of the world are particularly well organised; they are organised by their experiences in the past. But in the main, unless we, as back-bench Members, are willing to speak in criticism of our own Opposition leadership, I do not believe we are doing our best for the poor whom these Amendments are intended to help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This year of 1972 was the Government's year of opportunity. It is a year, we contend, when the Government could have granted increases at least equal to those contained in the mass of Amendments now before us. I am worried that an opportunity has been lost which may not recur for many years. Already there are ominous signs that the next Labour Government will be denied the opportunity to be as generous as this Government could have been this year. We see accelerating price increases and we read in the newspapers of balance of payments difficulties mounting. I heard on the radio last night news of a sterling crisis, and we have heard talk of a potential devaluation. If that happened, an incoming Govern-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>184</span>
ment would find it much more difficult to grant the type of increases which we believe necessary, and which the Government could and should have granted this year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Madel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman refers to opportunities for Governments to increase pensions. Does he not feel, when he talks about generosity, that the Labour Government were in a good position so to act, when the balance of payments went into surplus in late 1969 and early 1970? Does he not also feel that ability to give a pension increase depends on the economic growth rate, and the Labour Government were well placed to go for a higher rate of economic growth in the autumn of 1969?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point, and I would concede that in my view—it is a personal view, but it was shared and expressed last week by my hon. Friend the Member for Southall (Mr. Bidwell)—that many of us on the back benches of the Labour party felt that the last Labour Chancellor could have been more generous in his 1970 Budget pay-outs to such cases as old-age pensioners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bidwell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A feature of the Labour Chancellor's Budget was that it was applauded by the whole of the Conservative-orientated Press and opinion in the country. It cannot be a question of belatedly criticising him from a Tory point of view. It can only be done from a Socialist point of view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful for that intervention. I was trying to make the point that many of us wished that the Labour Chancellor had gone further in the Budget in early 1970 prior to the election, and that his failure to do so was not made easier by any pressures being put on him from the other side.

I suspect basically that the Government have missed the boat to help those seriously disadvantaged members of our community. It was almost inevitable that the boat should have been missed. Once the Chancellor had decided that this was to be a give-away Budget and that he would give away most to those who had most, it was clear that he would not have the same amount available for awarding to those in need, those people whom our Amendments are intended to help.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In his speech last week; the hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Boscawen) chided us, particularly my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Meacher), and his stricture was repeated by the hon. Member for Billericay this morning. He said that whilst we were calling for significant increases, which might be described by the other side as generous, we were failing in our duty because we did not indicate how these increases were to be paid for. I do not say it with any unpleasantness, but the hon. Member for Wells was being unfair to my hon. Friend. In 	<i>c.</i> 147 of the OFFICIAL REPORT of last Tuesday's Sitting, my hon. Friend quite clearly indicated how in his view the Amendments which he was moving could be paid for. I do not think he ducked the issue. I quote one or two points:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I face this squarely. There will be a substantial cost."</p></blockquote>
He went on to say what this would be, in his estimation:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The net cost, with tax claw back and taking a large number of people off supplementary benefit, would be £800 million to £850 million."</p></blockquote>
He continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It could have been paid for wholly out of the Exchequer this year without any increase in the insurance contribution. … But I am not suggesting it would have been paid for wholly out of the Exchequer in this year of years, but, clearly, a much increased proportion could have been paid for out of the Exchequer, in view of our priorities."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee D</i>, 20th June, 1972; 	<i>cc.</i> 147–148.]</p></blockquote>
He went on in 	<i>c.</i> 149 to indicate that there were two ways around it, one to increase the Exchequer supplement and the other, to raise the ceiling at which graduated contributions are levied. No one can suggest that my hon. Friend was dishonest in that he failed to indicate how the proposed Amendments could be financed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Boscawen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point I was making was that it would have been easier for the Government to have tested
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>186</span>
the ideas on contributions of the hon. Member for Oldham, West if he had put down the appropriate Amendments to Schedule 2. We could then have seen those ideas in black and white and would have had time to study them and see what they meant. We had so many facts and figures during the long speech of the hon. Member for Oldham, West that it was not easy to take them all in at one go.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see the force of that, but I do not believe that any Member of the Committee thinks for one moment that had we placed Amendments on the Order Paper amending the rates of contribution this would have encouraged or persuaded the Government or anyone else to have been more generous in the treatment of old-age pensioners and other claimants. If the absence of amendments to contributions is the stumbling block, let the Under-Secretary of State rise and say that he will accept our Amendments as far as the claimants are concerned and we will then reply by giving him the necessary Amendments to indicate how they should be paid [Hon. Members: "Oh"]. It is a reasonable point of view. If the hon. Gentleman the Member for Wells is suggesting that the absence of Amendments detailing how the contributions might be increased is the major stumbling block to accepting our Amendments and up-rating the pensions, the answer is quite simple: let the Under-Secretary of State say which of our Amendments he will accept and we will give him the necessary information. It is a reasonable proposition. If the hon. Gentleman will accept our Amendments dealing with unemployment and sickness benefits, we will reply accordingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But, of course, the hon. Gentleman is putting up nothing more than a smokescreen, because no matter what Amendments we put down it is extremely unlikely that the Minister will regard them at all charitably. I do not believe that we are likely to get a great deal more out of this Government than they have already put in the Bill. Nevertheless, it is essential that we make the case for those people who are in need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Returning to the speech of the hon. Gentleman the Member for Wells, I must say that I preferred his contributions recorded in 	<i>c.</i> 160 and 	<i>c.</i> 161, when he had become much more charitably
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0663">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>187</span>
minded. He was then talking in terms of supporting the ideas which are contained in these Amendments. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are not satisfied with the pension at one-fifth of national average earnings. It is not nearly enough. … I want an undertaking that will give the pensioner a higher stake in the rising standard of living annually as well as an up-rating to meet the cost of living increases."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee D</i>, 20th June, 1972; 	<i>cc.</i> 160–1.]</p></blockquote>
These are worthy aims and noble ideals on which we would willingly support the hon. Gentleman from this side of the House, but there is no Amendment which gives substance to those aims in the name of the hon. Gentleman the Member for Wells. But there is one which is fairly close to it—Amendment No. 20, which we will come to later, and which stands in the names of my hon. Friend the Member for Southall (Mr. Bidwell) and myself. If the hon. Member for Wells and other hon. Members opposite who have spoken about humanity and compassion are really concerned, I should expect that when we come to deal with that Amendment the Under-Secretary for State will be terribly embarrassed by the size of our majority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is because we agree with the point of view expressed by the hon. Member for Wells that we are proposing in this long list of Amendments the 33⅓ per cent. up-rating almost right across the board of social security benefits. In our view that up-rating will at least cover the rising cost of living and will do something towards improving the standard of living of those people who should be benefiting from the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until I came to this House I did not know much about a Clapham bus, and I had to serve on several Committees before I realised that the gentleman who travels on a Clapham bus is regarded as the average man. But the average man does not live in Rhondda, West either. I have never found him walking down my main street. However, the sort of people about whom we are talking and whom our Amendments are intended to assist are not the gentlemen who travel on Clapham buses. They are not average people; they are below average: they are the sick, the old, the unemployed, the widowed and the disabled. They are those people who are in greatest need in our community today. They are also the people who have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>188</span>
benefited least from this year's and last year's Budgets. That is why we say that an up-rating of 75p for a single person and £1.20 for a married couple is completely inadequate. We make the point again, because it is worthy of being made, that already the old age pensioners are worse off than in November, 1969. We repeat that the 75p up-rating will not meet the price increases which these people will have to face between now and November, 1973.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us put a direct question to the Under-Secretary on prices. There was considerable confusion in the House at Question Time yesterday and it was made even worse by the Minister of Agriculture's interventions regarding the cost of entry into the Common Market and its effect on price increases. Can the Under-Secretary tell the Committee what part of the 75p up-rating has been included to meet the price increases which are expected as a consequence of entering the European Economic Community?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The up-rating is also inadequate because it is far less generous to the needy members of our society—particularly if we compare them with those who live on investment income—in the amounts of money, in the extent of the up-rating and in the timing. Those in the greatest need, whom we are seeking to help by the Amendments, have to wait until November, whereas many who benefited most from the Budget had immediate benefits from 21st March. Under certain sections of the Bill, some will not receive any material benefit until December 1974. I refer to the new extension of the attendance allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last group of Amendments indicates how we propose that those in need should be dealt with. The practice of this Committee—and it will be that of every Committee dealing with pensions as long as this House lasts—is for hon. Members on both sides to indulge with great effectiveness and sometimes with great personal pleasure in the famous numbers game. One uses percentages, throws them through the window and picks up the average. Then one talks about money terms and then about real terms. At the end of the day, no one is any the wiser.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can also play the game of "Anything you can do, I can do better." Both sides have played it in turn and will continue to play it. The Opposition say that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0664">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>189</span>
they can do better than the Government. As the Under-Secretary knows, because he was an expert when he was in Opposition, the Government then make the counter-argument. This is what the Secretary of State himself said on Second Reading:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In their six years of office the Labour Government achieved a rate of growth in the buying power of the pension of only 2½ per cent. in real terms. I think it will be found that the 12½ per cent. which we are providing in October will produce a substantially greater improvement in real buying power than the annual average achievement of Labour."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 18th May, 1972; Vol. 837, 	<i>c.</i> 725.]</p></blockquote>
That is playing both games at the same time. The Secretary of State was making a wonderful selection of rates of growth, percentages, real terms and averages, and saying at the same time that he believed—his actual words were "I think"—that the Government would do better than the Opposition had done when they were the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman must know a lot more than the Secretary of State, because the Secretary of State did not say it was true—he only said "I think". The thoughts of the Secretary of State may be all-powerful to certain parts of the House but they are not to all those outside. Even if we conceded the point that the real buying power will be better under the present Government than it was under the last Government, it is not the relevant question to ask, if we are genuinely concerned with those in need. It is all right if we are only concerned as politicians with scoring points. That is fair. But it is more appropriate to a sixth form debating society. If we are talking about helping these people, it is not the relevant question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two questions on which our Amendments focus attention. First, how do those in need satisfy their daily requirements? Secondly, how does their standard of living compare with that of the rest of us? If the answer to the first is that they do not satisfy their daily requirements—and there is strong evidence that increasing numbers of the old, the sick and the long-term unemployed do not—the end product is real poverty. Comparing the standard of living of those who depend on social security with that of the working force posed by the second question, one finds glaring examples of comparative poverty. The proposals in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>190</span>
this Schedule do very little to meet real poverty. In a civilised society, real poverty should always be met. I contend also that the Schedule does nothing at all to meet comparative poverty. The gap between those on social security and those who are working is widening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Trying to make an assessment of comparative poverty with which the Bill should deal, and with which our Amendments seek to deal, we are indebted to Background Paper No. 22, dealing with social security benefits, provided by the Library of the House of Commons. The tables in the paper concerning basic retirement pensions and unemployment benefit set out the percentage of average earnings paid to those in receipt of retirement pensions and unemployment benefit for single persons and married couples. They show that over a quarter of a century the single person's payment started at 18.9 per cent. of average earnings, slumped to 15.9 per cent. in 1957, climbed to 34.2 per cent. in 1967, but in the main has hovered around 20 per cent. Similarly for the married couple the percentage started at 30.5 per cent. in 1948, dropped again to its lowest level in 1957, of 25.8 per cent., rose to its highest level in 1967 to 34.2 per cent., but in the main has hovered around 30 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this year of years, something should have been done to increase that percentage, to have lifted the 20 per cent. for the single person and the 30 per cent. for the married couple, to bring them closer to enjoying the same standard of living as those of us who have the privilege of being part of the working community. I am speaking of both sides of the House; I am not making a political point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accuse the Government of wasting the golden opportunity this year of relieving comparative poverty. In the year of the great give-away, the needy have, in the main, been forgottten.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures provided by the Library show that the average worker faces a considerable and drastic drop in his living standards when he reaches the age of retirement. Surely this ought not to be. We ought to say that a man who has worked and contributed to the wealth of society throughout his working life should have some reward, sufficient to live in comfort and dignity during his years
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0665">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>191</span>
of retirement. But those figures show that the basic rates do not enable a man to do that. I believe that our Amendments would have helped considerably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point has been and will be made that many of such people are aided by occupational pension schemes. I can only repeat the figures which were given a year or so ago. There may have been slight changes since then, but I do not suppose they are significant. We must bear in mind that occupational pension schemes do not touch so many as one would believe, and the amount of money they pay out is extremely low in many cases. In fact, the 50 per cent. of the male manual workers have no occupational pension scheme at all; 20 per cent. of the occupational pension schemes pay out less than £1 per week; and another 20 per cent. pay out less than £2 per week. For example, the mineworkers' pension scheme of £1.50 a week is not worth the paper it is written on. All it does is to exclude the miner from receiving supplementary benefit. Such schemes should not be taken into account. Only a minority of old-age pensioners can place any reliance on efficient occupational pension schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are suggesting by our Amendments that we give the old-age pensioners, and the other groups in need, a far greater uprating to help them to maintain a decent standard of living and to keep a standard of living more comparable with the rest of society. It is our contention throughout that the Government up-rating of 75p single and £1.20 for a married couple clearly fails to allow them to maintain the same position, to enjoy the same comforts, or even comparable comforts, as those which they enjoyed when they were in work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These facts are known to the Government. The Under-Secretary of State will recall that he sat this side and I sat on the back benches on the other side when we were discussing the Labour Government's National Superannuation and Social Insurance Bill. I have heard him say on many occasions that our pension schemes are completely inadequate and need recasting, and that our present pension schemes cannot solve all these problems. That is the reason why the Government have said we must have a new pension scheme, and presumably
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>192</span>
why they produced their White Paper. If the Government are so sure that the contents of their White Paper are necessary to improve the quality of living of our old ages pensioners, why did we not have a pensions Bill this year? I should have thought that if their pensions Bill is as good as they claim it will be, it would have been essential to have introduced it this year. My personal view is that it might have done more good than the Common Market legislation, or certainly the Housing Finance Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Malley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not want my hon. Friend to be unfair to the Government. They never claimed that their new pension proposals will do anything for the existing generation of retirement pensioners. They have said that they will not only continue the flat rate pension for the existing generation of retirement pensioners but that future generations of retirement pensioners will be similarly condemned to an inadequate flat rate system. My hon. Friend must not distort the policies of the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to my hon. Friend. He knows how charitably minded and well disposed I am to the Government on all occasions. I assure him that I was reserving my fire so that when we ultimately see the pensions Bill I will have by me the words of the Under-Secretary of State, which can be used on many occasions when we are dealing with that bill. I am sure my hon. Friend would want to be a member of that Committee. We need not write any speeches! They are all written for us! I shall take over the role vacated now by hon. Members opposite since they became the governing party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our Amendments, and comparing them with the Government proposals, we try to deal with the poverty which we know exists among the old age pensioners, the unemployed, the disabled, the sick, the widowed, and so on. If one asks how these people manage, the true answer is that they do not and cannot manage and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0666">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>193</span>
as a consequence a great many suffer considerable hardship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the astonishing developments in my personal life since I have been in the House is that I have now become the most experienced beggar and scrounger in the borough of Rhondda for assistance from all quarters for many people whom the Bill should help. The Supplementary Benefits Commission's officers are usually extremely helpful and if they are unable to help it is not the fault of the Commission; it is, in the main, the fault of Government decisions over a period of time. There are many aspects which urgently need to be looked at, particularly disregards and special needs and indeed, some of the levels at which people are dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real poverty in our midst is emphasised by the number of hon. Members who have to make direct appeals to nationalised industries—requesting them, for example, not to cut off the gas or electricity and to accept weekly payments for accumulated arrears of payments. I have also spent some time with voluntary groups. Only yesterday I telephoned the War Office asking for the addresses of regimental funds so that I could appeal on behalf of a one-legged ex-serviceman in my constituency who was experiencing considerable difficulty over his electricity payment. He is slightly above the supplementary level, which is why he is unable to receive help from that quarter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boscawen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not the hon. Member agree that no State scheme will ever be able to cope with all the people he has described? There are cases where people, often through their own inadequacy and misfortunes, fall through the gaps in the State schemes. It is not possible for any State scheme to cover all these people and one has to approach outside bodies such as the army benevolent funds and so on for help.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not suggesting that the State scheme can give 100 per cent. coverage, but we should endeavour now to upgrade the scheme we have to prevent the numerous applications one has to make on behalf of these people. The present level of payment is too low and if it was somewhat higher, the ex-serviceman to whom I referred would not have needed my help and would have been able to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>194</span>
meet his payments from his weekly income.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point made by the hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Boscawen) is well known—that feckless and inadequate management is the basic cause of poverty in a significant number of cases and that any State scheme will be inadequate. The evidence, such as we have, on what is essentially an emotive subject indicates that this is quite wrong. The Circumstances of Families Report of 1967 examined the number of working families whose total weekly income was beneath the supplementary benefit line, even after a full week's work. There were 160,000 such families with 250,000 children. It was found that, contrary to the general view of either work-shyness or an excessive number of children being the cause of their poverty, two-thirds had a normal size family of only two or three children and one one-sixth had five or more children. With regard to hours of work, it was found that rather than working fewer hours than the rest of the population, they had actually worked marginally longer hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So let us hear no more in this Committee about fecklessness or mismanagement or incapacity to use resources in a profitable and proper—which generally means middle-class—manner as being a cause of poverty. It is nothing of the sort. It is the inadequacy of State schemes, whether for retirement pension, unemployment or sickness benefit, or the level of wages plus the existence of the wage-stop, which are the fundamental causes of poverty in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boscawen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But the hon. Gentleman should give us credit for recognising this. We do not disagree. With the family income supplement we have recognised that there are still many gaps in the present State arrangements. But the State will never be able to cover all the cases he was mentioning where the pension does not cover some of the disasters that hanpen to people, whether by their own fecklessness or for other reasons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for those interventions; they gave me time to draw breath. My hon. Friend made an important point. My point is that the number of claims and appeals which I have

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>195</span>
to make to many and various quarters in order to get help for people in need indicates to me the extent of the real poverty which our national scheme is not covering and which our up-ratings as recommended in these Amendments would considerably help. If our Amendments were accepted, I should not need to be chasing the Green Howards or other regimental funds. We should have taken over our fair responsibility as a State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have failed to meet the real poverty which I see in my part of the world. They must be aware of this. All of us, as Members of Parliament, have contact with constituents. Most hon. Members opposite have surgeries where they meet the old and the sick, and they must find many examples showing how our present levels of social security payments are inadequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For many of these people, the price of food presents one of the greatest hardships. They have to be so selective that their food becomes almost distasteful. We have had all sorts of comments on food prices given by the present Government. The Minister of Agriculture suggested that, if the price of apples was too high, we should try peaches, and when beef went up, we should try poultry. Presumably, when bread goes up we shall have to try toast. That sort of comment does not help these people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our experience as Members of Parliament indicates to us that there is poverty in our society. If we doubt it, the statistics tell us. The retail price index rose 21.9 points in the 22 months, from June 1970 to April 1972. But even the retail price index is not necessarily a true reflection of the poverty among old people, the unemployed or the sick. It covers many items which such people would not normally include in their weekly shopping.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the best measure of real poverty is the food price index. In answer to a Question, we were told that the food price index since June 1970 has risen by 17.4 per cent. The people we are talking about, the old-age pensioners, do not eat percentages. Talk of 17.4 per cent. to the majority of the old-age pensioners in our constituencies would not convey anything. They are more concerned with the daily costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is why I believe that the 	<i>Daily Mirror</i> performs a valuable service to us
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>196</span>
as Members of Parliament in focusing our attention week in and week out on the rise in prices. It puts it in picturesque 	<i>Mirror</i> language, but it does us good sometimes as legislators to be reminded that it is not percentages or averages but the actual prices that are important. The week when the Bill had its Second Reading, the "Mirror Shopping Clock" of May 13th had the headline "What a Shocker!" and the article said,
	<br><blockquote><p>"A real shocker—that's this weekend's food bill. It sent the hands of the Mirror Shopping Clock swinging forward by 12½p."</p></blockquote>
Then it said that, if it was any consolation to those who were having difficulty, for a good bargain they could buy 12 red Oxo cubes and save 2½p.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 20th May, again, the Mirror Shopping Clock had headlines, "Top Price!", and the Shopping Clock hit the highest ever. Again we were warned of an increase, only to find that the bargain offer of the 12 red Oxo cubes of the week before had now been taken away. If the old-age pensioner wanted to save money that week, he could drop the Oxo cubes and buy 12 fish fingers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The following week, on 27th May,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Zoom! It's the highest ever"</p></blockquote>
said the Mirror Shopping Clock. Again, it warned us that last week's offer of the fish fingers had now been taken away. The following week, 7th June, the headline was,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Just a tanner from the Top ",</p></blockquote>
indicated that the Clock had now almost reached the limit of its capacity to measure. On 10th June, the Clock had to be regraduated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am using those extracts from the 	<i>Daily Mirror</i> to show the extent of the price rises which many unemployed and sick people have to face, in substantiation of our argument that they are entitled to a far larger increase than the Bill proposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 10th June, we saw how prices had soared in 19 months. I take 17th June now, not because it suits my political argument but because I am an honest gentleman by birth. On 17th June, the Clock indicated that the price had dropped. That must give some comfort to the Government, but it said "Down, but …", and the "but" indicated that if our old-age pensioners, the unemployed and the sick wanted to benefit from the decrease that week they would have to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0668">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>197</span>
buy a 3-lb. bag of plain flour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Week in and week out, our old people in need are facing price rises in essential goods and foods which they have to buy if they are to maintain themselves at a decent standard of living. Lest we fall for the argument which is being put forward, that the severe escalation of prices is now being brought under control, I remind hon. Members of the report in the 	<i>Daily Telegraph</i>, 20th June, where the headline was,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Rising Prices may endanger Market".</p></blockquote>
This was a report to the Treasury officials of Britain and the Six in Luxembourg. It indicates that there is no unanimity of view that price rises are being controlled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now we come to the question whether we can afford the cost of our Amendments. We are not talking about 1948, in the post-war period, and we are not talking about 1964, when the balance of payments was the problem. We are talking about 1972, when the economic background has enabled the Chancellor to boast of his ability to distribute some £3,000 million in tax relief in his Budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can we afford it? Looking at the giveaway in the Budget, we think that that money could have been better used to relieve poverty, and to accept the purpose of our Amendments. Here are just two examples from the Budget. The relief on estate duty cost the Exchequer £128 million in a full year, and that relief was to be effective from 21st March; it did not have to wait until November. Second, there was the investment income surcharge, to cost the Exchequer some £300 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come back to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Southall with which I completely agree, that if it was felt desirable to uprate these benefits as we suggest, and if the Government were to tell the people that it was necessary to increase their contributions in order to pay a decent pension to the old people and others in need, the people would be willing to do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our Amendments relate in the main the basic cash rates of benefits. It has been said that there are other benefits for the old and the sick, benefits in kind, concessionary fares and benefits other allowances. These additional topping-up benefits are not available to everybody, but, even if they were, they are only additions, and it is essential to deal first with
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>198</span>
the basic rates upon which so many people are forced to depend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State, on Tuesday, 13th June, talked about the best use of available resources and he referred to the age of onset. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… the age of onset was the right approach given the limited resources available."</p></blockquote>
Further on in the same speech, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… on the basis of likely resources …"—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee D</i>, 13th June, 1972; 	<i>c.</i> 75.]</p></blockquote>
Throughout, we have the suggestion—it was repeated this morning—that it is a question of the availability of resources. I do not suggest that the Government should have made better use of the resources which they have made available in the Bill. We say that extra resources should have been made available: not sharing the same money out in a different way, but putting more money into the upratings so as to meet the need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not challenge the wisdom of the Under-Secretary and the Department in the allocation within the global sum. We challenge the Government's whole policy and sense of priorities. We have put down a large number of Amendments, but no one can describe them as over-generous. For instance, Amendment No. 26 deals with the increase of unemployment and sickness benefit for first qualifying child. The present rate is £1.85 per week. The Bill proposes £2.10 per week, an increase of 25p per child. No one could regard that as generous. I do not think that anyone could say that it was reasonable. It is in no way adequate. In fact, 25p would hardly cover the increases which the Government have deliberately imposed on children who attend school through increases in the charge for school meals and the decision to abolish free school milk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment would move from the present rate of £1.85 to £2.47, an increase of 62p. I believe that to be necessary, and not extravagant, and I think that that is a fair description of all the Opposition Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last year, the Under-Secretary spoke on the National Insurance Bill and he performed a balancing act between what he called "pension logic" and humanity. For greater accuracy, I have obtained a copy of his speech. We were discussing the over-80s pension and he said:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0669">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>199</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is probably a good guide that when pension logic appears to point firmly in one direction and humanity points firmly in the other, we should back humanity."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee G</i>, 20th May, 1971; 	<i>c</i>. 132.]</p></blockquote>
No one on either side will quarrel with the Under-Secretary in using those words. We are pleading that the Government have the same humanity this time. Humanity demands greater justice to those whom our Amendments are intended to help—the sick, the unemployed, the widowed, the disabled and so on, whose need cannot be denied. The only thing in doubt is the political will to bring about the means to satisfy that need. We seek to ensure that that obvious need is met, and that it is met this year, because it is easier to meet it this year than it has been for many years past and than it will be probably for some years in the future. The tragedy is that the Government are missing the boat on this occasion, and it may take years before we can catch up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Madel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Rhonnda, West (Mr. Alec Jones) said that various sections of the country were listening to this debate and following it closely to see what plans and ideas we have to meet the real need to raise the living standards of old-age pensioners. The hon. Member for Liverpool, Scotland (Mr. Marsden) said that the Exchequer contribution should be re-examined. I hope that the Minister will take up those points, because it causes great dismay when an announcement of a pension increase is made and it is some time before that increase takes effect. Could my hon. Friend tell us whether, if the Exchequer contribution were increased, the delay between announcement and implementation could be shortened. In six or seven months, all sorts of economic factors can intervene, not least factors overseas over which this country has not necessarily full control, which can make a difference to the living standards of pensioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister can help with another question. We said during the General Election campaign that the effects of going into Europe could be unfortunate to begin with on various sections of the community, and that the Government would have pensions and other welfare benefits under constant review
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>200</span>
once we joined the Community and that, should it be necessary, due to economic facts in Europe over which we do not have complete control, to increase pensions in six or seven months after they go up in November, the Government would not hesitate to take that action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Liverpool, Scotland talked about the national cake and how it is cut up. The central problem is that the national cake is not big enough. No Government until this Government have committed themselves to full economic growth. The Chancellor said in his Budget speech that, if the choice was between distorting the domestic economy and adjusting the value of the currency, he would adjust the value of the currency rather than go in for a freeze and squeeze, which bears heavily on old-age pensioners, as it does on the rest of the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Birmingham, Stechford (Mr. Roy Jenkins) had three Budgets when the balance of payments was going into surplus, in 1968, 1969 and 1970. Not once do I recall having read that he said that, should the situation arise again when it was necessary to make a choice between distorting the domestic economy and adjusting the exchange rate, he would adjust the exchange rate. Therefore, although it is true that many hon. Members opposite are committed to full economic growth and argued strongly during the period of the Labour Government that there should be full economic growth, they have not been the majority. They may be the majority now, but they were not the majority between 1966 and 1970. If they had been, we would have gone for a faster rate of economic growth than we had in those four years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Boscawen) rightly paid attention in the last part of his speech to the need to be constantly vigilant to increase the standard of living of old-age pensioners, the unemployed and the sick. That brings us to the central issue: the value of the pension depends on having a voluntary incomes policy and agreement between Government, TUC and CBI on the level of wages that should be paid. We should then get away from the fearful industrial collisions that we have had in the past two years, and from the threat of them. A shortage of goods because of a dock strike or a slow-down in coal production
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0670">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>201</span>
affect old people who cannot look after themselves much more than they do other sections of the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To deal with poverty in a mixed economy, to which we are all committed, we must work much harder towards a voluntary incomes policy. On an incomes board, whatever it may be, there must be someone who really understands the needs of pensioners and can put their viewpoint when wage and salary negotiations are going on. That is the way to increase the value of the pension—to go for economic growth. I look forward to the day when all hon. Members opposite will have changed their view since 1966-70 and agree with the Chancellor of the Exchequer that, if the choice is between distorting the domestic demand and adjusting the exchange rate, we should go for rapid economic growth.

The constituency of the hon. Member for Liverpool, Scotland depends on full production in the car factories which have gone there as the result of successive postwar Governments policies in getting industry into development areas. If there are any more freezes or squeezes, or under-use of capacity, if motor car factories are running at 60 or 70 per cent., the very poverty which the hon. Member is fighting against will come back to the area—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

will endeavour to catch your eye, Sir Stephen. I merely thought that, at this point, it would be helpful to the Committee, as a large number of points have been raised, if I were to deal with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I start with some of the points which were put, what now seems an age ago, by the hon. Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Meacher), when, in a long speech, he introduced the Amendments. He made some point on the level of the pension now. It is only right that I should correct the record and show the Committee where he went wrong in his analysis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise—this point has been made by the hon. Member for Rhondda, West (Mr. Alec Jones) today and by the hon. Member for Southall (Mr. Bidwell)—that we are most concerned with, as the really constructive part of the debate, is whether the benefits proposed in the Clause and the Schedule are adequate, and, if not, how any additional benefits should be paid for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened, and so has the Committee, very patiently to the hon. Gentleman for well over an hour and a half—[Hon. Members: "Two and a quarter hours".] Two and a quarter hours. It would probably be for the convenience of the Committee if I were able, at least, to start my speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ought, at the beginning, to deal with the analysis which he made and, in particular, with the incorrect points of his analysis, so that the record may be put straight. I am sure that, whatever arguments we may have, the Committee would not wish them to be based on false analysis and incorrect facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the beginning, the hon. Member for Oldham, West tried to make the point that the pension has fallen in value since 1969. In an effort to sustain that argument, he did not compare like with like. He took the pension in November, 1969, when it had just been increased, in other words, when it was at a maximum, and compared it with what he thought the pension would be in October, 1972, just before the increase, in other words, when it was a a minimum. He compared the peak with the trough. My hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Boscawen) interrupted him to point out that he was not comparing like with like—that, instead of giving the figure of £5 which was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0671">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>203</span>
the figure in November, 1969, he should have given the figure for October, 1969. My hon. Friend challenged him to give it. He did not give it; he was not able to. Had he done so, it would have destroyed his argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will now give the Committee the figure. The figure which the hon. Gentleman should have given was £4.04. In other words, he was comparing that with his suggested figure of £4.70 or £4.80. It completely destroys his argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me put it another way. The fairest comparison that one can make is to take the real value of the pension six months after upratings. I start with the good, substantial Labour Government up-rating in 1965. One starts from that baseline, when the pension was £4. Six months afterwards, in September 1965, the real value was £3.89. Six months after the 1967 uprating, the real value was £3.96, a modest improvement which I willingly concede. Six months after the November 1969 uprating, the real value was £3.94. It had dropped slightly because that was the bad Labour uprating which did not quite restore the purchasing power of the pension. Six months after the September 1971 uprating, the real value was £4.11. That, I suggest, is the most accurate way to reach a proper assessment. It shows, broadly speaking, a gradual improvement in the real value of all upratings apart from 1969.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Oldham, West, when he had been caught out by my hon. Friend, rather shifted his ground. His next argument was that pensions have only kept level with prices. This is not true either. Whether one takes the Conservative or the Labour Government's records, that is not borne out. Taking the period between June 1970 and September 1971, the pension was increased by 20 per cent. while prices went up 11.2 per cent. By October 1972 the pension will have been increased by 35 per cent. I am not prepared to speculate on the increase in prices but it will be way below that. I say that with confidence because in the first five months of 1972 prices have risen less than in any year since 1967. That disposes of the hon. Gentleman's second argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the hon. Gentleman realised he was on slippery ground in that case, he
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>204</span>
shifted to a comparison with earnings. Even here he was wrong. I should like to give the Committee a figure which clearly represents what has happened. If one takes 1950—I gave this information in answer to a Question which appeared in the OFFICIAL REPORT, 16th June—as a base line of 100 for pensions, earnings and retail prices, the pension at the single rate now stands at 461.5 and much the same figures apply to a married couple; the rise in retail prices is 256.0; the rise in average earnings is 438.5. Under both Governments, the rise in pensions has been infinitely more than the rise in prices and slightly more than the increase in average earnings. I am not making a political point here. It has happened under both Governments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When my hon. Friend was referring to inflation up to November 1973 he would not attempt to predict, but would he not agree that the predictions made by the hon. Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Meacher), were totally unrealistic? The Review of the National Institute predicted a rate of inflation of 7 per cent; whereas the hon. Member for Oldham, West's calculations were based upon an assumed rate of inflation in excess of 10 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree. There is a great deal in what my hon. Friend says.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman when I have completed this part of my argument. We all listened to him very patiently for a great deal of time and I can assure the Committee I shall not talk for anything like the same time. I hope I have demolished the intellectually disreputable argument which the hon. Gentleman for Oldham, West used. It does not help an informed quiet debate on pensions to produce figures which the hon. Gentleman, with his understanding of the subject, should realise are wrong. I hope he is now ashamed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next batch of arguments the hon. Gentleman used concerned the erosion of the value of the pension between upratings. I concede that he admitted that this happens inevitably between any up-rating whatever its level, and it is perfectly true. It is the inevitable process of inflation eating into the value of the pension as months go by. It has happened under all Governments. Two figures help
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0672">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>205</span>
to put the argument into perspective. In the seven months September 1971 to April 1972, the fall in the purchasing power of the pension was 3.9 per cent. In the seven months after the last Labour uprating, in 1969, the fall in the purchasing power was 4.6 per cent. It was a greater fall but on that occasion it was well over a year before the next uprating. On this occasion, there are only four months to go before the situation is put right. The Committee should recognise that one of the best ways of dealing with the erosion of pensions because of rising prices is to review the pension as frequently as possible. This is the major significance of the annual review which we have introduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's anxiety to refute my arguments has rather run away with the quality of some of his points. He said that the impression I gave about the changing value of the pension, taking into account inflation, was false because I was not comparing like with like. I submit that he is merely taking a different launching point from mine. It is really an arbitrary matter as to which point one takes. When he gives the figure of £4.04 as the value of the pension immediately prior to the November 1969 rise, it is presumably based on the value of the pension at the previous increase deflated during the time span up to the next review point. I accept that this is one way of looking at it but it seems entirely arbitrary to choose that particular point—the previous uprating as opposed to November 1969—as the point from which one calculates. There seems no justification necessarily for choosing that point as opposed to another—for example going back to November 1967 as opposed to November 1969.

The second point—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We cannot have another speech. Interventions are meant to be interventions and should be brief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman and I will be brief about the other points he raised. I did not say that the pension had not kept up with prices. The hon. Gentleman said that I said that, but I did not. I said that since November 1969 prices have risen by 22 per cent. and the pension has risen by only 20 per cent. So pensioners are worse off today than in November 1969 and they will
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>206</span>
remain so for the next three months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister ought now to resume his speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is missing the point. The point I made about the comparison is that if one is to get a fair comparison one must take the same point in the cycle. What the hon. Gentleman did in the beginning—though admittedly he rather wrote off that point later, since he could see it was not a good one—was to take a point at the peak of one cycle and at the trough of another. That is the arbitrariness and the unfairness of his comparison.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Barbara Castle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I take up the point that the Under-Secretary made about the erosion of value between up-ratings, when he gave two periods? Does not what he said prove what my hon. Friend was saying about the arbitrariness of this selection of figures? He admits that in 1965 the Labour Government gave a generous uprating, at 18½ per cent. This followed a period of 22 months in which the cost of living had risen by only 5.8 per cent., whereas last year the 20 per cent. increase of the Conservative Government after 22 months was in response to a period when the cost of living had gone up by 16.5 per cent. There is a very different rate of erosion in those two cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point I am making is that if one takes any individual uprating, one will get a different level of erosion before the next uprating, depending upon how high the uprating was and what happened to prices between that uprating and the next upratng. There are some occasions where one can point to a good uprating for a period. The Labour up-rating of 1965 is a good example. The Conservative uprating of 1955 is another. In order to get a fair comparison, I am takng a perod six months after upratings and trying to give the real value then. I gave the fuller figures since 1950 which showed, broadly speaking, though some were better than others, a gradual but modest improvement in the real value of the pension.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But is the hon. Gentleman comparing like with like in the figures he has just given for the erosion of value between upratings? He spoke of the six
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0673">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>207</span>
months after September 1971 when admittedly the Conservative uprating was 20 per cent., and compared this with the six months followng the Labour Government's increase in 1969, which we in the Committee have admitted was an unsatisfactory uprating. Certainly it was unsatisfactory compared with our 1965 uprating. The reason was the difference in the economic difficulties which the Government faced. Is not part of our whole case that the current economic situation must be taken into account? We are discussing this uprating in the context of a reflationary and not deflationary Budget.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One would get exactly the same picture if one started from the 1965 uprating. It is for that reason that I gave all the figures since 1950, to try to put the matter fully into perspective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to some of the other individual points raised before coming to what is really the heart of this debate, namely, the paucity of the arguments put forward by the Opposition as to how their proposals are to be paid for. The hon. Member for Oldham, West and the hon. Member for Southall (Mr. Bidwell) mentioned the level of the supplementary benefits. They pointed out the gap between the supplementary benefit level and the pension level, broadly speaking a gap of about £2 if one takes into account rent and rates, the supplementary benefit level being about £2 above the national insurance pension level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Southall made the point that there are still people who are reluctant to claim supplementary benefit. I accept that there are still such people, but I hope he will agree that one of the good things which the Labour Government did was when they changed the name on the door to "The Supplementary Benefits Commission". They emphasised at that time, with full support from us, that supplementary benefit is there as of right for anyone entitled to it. As a result of the campaign which was then conducted, the Labour Government, quite properly, presided over a substantial increase in the number of people who became eligible and who claimed supplementary benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is that the only way one
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>208</span>
can effectively take people off supplementary benefits under the present arrangements is to hold the level of supplementary benefit down. I do not believe for one moment that that is what the Opposition are suggesting. The most helpful way in the long term to get people off supplementary benefit is the tax credit system. My hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Boscawen) mentioned this. This is looking into the future certainly, but at the present moment the only way in which one can reduce the number of people who are being helped by the supplementary benefits scheme is to hold the level down and to have the gap between the supplementary benefit and the national insurance pension wider than it is now. I ask hon. Gentlemen to accept that this is the dilemma. If they say to me that there ought to be fewer people on supplementary benefit, they are inevitably asking me to hold down the level of supplementary benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what it amounts to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bidwell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In this matter of people's right to supplementary benefit, will not the hon. Gentleman agree that what proud people detest is that they know that before they can get it they must disclose means? Although both Governments have been on the generous side on this matter in the sense that they disregard a certain amount of savings and have uprated that disregard, nevertheless one must put oneself in the shoes of the old people. They will fight against having to disclose means even at the price of losing supplementary benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that a scheme which tries to meet individual needs in the way in which we have met it for many years means an assessment of what those needs are. In order, to assess those needs accurately, one must inquire into the means of individuals. I accept that this is the inevitable position. Having done that, one is then able to help a whole series of people, to raise their standard of living, because they then become eligible for the receipt of benefit and, having become eligible, the number of inquiries from then on is minimal. If their income does not change, no further inquiries are required at all. The chances are that the level of their benefit will be increased
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0674">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>209</span>
rather than decreased, as their rents rise and as upratings give them a higher level of benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the tax credit arrangement will radically alter their position. I must not go into details about a green paper which is not even yet published, but there is no doubt at all that this is the most hopeful suggestion that any Government has made since the war to deal with the problem that the hon. Member for Southall has just mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important point about supplementary benefit. The hon. Gentleman will forgive me if I say that we cannot accept his word about the nature of the tax credit scheme, because we have not seen it. We are dealing with the present situation. In the present situation we know that hundreds of thousands of pensioners are not claiming supplementary benefit even though they are entitled to it. If therefore, the level of the basic single pension were to be lifted to £8 as we suggest, there would be included thousands of pensioners who would otherwise have £2 less.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, I do not think that the right hon. Lady is accurate in saying that there are hundreds of thousands of people eligible for supplementary benefit who are not claiming it. A survey on the "Financial Circumstances of Retirement Pensioners" was published in 1966, which showed that an estimated 700,000, or slightly more, were entitled to national assistance, as it then was, but were not claiming it. In 410,000 of these households, the gap between their resources or other adults in the household. Of the remaining 300,000 or so, the gap between resources and requirements was less than 5s. in 40,000 cases. Only between a quarter and a third of those interviewed gave pride or reluctance to accept charity as a reason for not seeking assistance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those figures come from a survey made in 1966, before the successful campaign, conducted by the then Government, to persuade people to claim. Although there are no up-to-date figures which I can give the Committee, because we have not had a similar survey, I think there is no doubt that the number entitled who are not claiming is substantially less than the figure I have just given for 1966.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How do we know that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>210</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because of the success of the then Government's campaign to persuade people. I cannot be dogmatic about it, but, in the light of the breakdown of the figures that I have already given, it is not accurate to say that there are hundreds of thousands—it was not even accurate in 1966—and it is much less likely that it is accurate today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman accept a brief intervention on that point? The reason for the figure almost certainly not having gone down is that two-thirds of the increase in take-up was due to the then Government's raising the levels of eligibility. Only about a third of the increase in take-up at that time was of people who were previously eligible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the hon. Gentleman accept also that all those 850,000 people were entitled to claim, despite the impression he has been giving, and were not claiming, and the number today is unlikely to be less than 750,000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is speculating, as he often does.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not speculation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I am saying is that it is almost certainly an exaggeration to say that there are hundreds of thousands of people who are eligible today and who are not claiming. We are extremely anxious that everybody who is eligible for this benefit should claim, and I know that I can rely on the assistance of both sides of the Committee in bringing these benefits to the attention of any constituent who they think is entitled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the questions put by my hon. Friend the Member for Bedfordshire, South (Mr. Madel) as to the timing of the increase. He will forgive me if I am brief on this, because we shall be debating this later. Now that we have an annual increase in pensions, we have to ask ourselves what is the best time of year to do it. This short answer, in our judgment, is that it is the onset of the winter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend asked, as did the hon. Member for Rhondda, West, about the cost of EEC entry. I remind the Committee that the Government have given a firm commitment that any increases in food or other prices which may take place as a result of our entry into the EEC will be fully taken into account, and pensioners will be fully compensated in upratings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0675">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>211</span>
The uprating to come into operation in October will provide a real improvement in the value of the pension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the main argument which should concern us, namely, the cost of the Opposition's proposals, and how it should be met. Perhaps I may deal, first, with a fringe argument which has been put by hon. Members opposite, the comparison between the £1 off the income tax and the 75p on the pension. It is not a valid comparison to make. In one case, we are leaving a little more of people's money in their pockets, rather than have the Chancellor raid it, and in the other we are dealing with cash benefits which have to be paid for by the contributions of those who are in insurance, and by the taxpayer. I do not accept the logic of that argument. The logic of it is that one does not reduce taxation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is understandable from the Opposition; they are the party of high taxation. But one of the troubles with high taxation is the social damage which it does, and the inability to maintain the rate of growth and, therefore, to pay for the increase in pensions, which it causes, which my hon. Friend the Member for Wells mentioned in his last speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The harsh reality is that the high levels of taxation introduced by the previous Government, with the lower levels of taxation abolished and the tax threshold brought down, made it immensely more difficult to pursue an effective social policy to help those most in need. One of the valuable effects of this Budget, which is taking less taxation, is that no fewer than 2¾ million people can be taken out of taxation altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not, therefore, accept the logic of the comparison. But, even if one did accept it, one ought not to compare the £1 off tax with the 75p as though that were the correct comparison for everybody. As my hon. Friend the Member for Wells pointed out, of the £1 off tax for earning families some will be paid back in increased contributions to pay for the increase in pensions. Also, for a married couple, the pension increase will be not 75p but £1.20. Those who are paying tax will have the benefit of the tax relief as well. So even on the basis of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>212</span>
arguments used, I do not accept that the comparison is valid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the cost of the Amendments. The hon. Member for Rhondda, West did his best. He said, "Accept one or two, and we will put down the appropriate Amendments to Schedule 2 to pay for them".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Generous offer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect to the hon. Gentleman, I should have found that argument much more convincing if the Amendments had been there already, so that we could judge. I should, equally, find it much more convincing if the Opposition on the Finance Bill Committee had had their Amendments at the ready to withdraw some of the tax reliefs which had been provided in the Budget. Until they do that, they will forgive us if we take their suggestions with a pinch of salt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall develop this, so perhaps the hon. Gentleman will allow me. I have not finished with him yet, I assure him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The extra cost of the Opposition Amendments, over and above what is in the Bill, would be about £700 million. If it were to apply to all the benefits, supplementary benefit, more pensions and the like, it would go up to something like £800 million. That is on top of the £500 million, roughly, which is the cost of the improvements in the uprating this year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that gross or net?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am giving the gross figure. Net it would be slightly less, because the £700 million figure excludes supplementary benefits, which presumably, the Opposition want to increase—it is not in order on the Bill, and I understand their reasons—and also things like family income supplement, war pensions and other matters which are not in the Bill. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I shall not argue about the figure. It is of the order of £700 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it were met in what has now become the normal way through contributions and the Exchequer supplement of 18 per cent., the additional contributions which would be required would be as follows: for the man earning £29 a week, 4p; the £30 a week man, 27p; the £40 a week
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0676">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>213</span>
man, 49p; and the £48 a week man, 67p. That is, in effect, what the Opposition are asking. They are asking for those increases in contributions if it is to be met in the way it has been recently by both Labour and Conservative Governments. The total increase in the contributions on individuals would amount, at the ceiling—the £48 a week man—to £1.06. Over and above that there would be somewhat similar inoreases from the employer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Southall (Mr. Bidwell) said that working people—I include all of us who are working people—would not be averse to paying increased contributions. I suggest that those arguments, coming from him, would be more convincing if he had said that he would now talk to the trade union leaders and put to them that, if working people accepted the increase in contributions, they should not immediately try to claw it back in wage increases. If that happens, invariably there is another round of inflation and pensioners are no better off in the end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Billericay (Mr. McCrindle) was absolutely right when he said that it was easy to make proposals but one must combine humanity and compassion with a real assessment of what can be afforded and what the effect of increases of that kind would be on individual contributors and taxpayers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition have said that the Exechequer contribution should be higher, and that this would keep down the amount of additional money which has to be found by the contributor. This is an arguable point. They have suggested also that the contribution should go up to 25 per cent. On that basis, it would mean an addition to the Exchequer contribution of about £340 million. To pay for that, the standard rate of income tax would have to go up to almost 41 per cent.—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I finish, and then give way to the right hon. Lady? I am sure she would prefer to hear the 'whole of my argument. The standard rate of income tax would have to go up to almost 41 per cent., and that would reduce the £1 cut in income tax to 70p. Furthermore, it would bring back into taxation 750,000 people who have now been taken out of taxation by the Budget.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>214</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rubbish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would be one of the effects of doing it the Opposition's way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it will be helpful if I am allowed to finish this part of my argument. In addition to that, there would still be a substantial increase in contributions required. In this case, they would amount to 2p for the £20 a week man, 14p for the £30 a week man, 17p for the £40 a week man and 37p for the £48 a week man. Therefore, even on the basis of the Exchequer contribution going up to 25 per cent., a substantial increase in contributions would still be required from those earning £18 or more a week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be happy to deal in fuller detail with these points when I reply to the hon. Gentleman. But I must at this stage nail the lie that our proposals must mean, and would mean, an increase for everyone in the way suggested. One example of an alternative way of raising £300 million would be to exclude the benefit to people living on investment income.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Lady may argue as she will about the way in which the money has to be found. What she cannot gainsay is that, if the additional money is to be found, somebody whom my right hon. Friend proposes to relieve of a burden will find that relief withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly. I have given an example.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Equally, over and above that, a substantial increase in contribution on the individual—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, there is—will be required if this sum is to be found. That, therefore, is the argument against changing the Exchequer contribution from what is proposed in the Bill, and from what was proposed also by the previous Government when they had responsibility for these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An additional argument, which supports my case, is that in both last year's and this year's uprating the man earning £18 a week or less is paying no increase whatsoever. All the increase is being borne by those who earn more than that,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0677">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>215</span>
which seems to us a much fairer way of distributing the cost than was the case with the Opposition. Their three uprating invariably increased the flat rate of contribution as well as the earnings-related. We have deliberately avoided doing that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are committed to an annual pension review. We have already increased the pension in two upratings by £1.75 for a single person—and, quite rightly, since the cost of living has risen—and we are committed to providing not only price protection but a better pension if we possibly can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Wells made that point when he said what we wanted to see was a rise in the standard of living of pensioners, not just the protection of purchasing power. There was a modest rise in the standard of living as a result of the improvement last year; there will be a slightly bigger rise as a result of the improvement this year. And the annual review, when we look at these things every year rather than every second year, will make it easier to move towards the target which my hon. Friends have, quite rightly, urged upon the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, there has been the selective improvements which were made last year for the over-80s, for young widows and for the chronic sick, and the attendance allowance for the disabled, which is being extended. There are also the substantial additional sums of money which are being made available for health, welfare and care services, and for the elderly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I submit that, in the light of what has been done and of what the Opposition are proposing, we have the balance right between improving the lot of the pensioner, on the one hand, and taking into account the additional cost, however it may be borne by the working population, on the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the most significant features of the debate has been the coyness of the Opposition in stating precisely how the cost should be met. The hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton), who is an old hand at the game, had a good word for it when he talked about political auctioneering. That is, in effect, what we are dealing with in the Amendment, and I invite the Committee to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>216</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has not exactly been at the top of his form in answering the debate. I want to deal head-on with some of his arguments for rejecting the Amendments. He has given a lot of figures. I am sure that the old people will read them with complete indifference and incomprehension. We are all getting letters from the old age pensioners, not spelling out by how many new pence or old pence in real terms they are better off than they were in 1965 or 1969. They are concerned with how to make ends meet. There are differences of opinion on either side as to how to deal with the problem, but I hope that we all agree on the aim—to increase their real standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not only done by cash, as the Minister rightly said. Inevitably, in the Bill, we are dealing with cash payments. But the problems of the old, the sick and the unemployed must be measured by more than that. The Minister was less than fair to my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Meacher). My hon. Friend is not dishonest. He takes a great interest in these problems and he sought to compare like with like.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Mervyn Pike</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Carefully selected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has not been unknown for the Tory Party in opposition to select statistics to prove its case. We have all done it. We can all make statistics lie to suit our purposes, but this contributes nothing towards solving the problem. When the Minister talks about the uprating in 1965 and how six months afterwards it had been eroded, and compares that with 1967, 1969 and 1971, his figures make no contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I made my first speech in the Committee, I made two basic points: first, that we should inevitably be accused of political auctioneering—this is in the nature of debates on these Bills—and, secondly, that I did not want to be accused of filibustering. I had no intention of filibustering and nor could my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West be accused of that. It is true that he made a long speech but, if one considers the millions of people who are depending on what we decide for good or ill, it is not unreasonable to expect long and passionate speeches, although the Minister may make charges of dishonesty and lack of integrity, and the other charges that he made against my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I took down the Minister's words. He said my hon. Friend was using "intellectually disreputable arguments." I am not here to defend my hon. Friend but in his absence I must. I take the view that the comment made by the Minister on my hon. Friend's speech was frankly not worthy of him.

I turn now to the second point that the Minister made about the erosion of the value of pensions between upratings. Of course that is inevitable: that is why even the trades unions are talking about threshold agreements to take account of this and to prevent it from happening. If the trades unions want an agreement to foresee and forestall possible increases in the cost of living, we ought not to be surprised if the old age pensioners want no less generous treatment. The case might not be sustained by facts that the Minister has at his disposal, but the pensioners believe that, come October or whenever the 75p will be payable, they will not be very much better off than they have been over the past years under both Governments. It is no good talking about the erosion being less. I think he said that the figure from September 1971, to April 1972 was a 3.9 per cent. erosion as compared with the 4.6 per cent. erosion in the six months after the 1969 increase. He went on to say that the difference was that now they had only got four months to go before they get the next increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have made great play of an annual, as against a biennial, up-rating, but that does not necessarily mean that the old age pensioners will be better off. If the rate of inflation doubles in the annual reviews, as compared with the increase in inflation when there was a biennial increase, we will be back to where we were. We must link the rate of inflation with the regularity of the review. If inflation carries on at an un-acceptably high rate, even with annual upratings the pensioners could be worse off in the end.

I agree with the hon. Member for Bedfordshire, South (Mr. Madel). You pulled him up, Sir Stephen, and I will not pursue the point except to say that inflation is the bugbear of us all. We must somehow sort it out, but no Government anywhere in the world found the answer. Even in the Soviet Union, where they will stick a striker up against the wall and shoot him, they have not solved their industrial relations problems. We do not want that here. It is no good blaming the unions. I will come to the point later, Sir Stephen, because it is important, but it does not come directly within the terms of these Amendments.

The Minister went on to answer a point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Southall (Mr. Bidwell) about a discrepancy of about £2 a week between the supplementary benefit scales and the basic pension rates. I was surprised when the Minister said that no survey had been made since 1966 of the numbers who failed to take up supplementary benefits, although they were entitled to them. I was also surprised when he went on to say that it was quite certain that the numbers were reducing. One cannot say the one thing and the other at the same time. If no survey has been made since 1966, one cannot know. The Minister cannot know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a document here called "Old Age" produced by the Office of Health Economics. It quotes a survey published in 1968. I do not know whether it is referring to the survey to which the Minister was referring, but the figures it produces are different and higher than those he quoted. I think he said about 700,000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, pensioners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I said earlier that not only are we dealing here with cash problems, but it is important to understand that old people see their cash problems from an angle different from ours. We are healthy, relatively young persons. The document says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Apart from a decline in physical and psychological powers, factors such as loss of economic security, approaching death, …"</p></blockquote>
—and we all face this, especially those of us in safe seats who are regularly asked how our health is—
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"… the indifference of their children and the deaths of their contemporaries are all bound to affect the emotional make-up of the aged, … Further factors include loss of

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>219</span>
sexual gratification and a feeling of loneliness and isolation and it has been suggested that retirement often leads to premature physical and mental illness."</p></blockquote>
It goes on to make the point to which the Minister referred about the take-up.
	<br><blockquote><p>"Although the majority of old persons receive state pensions or benefits the economic circumstances of the aged have been criticised on a number of grounds. Firstly, a minority of persons do not claim retirement pension or supplementary benefits. In a Ministry survey of persons of pensionable age …</p></blockquote>
—I presume this is the 1966 survey to which the Minister referred—
	<br><blockquote><p>"… it was estimated that 280,000 claimed neither pension nor supplementary benefit although some presumably had private incomes or private insurance. It was also estimated that 850,000 persons who were receiving a pension could have received assistance if they had applied for it. Wedderburn found that about 11 per cent. of those aged 65 and over had incomes lower than the national assistance scale rates but did not receive assistance. Strenuous efforts are now being made to improve this situation."</p></blockquote>
The Minister rightly paid tribute to the Labour Government for trying to do this, and I presume these efforts are continuing under the present Administration. It goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… it is argued that the average weekly income level of the aged is too low. In the Ministry's survey of 1965 it was found that just under half of aged married couples had incomes of less than £10 per week, a little over half of the single men and two-thirds of the single women had less than £6 a week. Wedderburn concluded from her survey that the aged had levels of income a half or less below the levels of the population generally. The survey goes on to discuss need as well as income."</p></blockquote>
I come to one of the points made by the hon. Member for Billericay (Mr. Mc-Crindle) earlier on about savings, when we were discussing the invalidity allowances. This is very relevant:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Ministry's survey found that most of their sample had income in addition to the state pension and benefits. The Wedderburn survey put the emphasis on the three out of ten who had no additional income. It also showed that for seven out of ten the state income was their 	<i>main</i> source of money."</p></blockquote>
We know very well that that is true.
	<br><blockquote><p>"These two surveys also showed that few old people had substantial savings or assets, that the older person the smaller their income and that the single and widowed women were the worst off. The Weddeburn survey concluded that some 600,000 to 700,000 individual old people were living below 'accepted' levels, the Ministry's survey that there were some 300,000 pensioners who were living solely on, or near to, the income derived from the state retirement pension."</p></blockquote>
I, for my sins, write a column in a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>220</span>
Sunday newspaper in Scotland and I quoted some of the figures that we were debating in this Committee and invited readers to send me letters explaining their circumstances. I sometimes feel that there is an air of unreality about our debates in these Committees and that we do not get enough among these people to talk to them and to hear from them individual cases. So I propose to quote from this letter. The writer says at the end that she does not want her name disclosed or her daughter who lives with her would be ashamed. She writes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I think you should know all the facts about some of us widows."</p></blockquote>
Very often the widows are much worse off than even a lot of the old age pensioners.
	<br><blockquote><p>"When my husband died 6 years ago I had to give up my work. I am now registered as a disabled person although I am now able to be out and about. After working all my life I received 30/-pension plus £3 sickness benefit. After about a year everyone got a rise on their sickness and I had then £3.10 plus my 30/-pension total amount of £5 p.w. When the new increases in widows' pensions began last October I then received £5.58 pension but I did not get any more insurance money. So what I am trying to tell you, Mr. Hamilton, is that after 6 years I am still living on this disgraceful amount of money although I do get a rent-rates rebate. It is shocking to ask any women to live on this amount, as we have to pay the same for fuel and groceries as people with large incomes. I got quite sick when I read your page about the pensions Ministers receive. I would say our ways of living are a complete slur on our society …"</p></blockquote>
She then goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I have one daughter unmarried at home with me who is a shop assistant with a small wage and she has to look respectable at all times, so you will know she is not able to give me very much. At the moment Royal Ascot is on television with those daft women and their stupid clothes while most of us cannot get a decent bite to eat. Since my husband died I have never been able to get any clothes at all, but my married son does buy me shoes when I need them. Last year I applied to Society Security for bed-clothes. They came to see my bed which is most embarrassing for us both but they did grant me something in the region of £7–£8. I do not remember exactly."</p></blockquote>
And so it goes on, and every Member of this Committee and of the House receives letters in that vein.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
