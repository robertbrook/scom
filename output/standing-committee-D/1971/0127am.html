<p><span class='member'>Mr. Anthony Fell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. In the OFFICIAL REPORT of our proceedings on Tuesday evening, I am reported as saying,
<br><blockquote><p>"… to the west again, it is water—drain water."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Standing Committee D,</i> 25th January, 1972; <i>c.</i> 1003.]</p></blockquote>
That should have read,
<br><blockquote><p>"… it is water—Bradon Water."</p></blockquote>
I can understand that a mistake should have been made at that time of night, but I should like it to be corrected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Hannam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. The report in HANSARD of our proceedings on Tuesday morning, in col. 883, refers, in a description of the Tamar districts, to "Plumpton St. Mary", instead of "Plympton St. Mary", and again, in col. 888, "Clifton St. Mary" should be "Plympton St. Mary". Could that be corrected?</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moate</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Amendment stands in the names of my hon. Friends the Members for Dorking (Sir G. Sinclair), Surrey. East (Mr. William Clark) Chertsey (Mr. Michael Grylls) and Carshalton (Captain Walter Elliott), and I am very conscious that I am speaking on behalf of a large number of Surrey Members who are unfortunate enough not to be represented on the Committee. It is hard to do justice to the case which they would have put with so much more force and advocacy. I am also speaking on behalf of 17,500 residents of Charlwood and Horley who feel—and I use the word advisedly—passionately in their opposition to the proposed transfer to another county. Indeed, I speak on behalf of the whole county of Surrey, which is resolutely opposed to the proposed loss of this area to another county.<br><br>
I am sure that the Committee has understood the significance of the Government's proposals. What is proposed is that Gatwick Airport, together with the communities of Horley and Charlwood, should be transferred from Surrey to the new county of West Sussex. I should like very briefly to describe the public reaction since the final proposals emerged when the Bill was published. I begin by quoting from a leaflet which members of the Committee will have received last night or this morning:
<br><blockquote><p>"Threatened with transfer to West Sussex under the Bill for local government reorganisation, they are putting up a spirited fight to retain their identity as communities whose economic, social and traditional ties fall on the Surrey side of the county boundary. Their rejection of the Government's proposal to divorce the area in which they live from the county in which they want to stay has been immediate and wholehearted."</p></blockquote>
I understand that there has been a petition and, though the petition forms have not yet all been returned, I have seen it quoted that 84 per cent. of the population have already expressed their opposition to the proposed transfer. I have seen references to the large numbers of public meetings which have been held, all of which have vociferously and nearly unanimously supported the Surrey County Council's action to prevent the transfer. I see that at one meeting the vote was 134 to three; another one was 126 to one, and another 381 to nine. I am sure that the Committee has grasped the fact that there
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0552">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1013</span>
is overwhelming—indeed, near total—opposition to the proposal as far as the people of Horley and Charlwood are concerned. My hon. Friend the Member for Dorking described it as "an explosion of public opinion" against the proposed change.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend and hon. Friend have been very sympathetic and sensitive throughout the discussions on this Bill wherever public opinion has been concerned, and properly so, and I think this has been welcomed by the Committee at every stage. I am sure, therefore, in response to this expression of public opinion which, let us accept, is a new factor since the original proposals were published, that they will concede that, as far as these communities are concerned, they should remain with the county which they regard as their own and not be transferred into the new county of West Sussex.<br><br>
But this is only half the case. Again I would draw attention to the pamphlet which hon. Members will have received. The slogan on the front is "Keep Gat-wick in Surrey". I suspect this is the crucial matter about which we are likely to be arguing this morning. I hope we shall not be arguing; I hope that my hon. Friends have studied the information that has been sent to them and are already persuaded that there is no case objectively for the transfer of this airport and these communities into the new county of West Sussex.<br><br>
It is obvious to every member of this Committee that we are talking about an airport which is often referred to as "London Airport-Gatwick", and there is basically something of a nonsense in the suggestion that one should transfer what is essentially a London-oriented airport away from the new county adjacent to Greater London to another county one stage removed which is very substantially oriented towards the South Coast.<br><br>
No one will argue that the population and growth effects of an airport can be limited to any particular county boundary. Such effects will spread over into Sussex and Surrey, but much of the impact of this airport will continue to have its effect over Surrey. The noise factor, which is a dominant consideration when deciding airport matters, will continue to have its impact on Surrey. The line of the runways will ensure that it is the new
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1014</span>
Surrey that will continue to suffer noise and which will have to take steps to adjust to that factor. All the communication links with Gatwick, the road and rail factors, and the service factor such as hotels and so on that one associates with an airport, will spread out naturally along the communication links northwards to London and not southwards into West Sussex.<br><br>
Therefore, whenever one looks at the effects of this airport, with the one exception of residential expansion, Surrey obviously has the greater vested interest in continuing to maintain the area around Gatwick Airport. I think it is very valid to point out to the Committee that Surrey has in recent years acquired an international reputation in relation to its planning administration of the area around Gatwick Airport. I am told, and I am sure it is correct, that my right hon. Friend's Department. When it receives inquiries from foreign planners, about airport matters, actually sends these foreign observers to Surrey County Council because Surrey has an unrivalled reputation for the way in which it has handled all the very difficult problems associated with airport growth. It has very clear policies that have been effective in ensuring that around Gatwick Airport proper environmental considerations are taken into account. It has an environmental study that ensures that proper planning is undertaken in the area around the airport, a policy to protect the open land wherever possible, to provide for industry, offices, warehouses and such matters, and residential accommodation, but to ensure that it is in the right places. So, again, I am sure there is no doubt in the minds of anyone that Surrey has unrivalled expertise and experience that it has built upon this very specialist subject in recent years.<br><br>
If it is to be transferred to another county administration, it will obviously be quite a few years before a new body of expertise and experience is built up by the new administrators. That cannot be a healthy thing to anticipate when we are talking about a matter as crucial to the lives of people as planning the facility of an airport.<br><br>
This leads to another important factor, which I hope hon. Members will retain in their minds when deciding on this issue, and that is the existence of a green belt to the south of the airport, between
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0553">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1015</span>
Gatwick Airport and Crawley. This is an important planning factor. I also emphasise that it is a natural county boundary between the two and a boundary that has been created and defended by successive Goverments as a major factor in planning policy.<br><br>
One can understand local fears that if one puts Gatwick and Crawley into one new district, within one new county, the green belt could well be eroded by the inevitable and desirable expansion of a successful and thrusting new town. There is a natural boundary between these two.<br><br>
I know that hon. Members will often have been to Gatwick Airport and there is a superficial association in people's minds of Gatwick and Crawley. But I suggest that it is superficial when considering local government boundaries and I am sure that my right hon. Friend will not have made any superficial judgment about this matter; it will be exceptional if he has.<br><br>
There is—and the Maud Commission Report spelt this out—a close social and economic link between Gatwick and Crawley. But equally the Maud Commission pointed out that there were just as strong links between Gatwick and Horley and that area and Reigate. Again one draws the obvious conclusion that with an airport of this nature there are widespread, far flung economic links with the whole of the surrounding area.<br><br>
It is significant to note that Maud did not propose that the airport should be transferred into the southerly county. They suggested that it should be kept together but that it should be transferred to Surrey. What we are facing here is a direct reversal of the Maud Commission proposal. I am not necessarily against reversing Maud—we have done quite a lot of that—but we can draw certain lessons from it. On public opinion grounds, and airport planning grounds, there is no case for transferring this into Sussex.<br><br>
I suspect that what we are really discussing is the whole question of planning for the growth area in the context of the South East regional studies. I. believe this is what has motivated the Government in trying to move this important airport and its neighbouring communities into Sussex.<br><br>
In the Strategic Plan for the South-East, this area was described as growth
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1016</span>
area No. 6 and, at that time, it spread over different county boundaries. This is the sole reason why the Government are prepared to transfer it, simply to ensure that one has this one growth area, growth area No. 6, under the one county administration. On the face of it, that is the logical argument. I then ask the Government, is it their policy that all such growth areas should be under one county administration, or are there any areas where they are not following such a principle?<br><br>
One does not have to look very far—only to the other side of the county—to show that the Government have already totally conceded that it is not necessary for such a growth area to fall within one county. One has only to look at the area which is described as growth area No. 8, the Reading, Wokingham, Aldershot and Basingstoke districts, a major growth area, which is to be administered, under the new plans, by joint planning committees of three counties, Hampshire, Berkshire and Surrey. Not only have the Government conceded this case totally, but they went a bit further because, as a change between the White Paper proposals and the new plans, they reconsidered and have allowed part of the area that was in Surrey and was proposed to go to Hampshire to stay in Surrey. We have a total concession on that particular point.<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
We still have the whole vital question of the growth area, which is growth area No. 6, Gatwick, Crawley and the surrounding areas. One of the major factors in this was the belief that there would be a second runway at Gatwick airport. Hon. Members will note that this is no longer proposed, so one of the major dynamic factors in that area has now been removed. That is not to say that will not continue to be a major growth area; an airport must remain such a major factor and obviously the Crawley industries will generate a considerable dynamic in that area.<br><br>
It is significant that it has been suggested that nearly all the housing in the immediate future, certainly up till 1981, can be built to the north, actually in the Horley area and in the existing Surrey area. So it is only in the longer term that the residential accommodation will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0554">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1017</span>
need to be built south in the Crawley area.<br><br>
Essentially we have two different problems, north and south. To the south we have a major growth factor demand, with new industry and the need for a considerable amount of housing. To the north it is vitally important to conserve the open land that exists, to protect the green belt between Gatwick and Crawley, and generally to relate what land there is to the special land uses and not to the expansion factors related to the housing and industrial growth of this area.<br><br>
There are, therefore, two different factors which lead to the conclusion that there should be two different structure plans for those areas, but within an overall planning strategy for the whole area. There is nothing to prevent this being done and continuing on a properly planned basis if there are, as there will be. two councils administering or responsible for this growth area. There already is a Sussex-Surrey Joint Planning Advisory Committee to deal with the common planning problems that arise from this airport.<br><br>
I hope I have outlined relatively briefly—in relation to the vast amount of persuasive material which has been produced so assiduously by those hon. Members and officials of that area—and made it clear that there is no case at all for the movement of the communities of Horley, Charlwood and the airport of Gatwick from Surrey into Sussex.<br><br>
I conclude by quoting the words of my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister who said:
<br><blockquote><p>"… no one in their right senses is in favour of change for change's sake."</p></blockquote>
I submit that on the basis of that criterion, no case has been made out for the transfer of this area into the county of West Sussex.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Martin Maddan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have listened with great attention and respect to my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate). He spoke with such knowledge of the neighbouring County of Kent that I am tempted to think that he must be a Kentish man and not a man of Kent from the distant eastern areas of Kent.<br><br>
I speak as a Member for East Sussex and not for West Sussex. In doing so I know that I speak for West Sussex and for the private Members of West Sussex;
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1018</span>
there are two of them and there are two others who are Government Ministers for whom I am not able to speak. But I thought my hon. Friend rather overdid his case when he said that there were no grounds at all for suggesting the transfer of the area concerned, Gatwick and Crawley, to West Sussex. If there had been no grounds at all, I do not think the Government would have put the proposal forward. There are, in fact, quite strong grounds, and these should be voiced.<br><br>
They depend upon the problem of Gatwick, which is the substantial point in regard to public opinion. He said at the beginning of his speech that it would be terrible if it were transferred from Surrey because of all the experience which the people of Surrey have about it. But he undermined that at the end of his speech by referring to the joint committee of the Sussex and Surrey County Councils, which have been working on the problems of Gatwick for a long time.<br><br>
Of course, one can say "If there is a joint committee, why not let it go on?" The argument is that single control in areas where one can conveniently obtain it is better than joint committees. One could have a joint committee covering the whole of the United Kingdom, but we know that that would end up in a mushy nonsense.<br><br>
It is perfectly true that Surrey County Council has got a very good reputation, but it would be quite wrong to imagine that the West Sussex County Council was not also experienced, and, certainly, no less concerned to limit airport noise; no less concerned to secure proper control over expansion in the area which will inevitably follow, as my hon. Friend said, from the mere existence of the airport; no less concerned to maintain green belt areas, not only between the airport and Crawley, but in other parts of the whole of central Sussex, including the area between Crawley and Burgess Hill—another area designated for substantial expansion.<br><br>
Finally, my hon. Friend seemed to presuppose that transport links would change as the county boundaries changed. In a previous constituency, when I was Member for Hitchin, I remember that there was concern as to whether Royston might move from Hertfordshire to Cambridgeshire, and one dear old soul in Royston
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0555">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1019</span>
was greatly opposed to going into Cambridgeshire because she said, the weather there was so much worse.<br><br>
I have risen to put briefly a view on behalf not only of the authorities of West Sussex but also of others concerned in this area which is going to be the subject of substantial growth—Crawley and Burgess Hill—that Gatwick Airport, which involves Horley and Crawley, should be within one planning authority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Hannam</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate), I have been asked to express to the Committee the strong opposition to proposals in the Bill to carve out a piece of Surrey and transfer it to West Sussex. Representatives of the Dorking, Horley and Charlwood Councils, the Surrey County Council, and Gatwick Airport Consultative Committee, have, together with my hon. Friend the Member for Dorking (Sir G. Sinclair), discussed in detail the arguments laid out in the batch of papers which members of the Committee should have received by this morning.<br><br>
I have some knowledge of this area through visits to Horley and Crawley and through flying in and out of Gatwick, and journeys to and from London. I am sure that other hon. Members have similar working knowledge of the area. In examining this part of the Bill, it is easy to judge the merits or demerits of the case put forward by the amount of literature poured into our hands, but in the case of Gatwick and Horley and Charlwood area the local campaign in presenting the feelings of the residents and the evidence in support of these Amendments has been rather late in developing. I should like to outline briefly the reasons for the delay.<br><br>
About a year ago the Government White Paper proposed that Charlwood parish, including Gatwick airport, should become part of West Sussex. There was widespread consternation in the area, and at a public meeting at which both Surrey and West Sussex County Councils presented arguments for and against the transfer this was rejected by an overwhelming majority, the voting being in the region of 214 to 2. Representations were then made to the Ministry and it was hoped that the actual Bill when published would reverse this proposal.<br><br>
It is only in recent weeks that the people of the area have realised that a further
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1020</span>
area of Surrey had been added to the transfer area—Horley, with a population of some 14,000. Public meetings were immediately organised by teachers and local authorities at which overwhelming rejections of this transfer were voted: 134 to 3; 126 to 1; 381 to 9. Now a petition, which has over 10,000 signatures, is being circulated through local trade, social, educational and administrative organisations, which have combined to oppose an ill-conceived proposal. There can, therefore, be no doubt of the strength of the feelings of the people of Horley and Charlwood—17,500 of them—plus the strength of feeling of the administrators of the airport and of the adjoining areas of Dorking and Reigate.<br><br>
I must be accurate, though. I understand that the local Communist party is in favour of the transfer, at least, he stood up in support of it at a meeting.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Faversham has outlined as well as anyone could possibly do the many important factors related to this argument. I should like to state briefly one or two points which we should be considering. The nub of this proposal, as he said, must be Gatwick Airport, which is London's second airport. It is oriented towards London, and to the north towards Heathrow. It is closely interwoven in its planning with Surrey County Council. Its flight path and its noise corridors lie over Surrey. Its protective green belt area to the south provides a neutral and desirable county border.<br><br>
Following the Government decision to limit Gatwick to one runway, the estimates of housing needs for future airfield employees have been drastically reduced. A further 5,000 houses are planned for Horley during the next 10 years to accommodate the increase expected of some 12,000 working population at Gatwick. The original South-East Planning Strategy for the Crawley New Town area, the No. 6 Area, included Gatwick because of the envisaged two-runway development, which could have triggered off substantial population growth, which could not possibly have been provided for in South-East Surrey. That asumption has probably influenced the Government in putting forward their proposals, but I seriously do not see that they apply now.<br><br>
There is no strong case for carving this piece out of South-East Surrey, creating a bottleneck at the narrow end of the coun-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0556">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1021</span>
ty, upsetting the very successful planning collaboration which exists between Surrey and Sussex, and ignoring the feelings, which have been so positively expressed, of the inhabitants of Charlwood and of Horley.<br><br>
The Royal Commission actually proposed that Crawley should go into Surrey. Now it is proposed to reverse that suggestion. I do not believe that my hon. Friend should override these very strong and fervent arguments which have been expressed through these Amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take as my starting point the fact that the County of Sussex has, in these proposals, taken a bite out of the County of Surrey and made a substantial dent in the boundary, and one is therefore bound to ask why. I have therefore listened with careful attention to the arguments, and particularly to those put forward by hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Maddan). As I understand it. he rested virtually the whole of his case on the planning problems that would arise from Gatwick Airport.<br><br>
Of course, there are planning problems arising out of Gatwick Airport, but they affect both Surrey and Sussex. Both counties are affected by future developments at the airport, the possibility of the construction of future runways. But I submit that in respect of the mode of use of the airport, flying times, and flight path, the County of Surrey is affected far more intimately. If one were resting one's case purely on the planning argument, I would agree that it is very finely balanced, but it would be marginally in favour of Gatwick remaining in Surrey.<br><br>
There is another argument which I do not think any of my hon. Friends has advanced, and that is the question of drainage, which I think is important. A great deal of the surface water from Gatwick Airport and sewage effluent from the area drains into the River Mole, which flows towards London, and which was, in 1968, one of the scenes of severe flooding. I think there is an argument that control, from that point of view, should remain within the control of Surrey County Council.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moate</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend allow me to make a further point on that matter, that, under the Government's new proposals, the Gatwick area would
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1022</span>
be in the regional water authority area No. 6, namely the London area, rather than the Sussex area, which I think bears out the point he has just made?</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for what he has said, which reinforces my point.<br><br>
I believe it has been argued that Gatwick should go into Sussex because it has an affinity with Crawley. I personally doubt this. Although I do not live in the area, I tend to think of Gatwick as part of the Redhill and Reigate complex. But if were true that Gatwick has a close affinity with Crawley, I should have thought that the argument could have been met as well by including Crawley in Surrey. But that has not been proposed.<br><br>
I find the arguments fairly evenly balanced, though marginally in favour of Surrey, and in that situation I think one must do what the Government have done in the case of Essex, and rely on the weight of local opinion. On these grounds, I should have thought that the case was almost overwhelming, because the rural district council, the two parish councils, the local chamber of commerce, the residents' association, other local organisations and even, I believe, local schoolgirls, are solidly in favour of Gatwick remaining in Surrey. I therefore hope that the Government will act as they did in the case of Essex and have regard to local opinion and agree to these Amendments which have been moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patrick Cormack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would hesitate to intervene were it not for the fact that my hon. Friend the Member for Dorking (Sir G. Sinclair), who is not on the Committee, has been most earnest in his entreaties that I should say a word on behalf of these Amendments.<br><br>
I have been extremely impressed, as I am sure the Committee has, by the eloquence of my three hon. Friends who have just spoken, and although I always have a very high regard for any argument advanced by my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Maddan) I must say that on this occasion I feel that his case does not hold a great deal of water. I sincerely request my hon. Friend is to reply at the very least to promise to

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1023</span>
think again about this point and to give the local people an extra chance to be consulted, because there is obviously, as my hon. Friend the Member for Dartford (Mr. Trew) has just said, enormous feeling locally here. There is no real case for a change of this magnitude when the local people feel as they do, and so I beg my hon. Friend to give them a chance to be heard once more, and not to give a definitive "No".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Michael Heseltine)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I always listen to the arguments put forward by any member of this Committee, and I would say to my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) that I am certainly very impressed by the arguments that he deployed in this particular case. Whenever one deals with deeply-expressed public opinion, it is particularly attractive that one should do everything possible to try to help the people concerned because, after all, they live there, it is their home, and they know what the effect is likely to be.<br><br>
I think one has to start, as my hon. Friend the Member for Dartford (Mr. Trew) said, with the broad lie of the land and the main planning issues involved. Although I think it has been referred to individually in parts, I do not think that anyone has added together the one generalisation which must be made—that every time somebody has looked at this area, whether it be the Redcliffe-Maud proposals or whether it be the Government's White Paper proposals, or the Government's present proposals, the conclusion has been that there is a close and direct relationship between the communities that we are discussing this morning, the communities of Gatwick and Crawley, and the airport. The Redcliffe-Maud proposals were not those advocated by the present Government, but nevertheless they suggested that Crawley and Gatwick should be kept together, together with Horley, and placed in what we could refer to as an area which embraced south-east Surrey. That was one piece of evidence which we have to consider.<br><br>
The second piece of evidence comes from the South-East Joint Planning Study which again looked at this whole question of the growth area in the southeast of England, and they too delineated a growth area which embraced in the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1024</span>
north-west corner Horley, Crawley and Charlwood, and went across to the growth area on the east side of East Grinstead down to Haywards Heath, and the various other areas referred to by my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Maddan). That was the second time when the matter has been looked at and when the areas have been kept together for planning purposes.<br><br>
It is perfectly true to say, as my hon. Friend, the hon. Member for Faversham said, that there are occasions when growth areas are being administered by joint committees or, in the case he referred to, three counties. But the particular growth area that he referred to is a much larger one and much more isolated in terms of communities than the growth area that we are now considering. It stretches from Northants, Milton Keynes, Berkshire, Hampshire and Surrey. Therefore, the extension of this is such that it would not be possible to bring it into one county administration; indeed, it would be quite impossible. So there is a difference between these particular growth areas.<br><br>
The argument seemed to us that, as everybody who had looked at this matter had come to the conclusion that it should be administered broadly together, we should seek a solution which brought together the airport of Gatwick with the largest nearest urban area of Crawley. Our original proposals, in the White Paper 8/71, took the parish of Charlwood together with the airport of Gatwick and added it to the Crawley area. This was the subject then of consultation. The community of Horley, in the period of consultation, took the very strong view that they wished to be associated with the airport and it was certainly the strong impression which we had that they wished, above all else, to be associated with the airport. They argued certainly that the airport should go into Surrey. But it seemed that their biggest preoccupation—and I can well understand this—was that they should be associated with the airport which is close to them.<br><br>
The only way in which this could have been achieved, together with the other factors which I have mentioned, would have been to move Crawley, Gatwick and Horley into an area which would be represented by Surrey. So one would then be having the arguments today not about
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0558">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1025</span>
Horley and Charlwood, but about Crawley which would then be in a situation of having been moved in a way that I do not think they would have wanted to do. We were left with trying to find a solution to this difficult problem which, overwhelmingly on planning grounds, argued for one authority.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the hon. Member for Faversham raised two important matters which, in his submission, militated in favour of the proposals in the Amendment—first of all, the noise factor and secondly the green belt factor. Nobody more than a Minister in the Department of the Environment would wish to pay tribute to the determined attempts of the Surrey County Council in the preservation of green belt in their area. But equally—my hon. Friend would want to be fair—the same thing could be said of the West Sussex County Council.<br><br>
The Department of the Environment plays a considerable part in the maintenance of green belt. It is quite impossible for any change in green belt policy to take place without the approval of my Secretary of State. So even if we did not have, which we certainly have, determined county authorities, there is the ultimate sanction of the Secretary of State which I have not the slightest doubt will be as rigidly, if not more rigidly, applied in the future as it has in the past.<br><br>
This is the case as well in terms of the noise factor. I pay great tribute to the contributions which Surrey County Council have made. But in the ultimate, planning decisions affecting noise must come to the Secretary of State who is the ultimate arbiter in these matters.<br><br>
So I believe that whilst the fears are totally understandable, and no one would have them more than I would if I lived in this area, the difficulties that could in practice arise are something which we do not need to take too seriously because I do not believe they ever would arise.<br><br>
The fact of the matter is, even with one runway, the number of employees at Gatwick will double in the future. This is going to create a very real demand for additional housing. It is bound to create questions of communication, in addition to the communications problems which will come from the growth areas themselves. It seems to us that the areas in which it is most likely that housing will
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1026</span>
be provided for the expected employees are to the south, rather than to the north, since more land is available to the south. I think that that again argues in favour of trying to keep the areas in question together.<br><br>
We are therefore left with an attempt to see whether there is any way in which one can meet the strong feelings of the people of the areas in question. Whilst the Government are convinced that there are overwhelming arguments, in terms of planning, for keeping the airport of Gatwick with the urban area of Crawley, it would certainly be possible to look, between now and Report, at the views of the people of Horley and Charlwood, if they wish to remain in Surrey but not in the same county as the Airport. I have to say that I should regard such an arrangement as a mistake. I think that it would be a pity and that the arguments are in favour of keeping the communities in question together. Nevertheless, if there were to be an overwhelming public expression of opinion that the boundary of Surrey should be drawn somewhere between the two communities in question and the Airport, certainly we would look again at the possibility when we come to Report.<br><br>
I hope that that answer will be helpful to my hon. Friends. Certainly, I should not like to see such an arrangement implemented, but the undertaking is an indication of our sincere determination to try to listen to public opinion if that opinion, faced with the real issue—that is, whether there should be a separation between the two communities and the Airport—focuses and makes up its mind that it is prepared to stay in Surrey under those conditions. I urge my hon. Friends not to press the Amendment, which would, I believe, have the effect of making a nonsense of all the investigations.of the area on planning grounds which have recently been carried out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moate</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to deal with a point which my hon. Friend made regarding growth area No. 8, which he said was on such a scale that it formed a rather different proposition from growth area No. 6 which we are now discussing. Of course, one can see that there are great differences and that it is not always possible to ensure that every growth area falls within a single county, even though that might, in theory, be desirable. How-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0559">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1027</span>
ever, I do not think that my hon. Friend really answered the point that it was open to the Government to ensure a more tidy administration for growth area No. 8 but that they went to the other extreme. It had been proposed that parts of Hampshire would come into Surrey, but they allowed those areas to revert to Hampshire, which added a further complication to the planning administration of that region. I do not think that he answered that point fully.<br><br>
Of course, one accepts the general point which he made about the links between the different parts of that growth area, but I do not believe that he has persuaded us—certainly, he has not persuaded me—that such planning matters cannot properly be accommodated within the powers and methods of joint planning committees. This must apply in many areas over the country and I do not think that quoting a series of reports, without adducing any arguments in favour of the proposals, has made a persuasive case.<br><br>
However, I am sure that the people of the area will respond gratefully to my hon. Friend's undertaking to accept their views as to what should happen to their own communities. I am sure that that point will be well taken and, as always, he has been most sensitive on that score. Equally, though, I feel that his point is also valid—and it has been emphasised time and time again—that Horley and Charlwood and the airport are really inseparable, so it would pose a dilemma if they were confronted with the alternative of separation from Gatwick or of moving collectively into the new county.<br><br>
I am disappointed at what my hon. Friend has had to say about Gatwick Airport, and I should like to ask him to be a little more helpful for one reason in particular. This is the first occasion that any reasons have been put forward to the Surrey County Council or to the people of that area for the proposed transfer of Gatwick Airport. So far they have not had any arguments at all. Will my hon. Friend, between now and Report, look again very closely at the whole question whether or not Gatwick should be transferred? I feel the case is against the transfer. Would he, at least, look at this, allow the people of that area and the County council to consider the arguments which he has put forward, and, in turn, put up their own arguments to him? It
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1028</span>
would then be for him to weigh up those matters, and to allow those matters to be brought up again on Report for further discussion.</span></p>
<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend knows, I have no control at all over what matters are raised on Report. It would often be very convenient to Governments if they had such control, but that is not the way it works, and quite rightly so. It is obviously entirely for hon. Members to seek to persuade Mr. Speaker that Amendment should be moved on that occasion.<br><br>
The difficulty is that if I were to give the assurance that my hon. Friend requests, that the consideration of the transfer of Gatwick should be open for further discussions, one would be left with the difficulty of reaching a final decision on what people actually want. As I understand it, the argument is that people want to live in Surrey, but the problem is that they cannot live in Surrey without the airport, because this is an indissoluble part of their community. But the airport is an indissoluble part of the community of Crawley as well, and Crawley is a great deal larger than these communities.<br><br>
This is where the problem is. Having a map in front of me—and I am sure all hon. Members are familiar with it—it is obvious that there is a real community of interest here, which would be separated by the proposals that the Amendment embodies. It is perfectly true that it is separated today. But the whole purpose of local government reorganisation is to try to look at these areas, where the cases on planning grounds are overwhelming, and try to bring about a rationalisation in all the circumstances.<br><br>
May I deal also with a point that I may not have made as clear as I should like in my first intervention. When I was talking about the growth areas, which are administered by joint countries, I was talking about two growth areas. I hope I did not give the impression that there was a massive growth area from Northampton and Milton Keynes down into the areas of Berkshire, North-East Hampshire and West Surrey. There are, of course, two growth areas involved, administered jointly there.<br><br>
On the particular change of mind that we felt able to make—and I would say at once that local opinion played a part
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0560">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1029</span>
in this—it was not felt that the area to be transferred, between the Consultative Document and the Bill, was of such crucial importance that the overwhelming planning arguments made it necessary to take a firm stand against the views of the local people. But in this area, I believe the planning arguments are quite different. Therefore, I am saying that I hope very much that, on mature reflection, the local people will come to the same conclusion.<br><br>
If we have to make up our minds about Gatwick, which I think it right that we should, Gatwick should be associated with the nearest major urban area, which is that of Crawley. This leaves what I would regard as a regrettable option, if it were to be exercised, by the people of Horley and Charlwood, that they should be dissociated from the airport in another county. If they felt particularly strongly about being in Surrey, that would be an option for them.<br><br>
I hope that we can leave for Report one option, and not two, because I think this would be liable to confuse the issue.<br><br>
May I deal with this last point, which would worry me greatly if I thought it was totally justified, which was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham. That is that the people in this area have never had the argument put to them. I think it is difficult to sustain this suggestion, when Redcliffe-Maud looked at it, and published in detail his arguments for associating the areas together, when the Government produced a Consultative Document, which has been discussed, and joint meetings were held in the area. The arguments may not have been convincing, but there was a joint meeting at which the county council sought to explain the situation.<br><br>
There has been a large amount of publicity attendant upon the South-East Joint Planning Study Report, which deals with the question of the growth area at great length. Everybody in the area must know its implications.<br><br>
I do not think that people can seriously say that these arguments have not been fully deployed and understood locally. That is not the same as saying that they have been accepted locally. That is a different issue. I cannot believe that anyone living in this area does not understand what the planning issues and the growth arguments are all about. However,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1030</span>
they may have different views as to whether they like them or not.<br><br>
I have helped as much as I can in giving some indication of the options which might be available, however wrong I might feel it would be if they were to be exercised. I hope that my hon. Friend will be assured that we have done our best to help.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Strictly within the rules of order, I should like to make an aside; we may call it "the wit and wisdom of Silkin". The hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) made his case very strongly on the deeply-held sentiments of the people. I am bound to say that I thought that the Under-Secretary of State made the slightly stronger case for putting the areas together. I listened very carefully to both of them; I do not think that there is any doubt that they must be kept together, and, frankly, it follows that Crawley must go into West Sussex.<br><br>
However, my aside is this: the whole of this difficulty would be resolved if one were able to have a regional council which could look at the whole planning problem, because the sentiments of the people who wanted to remain in Surrey would be overwhelming from that point of view, but the planning considerations could be dealt with by a global authority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moate</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is obviously some disappointment at the Minister's remarks, but, bearing in mind his efforts to be generous as far as public feeling is concerned, I feel that there is success on that particular score. I should like to think that this matter can still be pursued, and in order that can be the case I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maddan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 377, in page 192, line 30, leave out "Cuckfield and East Grinstead" and insert "and Cuckfield".<br><br>
The Amendment stands in my name and in the names of my hon. Friends, all the Members for Sussex, with the exception only of two Ministers, the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Mr. Amery) who is the Minister for Housing and Construction and as such is within the Department of the Environment, and my hon. Friend the Member for East Grinstead (Mr. G. Johnson Smith) who is Under-Secretary
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0561">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1031</span>
of State for Defence for the Army, about whose constituency we are talking. Of course, the right hon. Gentleman is not able to participate in these discussions, but the Committee will understand that my hon. Friends and myself would not do anything to embarrass him. Indeed, a great deal of what I have to say is based upon correspondence from constituents of my hon. Friend the Member for East Grinstead.<br><br>
When proposals were made for the boundary between East and West Sussex, they included very substantial changes from the present position. East Sussex has finally agreed, after preliminary misgivings, and it has settled down to a realisation of the policy for this area. It has agreed to the loss of the urban districts of Burgess Hill and Cuckfield and the rural district of Cuckfield. Between them, those three districts constitute 12 per cent. of the new county of East Sussex, including the county boroughs and including East Grinstead, and 10 per cent. of the rateable value. Therefore, that is a very substantial loss which East Sussex has accepted.<br><br>
Nor has East Sussex pressed for the transfer, which it might have done on logical grounds, of Southwick and Shoreham urban districts which are really parts of Brighton conurbation, but which are cut off from East Sussex and remain in West Sussex. However, it is very concerned at the proposal for the transfer of East Grinstead from East Sussex to West Sussex. East Grinstead is a town of 18,000 people, who are not anxious to transfer to West Sussex. The urban district council has never pressed for the transfer, although it has latterly acquiesced in the Government's proposal. The West Sussex County Council has never pressed for the transfer of East Grinstead, although it has acquiesced in the Government's proposal.<br><br>
I cannot think what the Government's reasons are, but there are good reasons why nobody in East or West Sussex or in East Grinstead has pressed for that transfer. I want to state my reasons for saying that East Grinstead should remain in East Sussex. One is that a new bypass will be built in the part of the M23 motorway complex which will cut off East Grinstead from Crawley and West Sussex. The children from the countryside to the south-east of East Grinstead must con-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1032</span>
tinue to go to school in East Grinstead. Of that there can be no question.<br><br>
If hon. Members will look at the map of East Sussex, though it is hard to read the photo-copies—they will not see very much to the south-east of East Grinstead. That is, however, a very faithful reproduction of reality, because there is very little to the south-east of East Grinstead. There is no other natural centre for that hinterland other than East Grinstead. From the point of view of schools and children coming to East Grinstead it is worse than that, because the East Sussex-West Sussex boundary is, in fact, a regional divide. The C.S.E. exams, in West Sussex come under the southern, and in East Sussex in south-east region.<br><br>
The school pattern and policy of the two counties are different. Adult education policy is different. Why should there be this upset for both teachers and children? It would be far better to amalgamate East Grinstead with the Uckfield rural district, as the East Sussex County Council had in mind. It would make a district of 72,000 inhabitants. It is very difficult to make any other satisfactory arrangements for this rural area. East Grinstead is the natural centre.<br><br>
West Hoathly, closely allied to East Grinstead. is supposed to go into West Sussex, as part of the Cuckfield rural district. That could easily be dealt with and it could be kept with East Grinstead. if East Grinstead were retained in East Sussex, by a minor adjustment. East Grinstead is not necessary to the Cuckfield urban or rural district, or the Burgess Hill area, or West Sussex.<br><br>
One final point—not strictly a local government point but certainly relevant: the Oueen Victoria Hosoital in East Grinstead is both a community hospital and a leading plastic surgical centre, famous throughout the world. It is the bums unit and maxillo-facial unit for the whole of the south-east region under the South-East Metropolitan Regional Hosoital Board So it must remain There will not be another hospital with those specialities in the south-east, region.<br><br>
Area health board boundaries will follow county boundaries Therefore if Fast Grienstead goes to West Sussex we shall have the anomaly that the Queen Victoria Hospital, which serves the southeast region, will be administered under
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0562">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1033</span>
the South-West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board.<br><br>
So far as can be adduced there is no public enthusiasm in East Grinstead in favour of the change. We can adduce only reluctant acquiescence. There are substantial grounds for opposition. My plea is that we should leave well alone and avoid creating hostility between East Sussex and West Sussex, which are inclined to work amicably together.<br><br>
I hope that my hon. Friend will remember what the Minister said in the case of Essex and Sussex, and the importance of not exacerbating the relationship between the two counties of East and West Sussex where there had been a great spirit of give and take to the mutual benefit of both.</span></p>
<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I argued on the same side as my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Maddan) in favour of preserving the growth area under one administrative county, I was slightly apprehensive as to what we should find ourselves saying on this Amendment, when he tried to take part of the growth area out. As he was, presumably, in agreement with my general case last time he will find that the case still stands on this Amendment.<br><br>
The fact is that East Grinstead is part of the growth area about which I was talking in the last Amendment, and which was delineated in the South-East Joint Planning Study. Therefore it must be in terms of planning, communications and development that East Grinstead will increasingly look to the areas to the south-west and west as the growth predicted for this area develops in the years ahead. It would seem sensible, therefore, that it should be placed in the same administrative county as will deal with the rest of that growth area.<br><br>
I would not want to argue the case on public opinion grounds, because the representations from the East Grinstead council are not in support of the Government proposals, although it is true to say that public opinion has not been deeply sounded or expressed in this case, either. So I think the argument is in favour of the planning case at which we have looked already.<br><br>
The case of the hospital, raised by my
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1034</span>
hon. Friend has been raised on a number of occasions in various parts of the country. People have felt that if county boundaries were changed hospitals now serving communities would in some way cease to serve them. We considered the point with great care, in order to establish that that was not the case. The hospital will still be there and the same people will use it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maddan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend say who will run it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The administration of the hospital is less important to the people than the service they get and the fact that the hospital exists. There is no argument for saying that the quality of administration will deteriorate in any way with our new proposals for the Health Service reorganisation. I hope that my hon. Friend will agree that the same service from the same hospital would be available.<br><br>
In whichever county that East Grinstead found itself it would be very much in one corner. It is very much at the centre of an area that crosses county boundaries. Many services in East Grinstead are probably provided for people who live in counties outside that in which East Grinstead is situated. That is bound to be the case. The hospital is an example of precisely that sort. But it is to misunderstand the Bill to refer to the loss by East Sussex in this particular context, because under the Bill, East Sussex will be a very different sort of organisation from that in which it is at the moment, simply because the authorities at Brighton, Eastbourne and Hastings are being brought into the county, which will greatly increase the size that it would be if that change had not been brought about.<br><br>
I much hope that, looking at all the arguments, my hon. Friend will agree that we should try to keep the parts of this growth area together. For the reasons that I put forward on the last Amendment, I think it <i>is</i> important; that is where the development is to be. It is important to see that it is carried out properly and carefully in the years ahead, in order to protect the interests of the people who live in these areas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maddan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to make three quick points. First, East Sussex has no empire-buiding interest in this matter. It accepts that all these county boroughs
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0563">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1035</span>
are coming in. The case rests upon the argument that East Grinstead's ties are to the south-east, and are not with Crawley or Gatwick. It is to be divided by a large new by-pass in connection with the M23 motorway complex, and I think the acquiescence—so far as there has been any—on the part of certain people in East Grinstead to the proposal to transfer to West Sussex will very shortly end, to be replaced by substantial opposition, in view of what the Minister said, emphasising that East Grinstead is part of the growth area, including the new town</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Development (Mr. Graham Page)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 563, in page 192, line 42, leave out paragraph 1.<br><br>
This Amendment is the first stage of two operations. The second operation is not yet shown on the Amendment Paper, but I shall need to refer to it for the purpose of this Amendment, and we shall introduce the second stage later on. The second half is intended to be dealt with by Government Amendment to Part IV. It is to simplify the provisions dealing with local government boundaries in the sea and in rivers.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) and I seem fated to discuss this matter. I remember that when we were dealing with factory farms and rating we discussed how farms could spread right across the Severn Estuary. Something of the same complications arise here. The boundaries in the sea</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1036</span>
<p>of Crawley, the urban district of Burgess Hill, Haywards Heath and Gatwick.</p>
<p>That is not the understanding of the people of East Grinstead, so I hope that we can discuss this matter further. The people of East Grinstead will certainly want to discuss it further when they realise the threat that hangs over their heads.</p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the Amendment be made:—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 4, Noes 17.</p>
<p>are a subject which, to a layman at least, are of well-nigh mediaeval complexity. Because this paragraph in the Schedule has stirred up a hornets' nest I had better put on record, at some length, what we intend to do.</p>
<p>The seaward extent of counties, and so on, was fully dealt with in the Ordnance Survey in 1962. Broadly, local government areas extend to the low-water mark, but certain waters have been recognised as parts of counties by decisions of the court. Specific decisions extend to Poole Harbour, Milford Haven, the Solent, the Humber and the Bristol Channel, but the precise areas to which they extend are uncertain. More generally, estuaries involved consideration of Section 27 of the Poor Law Amendment Act, 1868, which set out a number of provisions about accretions from the sea, whether natural or artificial, but quite failed to define, for example, where a river met the sea, and the sort of difficulty that arises in drawing a map.</p>
<p>It is those sort of things that we seek to put right in the Bill. We seek to define clearly the boundaries of the local authorities constituted under the Bill. We do not seek to have them defined in Committee or even on the Floor of the House. We intend to refer this matter to the Boundary Commission, on the same basis that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0564">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1037</span>
we are referring parish boundaries, and so on.</p>
<p>I do not envy the Commission its task. The law is in a dreadful state over the defining of a boundary, and the paragraph that we are seeking to remove and the provision that we shall insert later affect accretions from the sea. Fortunately, we are dealing with those matters in Clause 73. They will affect the provisions for the definition of waters which are contained in Coast Protection Acts and the Clean Rivers Acts; they will affect the provisions of an area of the sea which
<br><blockquote><p>"shall be deemed to be within a local authority area"</p></blockquote>
as it appears in certain Acts. They affect the provision relating to jetties, piers, and entrances to docks, and such cases as dealt with in the courts that I mentioned earlier—Poole Harbour and the rest.</p>
<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
<p>I hope that we can also clear up the difficult parts of the law which refer to "along the low-water mark" and "down to the low-water mark". Such phrases cause great difficulty in drawing ordnance surveys and defining the boundaries. For instance, Bristol is treated as being included in an area of the Bristol Channel extending to Flat Holme and Steep Holme.</p>
<p>Because we have introduced this paragraph into the Schedule the local authority associations have taken the line that the paragraph would exclude from local authority areas piers, harbours, marines and jetties, leaving the authorities unable to collect rates, apply public health provisions, acquire land, or police such areas, or to put out fires on them. I do not want that sort of doubt to remain, so we must be more specific in defining the boundaries. That is why I hope that the Boundary Commission will define the boundaries before the Act takes effect.</p>
<p>It is the intention of the Government that the boundary of England and Wales should be defined by the Boundary Commission where it falls in the sea, such as in the Dee or the Severn Estuary. We shall not be referring to the Boundary Commission the boundary between England and Scotland, because that does not come within the Bill. That just about covers the points that we wish to deal with in a later Amendment.<br><br>
This is really only a paving Amend-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1038</span>
ment, to remove an offensive paragraph. We did not think that it would be offensive, but local authorities have found it so. We want to put the matter right in detail by the help of the Boundary Commission.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the Minister in this paving Amendment to an unpayed road. As he says, he and I seem to have got into a lot of cold water over the months; this question always seems to arise. I am delighted that the Boundary Commission will have the matter referred to them; it needs to be referred.<br><br>
In view of the fact that the Minister is taking so strong a line about the boundary of the sea I have every hope that the time will come when I shall be able to convince him that this country is an island, and that the boundary of the sea is something strong and permanent, separating us from a large land mass about 21 miles away.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Sir Stephen, I am glad that you said what you did earlier, dissociating me from this Amendment because, unlike my right hon. Friend, I have some misgivings about it, in the light of the subsequent Amendments to which the Minister referred. I know that I must not discuss them in detail at this stage, but since the Minister referred to them I hope that you will allow me to consider this Amendment in the light of what the Minister said.<br><br>
I am concerned because he referred to the substantial legal problems involved in defining boundaries on the seaward side of counties. I agree that the Boundary Commission is the appropriate body to define the specific boundaries once the law has been tidied up, but I am rather concerned that in moving this Amendment the Government intend to put a heavy task on the Boundary Commission at a time between now and 1974. I think that the Minister said that he expected these boundaries to be defined by the time the Act comes into operation. To tidy up the whole of the law in this matter will put a heavy burden on the Commission at a time when it has many other problems to deal with.<br><br>
I wonder whether, when we come to look at the question in the light of the subsequent Amendments, the analysis of the law on the matter—as distinct from the definition of the boundaries once the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0565">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1039</span>
law has been tidied up—might not be felt to be something which could be better dealt with by the Law Commission or some similar body, rather than trying to put onto the Boundary Commission, which will be very heavily pressed simply to define the boundaries, the unravelling of what the Minister has referred to as a mess of law going back to the Middle Ages.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Laurance Reed</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) said that the sea was a boundary or barrier separating us from the Continent and, in particular, the Common Market. I should like to point out that we now share a common frontier beneath the sea with Germany, Norway, Holland, Belgium, France and Spain.<br><br>
With regard to the Amendment, I can see the need to rationalise the termination of local authority boundaries, since the present position is extraordinarily complicated. However, a neat and simple solution would be to allow the local authorities to draw their boundaries for planning purposes where territorial limits terminate. The ownership of the seabed could remain with the Crown Estate Commissioners for the purposes of revenue, but the planning of activity there—bearing in mind that in future years there is likely to be an increasing amount of activity on the sea floor—could be the responsibility of the local authority. The whole question of limits would then be successfully resolved. I cannot see that this is something which the Boundary Commission should look at, and I prefer the proposal of the hon. Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Cocks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to support the Minister in putting forward the Amendment, but I should like to point out that, whatever the deficiencies in other estuaries, in the Severn everything is very much "shipshape and Bristol fashion". There is no doubt at all where the boundaries of the port of Bristol Authority lie in the estuary; they are very clearly demarcated and, if the Minister's Department is in any doubts about the matter, I am sure that the local authority would be very pleased to assist.<br><br>
I welcome this move, however. I think that the matter should be cleared up and I am also touched by the Minister's concern to help the Ordnance Survey,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1040</span>
although I am not very clear from his remarks exactly what difficulties they face, since I have always understood that they take their data from Newlyn in Cornwall, so that it is not quite clear what point the Minister was making on that score.<br><br>
However, I hope that the Minister will recognise that, in supporting the Amendment, we in no way look forward to any disturbance of what have now become virtually the traditional rights of the Port of Bristol and the adjacent workings associated with it to have control over the navigable waters which are essential for entry into the harbour.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barry Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think it is wise to consider this matter. There was a time last year, after Questions in the House to the Minister's colleague, the Secretary of State for Wales, when we in Wales thought that there might be need for urgent and drastic action. I must point out that there is great concern in Wales that the boundary between England and Wales is not as clear as it had been thought to be. I think that it would be helpful to the Committee if I briefly indicated my worries.<br><br>
My constituency borders an estuary and it appears that we have a common boundary with Cheshire. Flintshire and Cheshire County Councils were and still are somewhat mystified as to where the boundary lies on the mudflats and marshes of the estuary. That is distinctly relevant, because it is likely that a barrage will soon be put across the Dec Estuary. That is particularly important to my constituency and to the local authorities within it, as to the County of Flint and Gwynedd and Clwyd, as it will be after the reorganisation of local government in Wales, since the rateable value is a very important matter.<br><br>
We have a large steelworks—the Shotton works of the British Steel Corporation—and it is likely that at some future date there will be considerable extensions to that works. Much of our prosperity in East Flintshire is based on the rateable value of the steelworks building. If the boundary were not to be—as Flintshire would require it to be—equitable and just, we can foresee much future revenue being diverted from us, and plans which we have for the development of the community could consequently fall by the wayside.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0566">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1041</span>
My point, therefore, is that I think it of great importance that the matter should be considered openly and in detail, in consultation with the local authorities concerned. The future of hundreds of thousands of people in the area of the Dee Estuary is at stake.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper) and with the hon. Member for Bolton, East (Mr. Laurance Reed). I do not object to what the Government are doing and I certainly agree that they should look at the question. I hope that it is not merely a question of asking the Boundary Commission to deal with the matter. It has become increasingly clear from the news received in recent months that the seashore, the foreshore and the area just out to sea are a most sensitive subject. Where there is any dispute between local authorities as to the area in which an area of sea or mudflat belongs, there is delay, and delay can be dangerous today when all sorts of things are being washed up, when there are underwater pipelines and when, in the near future, there may be exploration of the resources available so near our shores. It is a much greater problem than one merely for the Boundary Commission. The Commission is a very limited body which is doing a very limited job.<br><br>
Although I support the Minister's wish to look again at this, I hope that he will look beyond the question of boundaries to the tensions, dangers and responsibilities which are involved. The whole subject of the coastline urgently needs far greater investigation than can be given it by the Boundary Commission.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In reply to the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes), we are concerned here only with the boundary of local authorities as they will be set up under the Bill. Of course, there is the large problem of pollution from the sea, and so on, but that is not a matter for local government boundary decision at all. The Amendment raises only the simple point of finding some machinery whereby we can define the areas.<br><br>
I knew that when I started on such a complicated subject, I should get one or two things wrong and I should put them right with this second bite at the cherry. First, we shall have the sea and river
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1042</span>
boundaries of local authorities reviewed under the procedure in Section 62 of the Bill. However, as far as the boundary between England and Wales is concerned, that comes under Clause 64, which provides that the English and Welsh Commissions shall jointly decide that boundary. That, therefore, applies to the Dee. As to the point at which the review will be made by the Boundary Commission, I said far too definitely that it would be done before April, 1974. I must consult the Commission and see what work it has in hand; I think that it may not be before 1974. I do not wish to disturb the heavy workload which they have at present.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barry Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does that mean that the Minister cannot give a assurance today that he does not see any change in the boundary between.England and Wales in the future?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member tempts me. I believe that the boundary between Flintshire and Cheshire was decided by an Act of 1732—or perhaps not decided; I see that the hon. Gentleman expresses some doubt about it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It all belongs to Wales.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am getting into dreadfully hot water! All I can say it that, if necessary, this will be decided under Clause 64 of the Bill.<br><br>
All we are seeking to do in the Amendment is to remove a paragraph, and perhaps we shall have a chance to tidy up what we intend to do when we insert the fresh paragraph on the Amendment Paper.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 424, in page 192, line 47, leave out "mered" and insert "defined".<br><br>
In the end of Schedule 1, I came upon this word "mered". I was somewhat taken aback by this word and so I turned to the Oxford English Dictionary in order to find out its meaning. I discovered that "mered" was a word which was considered by the Oxford English Dictionary to be obscure except in dialect use. I assume that this is a dialect practised only in Marsham Street—Marsham Street-ese—which we are now having imported into the Local Government Bill.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0567">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1043</span>
But then I heard an even more uncharitable rumour which was that the hallmark of any good parliamentary draftsman was to include in any Bill at least one word known only to himself and unknown certainly to the lay reader, if not to the professional readership of the Bill. This was the word which, in this particular Statute, the parliamentary draftsman was including. If that is the ambition of every good parliamentary draftsman, I believe it is the duty of the Committee and every Member of the Committee to do what they can to make the Statutes we pass intelligible to the ordinary reader and even to the professional reader.<br><br>
In the light of that, I hope the Minister will be able to accept this Amendment, which seeks to substitue "defined" for "mered". If the Minister feels that "defined" does not give the technical, although archaic and obsolete, meaning which is given by "mered", he can find some alternative and satisfactory form of words conveying that meaning, but ones which will be intelligible to the normal reader.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will be heartened to hear that thousands—indeed, millions—of ordinary readers in posterity will be thumbing through the Local Government Reorganisation Bill. There is no limit.<br><br>
Those who do will immediately recognise this word "mered" as having been given statutory recognition in the Ordnance Survey Act, 1841, and they will immediately say, "Oh, that is all right because we know exactly what it means in those circumstances." It is, in fact, a very specific, technical word, which is well known to those who are affected by it, which mercifully, we can all agree, is a relatively small number of people. It is a particular skill which consists of taking the definitions which exist in the Bill which we are now deliberating and translating those definitions from the Act on to the ground. That is what the Ordnance Survey do. They do it with reference to the physical features on the ground. When they do it, they consult the local authorities so that there is no dispute as to the final decisions that they make.<br><br>
So that further definitions can be put before the Committee, it may be to their convenience to know that a "mere" is, in fact, a boundary and that a "meres-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1044</span>
man" is someone whose job it is to ascertain those boundaries. Finally, a "merestone" is a boundary stone.<br><br>
I hope the Committee will not feel that with that superfluous information I have in any way dampened my enthusiasm for asking the hon. Member to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to accept the definition of the 1841 Ordnance Survey Act. But there are very few uses of this word in the English language. Unfortunately, the Oxford English Dictionary, even in the whole 26 volume edition, does not give the definition which has been given by the Minister on this occasion. I hope that it will be possible for the Minister to think again about this, to try to find a form of words, such as "marking out land by means of boundaries", or some other form, which is clear and not something which is a word which, as far as I can see from the dictionary, has not been used since 1863.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member might have pleaded a quite unanswerable case for amending the Oxford English Dictionary, but not for an Amendment here.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
<p><i>Amendment made:</i> No. 150, in page 194, line 25, at end add—

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We now come to the Schedule as amended. I do not think there is any Bill which has gone through Standing Committee with a Schedule which has been so fully discussed as this one has been, and in the normal course of events I would put the question without further debate. But representations have been made to me that there are one or two points which Members would still like to make. On the understanding that we have only a short debate upon this Question, I shall now put the Question and open the debate.</span></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That this Schedule, as amended, be the First Schedule to the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Arthur Blenkinsop</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I propose to intervene only briefly, just to raise one point which I know is troubling some of our colleagues who have not been sitting

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1045</span>
on this Committee but who wish to raise matters relating to the Schedule that have not been discussed during our discussions in Committee.<br><br>
I ask the Minister to recognise the point that there are a number of cases that have been put to us, as Members of the Committee, that we have not felt it desirable to raise in the debates but which nevertheless we are quite sure the Members for those areas will wish to raise when the matter comes to the report stage.<br><br>
I have, for example, problems in connection with Tyneside. A question has been raised affecting an authority like Slough. These are all perfectly proper questions to raise, I ask the Minister to give an assurance that he understands that there are some matters which we have not sought to raise at this stage, and recognises the claim of our colleagues to seek to raise them at a later stage in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that many hon. Members who are not on the Committee would like to put their case for changes in the boundaries at this stage.<br><br>
Whenever any hon. or right hon. Member has approached me on this subject, I have urged him to enlist the services of someone on the Committee and to put the Amendments at this stage so that we might consider them at an early stage in the Bill.<br><br>
I shall be very happy to discuss any boundary Amendments which Members not on this Committee wish to raise at a later stage and it would be a great help if they would discuss them with me before Report. It may well be that we can shorten the Report stage by some earlier agreements.<br><br>
I am anxious that the general body of hon. Members and right hon. Members should not delay the Report stage by constituency points which it may well be possible to settle over the table, or in some other friendly way.<br><br>
It is not for me to consider what should be selected on Report, but I am sure the House would wish us to be discussing vital, essential and important points of the Bill rather than constituency matters. If we can settle any of those across the table before Report, I shall be only too happy to give every assistance I can.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leadbittcr</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have reconsidered

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I point out to hon. Members that the first two groups of Amendments selected deal with two aspects of the question of aldermen. The group headed by Amendment No. 564, in the name of the hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Maddan), deals with the inclusion of aldermen on councils and their mode of selection. The group headed by Amendment No. 528, in the name of the hon. Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper), deals solely with the question of nomenclature, and these Amendments would have the effect of renaming as "aldermen" the councillors of county councils.<br><br>
I hope that we can keep these issues, these two groups, clearly separated during the course of the debate.<br><br>
On the selection of Amendments in the group under Amendment No. 564, I have been asked to consider changing my selection, and allow Amendments Nos. 430 to 437, in the name of the hon. Member for Farnworth, as a separate debate. These Amendments relate exclusively to London, and I appreciate that the arguments may be rather different from those in the remainder of the No. 564 group. If that is generally convenient, we shall take Amendments Nos. 430 to 437 when we reach Schedule 2. Does that meet the pleasure of the Committee?</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maddan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must apologise for there being so many of them, Sir Stephen, but that is the length of the subject.<br><br>
We could not proceed without a debate on what is the oldest office and title in local government, but it is not in a backward-looking sense that I raise the matter at all. First, I should like to say, also, that this is not a partisan issue. If it had been, perhaps the matter would have been raised by the right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin). It is a matter on which we may all have our own opinions, and it is therefore right that we should express them.<br><br>
There is a matter of principle involved here, and it is whether, as is specifically provided for in the future of the London boroughs, there should be a body of people carrying over from one election to another, over an election period, who will bring their experience and the totality of their view, as opposed to a ward or a constituency view, to the affairs of the council.<br><br>
In putting these points, I want to emphasise that I am talking with the specific authorisation both of the County Councils Association and the Association of Municipal Corporations. What I have to say to the Committee is something that has some weight, not from my own words, but from the backing of those two bodies.<br><br>
As far as the detailed Amendments are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1050</span>
concerned, I do not intend to trouble the Committee, except to say that there is a small area of detail, which I shall come to in my speech, where the Association of Municipal Corporations would like to have some distinction made from the proposals which are on the Order Paper. These are not matters of principle at all.<br><br>
What is proposed in my Amendments, and agreed by the County Councils Association and the Association of Municipal Corporations, is that aldermen should be retained, that their numbers in any council should be reduced from the present one-third to one-sixth, that aldermen should only be selected from amongst council members who have been elected, and that they should retire at the age of 75, or not be eligible for election beyond the age of 75. Those three principles are at the heart of these Amendments.<br><br>
As far as the County Councils Association is concerned, they would like aldermen to be elected initially when the Bill comes into force for a period of six years, and at four year intervals thereafter, the election of aldermen coming in the mid-term of the four years life of a county council, therefore providing continuity, but not mixing up the election of aldermen with the high political spirit which may obtain immediately following an election.<br><br>
12.15 p.m.<br><br>
The Association of Municipal Corporations takes rather a different view, because the district councils have a different periodicity of elections. There are long Amendments giving effect on the Order Paper to what they have in mind. We have decided to take the Welsh Schedule at a later stage, and this has caused good progress to be made. That is the only reason why quite simple Amendments are not down on the Paper. As far as the Association of Municipal Corporations is concerned, and the district councils, they would like to see alderment, just like the County Councils Association, but they would like to see them elected—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I should draw the hon. Member's attention to the fact that the Welsh Amendments have been included with this group.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maddan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the Welsh Amendments. I am sorry; I meant the Welsh
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0571">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1051</span>
Schedule had been passed over.<br><br>
The Association of Municipal Corpora-lions would like aldermen to be elected for six years, with half of them retiring at three year intervals, and, with the system of elections that is now proposed for district councillors, that would have the effect of providing a suitable carryover period, a rather different sort from that proposed by the County Councils Association, because the election periods are rather different. With that one exception, that the County Councils Association and the Association of Municipal Corporations want to see this principle differently implemented, the two speak with one voice.<br><br>
It is said that the aldermanic system is undemocratic. It is said that, by having aldermen, the number of elected members whom it is effectively possible to have on a council is reduced, and it is said that too many people hang on to the office of alderman when their age may have entitled them to retire. These criticisms can be removed or minimised by the proposals in these Amendments. Aldermen provide a fund of experience; they concern themselves with the affairs of their county or district as a whole; and we must not cast away lightly and without further consideration the benefit that the aldermanic system has brought to the quality of local government. It is noteworthy that aldermen are specifically to be retained in Greater London.<br><br>
As for the criticisms that have been raised against the aldermanic system, it has been said that it is undemocratic. But these Amendments provide that aldermen may only be selected from those who have been elected. That is an attempt to move some way to meet that point. It has also been said that we can have too many aldermen. This proposal is that they should be reduced from one-third to one-sixth, so it attempts to meet that criticism.<br><br>
Thirdly, it said that aldermen may go on for too long. A retiring age of 75 is provided to meet that criticism, but I am sure we ail know that some aldermen who are over 76 are extremely spry and nimble and make a greal contribution to the affairs of authorities. I can think of one alderman in Hove. Nobody knows how old he is. He has been there for a long time. We think that he is over 75, but we should all be very sorry to see him
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1052</span>
leave the Hove council and the East Sussex County Council. Nevertheless, as the matter has been raised, I am sure it must be accepted that, it is proper to insert an age-limit in the Amendments as a general principle in an attempt to secure widespread approval for them.<br><br>
The district councils, because members are elected year by year, there is some built-in continuity, although the Association of Municipal Corporations thinks that the set-up would be greatly improved if there were aldermen, too. With unitary councils there is no in-built provision to secure the replacement of at least a few people with experience in local government of the area concerned. It is for those reasons that I commend the Amendments to the Committee. They are backed by the C.C.A. and the A.M.C., because the aldermanic system, with revisions, has a substantial contribution to offer to the future quality of local government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I supported the hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Maddan) in his Amendment to the Schedule but I am totally opposed to his proposal to retain the aldermanic system. There are many things in the Bill with which the Opposition do not agree. One of the few gems in the Bill, where I think the Government have shown some genuine courage in bringing local government up to date, is the abandonment of the ancient role of aldermen in the counties of this country I wish that their courage had been sufficient to enable them to take this a stage further and abolish the office of alderman in the Greater London boroughs.<br><br>
So far as I understand it, the office of alderman arose in the 1830s when, for the first time, this new-fangled idea of democracy was tried in the local authorities. Prior to that, local government had been in the hands of the county justices who held office for a long time. There was great danger, it was thought at the time, in having elections and allowing people to choose councillors, to choose people to sit on municipal bodies for a comparatively short period of time, that anarchy might result in the changeover between inexperienced people and the old, staid, tried, trusted county justices. The office of alderman, to some extent, compromised and fitted the bill, and therefore aldermen came to be retained in the local government system.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0572">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1053</span>
But then we created urban district councils and rural district councils. They do not have aldermen, and anarchy did not result from not having them. Indeed, when there are elections for those bodies the affairs of the area go smoothly on even when there is a complete, or almost complete, clean out on the council.<br><br>
Let us face realities in this Committee. Since those days when aldermen were created under the Municipal Corporations Act in the form in which we refer to them, party politics have, rightly or wrongly, entered into the system of local government. I think that both sides of the Committee are guilty of this. That was shown in 1967 and 1968 when we were suffering reverses. Aldermen can be appointed to frustrate the wishes of the electorate, clearly declared at an election, when they vote, not so much for individuals, as for parties.<br><br>
They vote one or the other party in, and the losing party clings to control by a few aldermen who are able to sit there for a number of years until the next aldermanic elections, and the winning party can clean them out again. It is a most undemocratic form of procedure. That is my basic objection to the aldermanic system. It does not face the realities of politics and local government as local government is today. This is not just a Labour member of the Committee saying the Tory alderman cling on to office and stop us getting control of authorities. It happens the other way, I am ashamed to say, and it did happen the other way in 1967 and 1968.<br><br>
I am not surprised that the C.C.A. and the A.M.C support the hon. Gentleman's proposal, but I should like to see their constitutions. I imagine that two-thirds, or three-quarters, of them are not councillors, but aldermen, and that the aldermen are trying to preserve the dignity of their title as aldermen and carry on with this traditional office even though the County Councils Association, by its reduction of the status of aldermen, admits that, in this day and age, and in a democratic society, the need of the role of the alderman has gone. They are saying, "Please do not kill us altogether. We will reduce our powers and our members. We will try an age limit. We will do something or other as long as this status and title is retained". I do not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1054</span>
think there is any case for its being retained.<br><br>
I think that the Government are right to say that the office of alderman is no longer necessary. Urban and rural districts have survived very well, indeed, without aldermen, and today we need more and more to make process of democracy clearly seen by the electorate. The wishes of the electorate can be, and often are, frustrated by the office of alderman. I am sure that most of my Friends will support the Government's proposal to abolish the office of alderman in England and Wales, and I think that most of us would be delighted if the hon. Gentleman was prepared to amend the Bill and abolish aldermen in London, too.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Janet Fookes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I share the view of the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) that an important principle is involved here. I do not wish, under any circumstances, to retain aldermen. Perhaps it is because I have known a good many aldermen, but I feel that when there is a change of political office, as very often there is, it is wholly undesirable that the balance of the council should be altered by the simple manipulation which takes place. I think that on those grounds alone the system should now be altered completely.<br><br>
I also see certain difficulties if the restrictions which have been suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Maddan) is implemented. As I understand it, he would not allow them to be aldermen after the age of 75, but am I right in my interpretation that there would be not such age limit for councillors? What, therefore, would be the position if a gentleman who had been thrown out as an alderman then offered himself for re-election as a councillor? That, surely, would be ludicrous, but it would be possible under the Bill.<br><br>
Further, I should like to see the office of aldermen abolished in London, too. It is wholly unacceptable to abolish it for the whole of England, except for Greater London. I believe the argument has been of use because, owing to the different ways of being elected—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must ask the hon. Lady not to go into the question of London, because that will be dealt with in a later Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Fookes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, Sir Stephen.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0573">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1055</span>
I shall therefore say that I am opposed to the Amendment, and sit down.</span></p>
<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is very pleasant, as the only Londoner on this side of the Committee, to join the hon. Lady, the Member for Merton and Morden (Miss Fookes), the only Londoner on that side of the Committee, in total agreement. The case against aldermen has been so well put by my hon. Friend the Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) and by the hon. Lady that there is really very little more to be said. I think-that it was my right hon. Friend the Member for Fulham (Mr. Michael Stewart) who once said that in questions of belief there were two possible categories: there were "yes" questions and "yes-ish" questions; "yes-ish" ones did not matter very much, but for "yes" ones people were prepared to go to the last ditch. As far as I am concerned—and I think that this is true for most, if not all, of my hon. Friends—this is a "yes" issue. The hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Maddan), who is a very fair hon. Member, could not put a very constructive case for the retention of aldermen. He put forward a case in the hope of appeasing those who were against aldermen.<br><br>
There is a great difference between those two possible cases, and that sort of case really gives the game away right from the start. The hon. Lady dealt brilliantly and effectively with the age question. I thought that the hon. Member for Hove dealt with it rather well himself, with his ageless councillor who seemed to go on and on, almost longer than Hove itself. It reminded one of "1066 and All That", which, as so often, gives the truth in a very simple statement. Talking about the old office of the alderman, it says:<br><br>
"Four and twenty eaoldormen.<br><br>
Too eaold to die."<br><br>
That seems to be true about aldermen; they do go on for ever and ever.<br><br>
The basic question is the democratic one. If we want local government to be local democracy, we cannot have unelected members of the council. It is as simple as that.<br><br>
There is one minor difficulty which I hope the Under-Secretary of State will bear in mind. I do not want the hon. Gentleman to reply to this. I mentioned it on Second Reading, and it may be that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1056</span>
the matter will arise later in another group of Amendments. I said then:
<br><blockquote><p>"The right hon. Gentleman mentioned aldermen, and we approve of their abolition…. But the coupling of a four year term of office with the all-out election procedure in county councils could give rise to a situation … when there would be no continuing members at all in a local authority in a year of a big swing."—[OFFICIAL REPORT. 16th November, 1971; Vol. 826, <i>c.</i> 250.]</p></blockquote>
I do not think, as the hon. Gentleman the Member for Hove does, that that is an argument in favour of aldermen, but perhaps it is an argument in favour of considering how one might avoid the problem during elections. I hope that when the Under-Secretary of State replies he will be as firm as the Secretary of State was on Second Reading.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fergus Montgomery</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Maddan) on this occasion. I have to support my hon. Friend the Member for Merton and Morden (Miss Fookes), the right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) and the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes).<br><br>
It is true that at one stage to become an alderman on a council was a great honour, and certainly one of the reasons—as the hon. Member for Widnes mentioned—was that it gave continuity to a council. If the aldermanic seats on councils were shared fairly between the parties, I should be inclined to agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Hove, but we all know that politics is now very much involved in local government and that political parties—I believe that all parties are guilty of this, even the Liberal Party in certain parts of the country where it has control—use their majority on the council in order to take the aldermanic seats.<br><br>
The hon. Member for South Shields (Mr. Blcnkinsop) is as aware as I am, I am sure, that in 1961, when the Labour Party gained control of Newcastle, a lot of very good people who were Tory aldermen were sloughed off. In 1967, when the Conservatives regained control, a lot of very good people who had given valiant service on behalf of the Labour Party were sloughed off.<br><br>
I could never understand why councillors who had safe seats on the council ever aspired to be aldermen, because with the swing of the political pendulum they could be swept off the aldermanic bench. whereas, by representing a safe ward, pro-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0574">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1057</span>
viding that they did their job well, they were assured of staying on the council for a considerable time.<br><br>
Unfortunately, the aldermanic system has been used undemocratically by the party in power in order to thwart the wish of the electorate. There are examples in the country today where the local will has been one way, but, because of the aldermanic system, a party has stayed in power when it has been perfectly clear that the wishes of the electorate are the other way.<br><br>
I hope that my hon. Friend will reject the Amendment, because I agree the aldermanic system has very little to commend it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Muate</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to make a few brief points. It is still true to say, despite what my hon. Friend the Member for Brierley Hill (Mr. Montgomery) has just said, that there are many people who find it a matter of great pride to be an alderman of their town or borough. Although, broadly, I am in agreement with the Bill on this point, I am hopeful that we shall still find some means of using the term "alderman", certainly in the honorary capacity, as a means of conferring a dignity on many people who value it highly. Nevertheless, I go along with what has been said.<br><br>
Referring to a remark of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) I agree that on occasions councils have been virtually totally changed. I think that the second G.L.C. elections were a case in point. In some boroughs there was virtually a total changeover, much to the consternation and horror of a large number of candidates who found themselves with very little experience, having to man the important committees.<br><br>
I am sure that we shall all welcome the ending of the eternal party wrangling, the back-biting, the allegations and counter allegations that go with these elections when this aldermanic situation is eliminated. It will be good riddance to that, and also to the wretched business of the by-elections which follow the selection of aldermen from among the elected councillors. They usually take place at a time when the electors, the councillors and the agents do not want them, and as a result there are miserably low polls. We can say goodbye to that,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1058</span>
I hope, and therefore I support this part of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is almost unanimity on the Committee on this issue. The view expressed by the overwhelming majority of those who have taken part in the debate confirms the Government's judgment. The only slight doubt that I have arises on the argument put forward so pungently by my hon. Friend the Member for Merton and Morden (Miss Fookes), who argued that the best reason for getting rid of aldermen was that she knew so many of them. My only anxiety is that I have heard that argument applied to Members of Parliament, so I suggest that we should not call it in aid in this instance.<br><br>
The Maud Report on Management and the Redcliffe-Maud Royal Commission listed their objections to the aldermanic system. The arguments were forcibly deployed, and the Government substantially accepted them in the White Paper in which the decision to abolish aldermen was declared.<br><br>
There are four reasons why the aldermanic system should now be abolished. Many reasons have been given today, with which I personally agree, although I do not intend to add my comments to them. First, in this day and age, as we look forward to the reorganisation of local government, responsibility should lie—and should be seen to lie—with the directly elected representatives. That is the principle upon which the Government feel that it is necessary to take a firm view.<br><br>
One argument that is put forward is that this denies to local government the opportunity to have specially qualified people who can be brought on to the aldermanic bench. I have always been slightly worried about the argument that there are these mystical figures who should have a privileged contribution to make without doing the difficult, burdensome and hard work that other people in public life must do. One of the points of being in public life is that one should be responsive to the electorate. Many of us believe that we have some god-given talents to bestow upon the nation. It does us. no harm whatsoever every so often to have the prick of the nation in our bottom to be sure that we are doing what the nation wants. So there is a great
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0575">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1059</span>
argument for making sure that that is the case.<br><br>
We have provided in the Bill that where there is a specialist contribution on a relatively small scale to be brought forward to local service, then under Clause 101 people can be co-opted to the specialist committees of local authorities, and I think that is right.<br><br>
I hinted just now at my next reason, which is on the question of responsiveness to the electorate. I believe that it is extremely important that people in local and national government should be responsive to people to whom they are responsible. There is nothing that keeps one more in touch than the day-to-day contact, personally or through letters or the telephone, with the problems of the people. The knowledge that in the end we must answer to and justify ourselves to these people does a great deal of good in the way we reach our judgment.<br><br>
Finally, a point which adds to the argument along these lines is the party manoeuvring which goes on over aldermen. No one would deny that this is the case; it is precisely what one would do if one were administering the system oneself in a party political conflict. But I cannot believe that this docs anything but harm to politics or to the image of local government. The image of local government is something that we must be particularly concerned about. The point has been made, and we are all concerned, about the low level of turn-out and the general disregard for those of us who make a contribution in public life. This is particularly true of local authorities, and it is something which we must be careful to protect at all time and to see what we can do to enhance the reputation of those in local politics. The aldermanic manoeuvres go a long way to militate against that.<br><br>
For those four reasons, I would say to my hon. Friend that despite the heavy weight of authorities which he is able to quote on this side, the Government feel that this is a matter of principle on which they would have to stand firm.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As you pointed out earlier in the proceedings of the Committee, Sir Stephen, this Amendment has a different function from that of the last group of Amendments which we have discussed. Its function, as you pointed out, is to change the nomenclature of the elected members of county councils in the new system of local government, so that the people at this stage of the Bill referred to as county councillors, the elected representatives, would be called aldermen. That is, a county council would be made up purely of aldermen; district councils would be made up of councillors. This is, therefore, not the same argument as that which was adduced by the hon. Member
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1062</span>
for Hove (Mr. Maddan) in his last Amendment. It is a rather different one which attempts to make clear to the public the difference between the two spheres of local government which will be created under the Bill.<br><br>
12.45 p.m.<br><br>
I should point out, perhaps, that this is not a partisan matter by any means. As the Minister will be aware, this Amendment was suggested to me by a local councillor in my constituency, belonging to the Conservative Party. It seems to me that it has considerable value in a situation where there will be a great, deal of confusion among the public about the new system of local government which we are introducing.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary, in replying to an earlier Amendment of mine, suggested that millions of people might not read the Local Government Bill. I suggest that millions of people will be confused by the results of the Bill. This will be particularly true in the former county boroughs in non-metropolitan districts which previously had a unitary authority, when one had to go and see one's councillor about a whole range of local government functions. Now, under the provisions in later Clauses of the Bill, one will have to go and see one's county councillor on certain functions and one's district councillor on other matters.<br><br>
It might aid the public—and I think that our objective is to ensure that local government is clear and understandable to the public—if, in that sort of situation—and I am referring here to the non-metropolitan counties rather than the metropolitan counties where the division is slightly different—someone who wanted to raise an education matter, or a social service matter, knew that it was Alderman so-and-so who dealt with the matter rather than Councillor so-and-so. There could be some confusion there.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Montgomery</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can see a great deal to commend itself in what the hon. Member is saying, but what would be the position where a man elected for a district council was at the same time a member of the county council, so that he would be an alderman on the county council, according to the hon. Gentleman, and a councillor on the district council? Would not that also cause confusion?</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1063</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Given the size of the new authorities, and the amount of work they will have to do, I am not sure whether, as it has been possible in the past, people will be able to serve on two authorities. One of the things which concerns me is where we shall find people who will have the time to serve on the new county councils, let alone serve both on the county council and the district council. But I admit that if there are any of these supermen, or people who have all the time in the world and are able to serve on both the county authority and the district authority, the confusion which has been suggested by the hon. Member for Brierley Hill (Mr. Montgomery) could arise.<br><br>
I am trying to deal with the broad generality of things and to help the public by distinguishing between the different functions of the new county authorities and the district authorities, by making it quite clear that if people who are called "aldermen" serve on the committees which are responsible for a function administered by the—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moate</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon Member consider the criticism that that might increase confusion. People would not know to which council an alderman related, whereas the position is clear if they know that he is a county councillor or a district councillor. Nothing surely could be clearer than that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The matter is clear to to people who have lived outside the county boroughs. The confusion will arise in those areas which have had unitary authorities in the county boroughs up to now, and people have just gone to see their councillor about something.<br><br>
In the future, certain subjects will be administered by district councillors, although I suspect that the name "district councillor" will not come into general use, while other things will be administered by county councillors. I am suggesting in this group of Amendments that we would clarify the situation for the public if it were made clear that those who were serving on the county authority and were responsible for the county services were to be given the name of "alderman". For those who have an antiquarian interest, I suppose it would satisfy a desire to maintain a long-standing term in English local government in the parlance of the day, but that is not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1064</span>
the main purpose in moving this Amendment. It is in order to provide to the electorate a rather clearer idea of what different people's functions were.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cormack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not want to detain the Committee for long. I wanted to be here, and I was sorry I was not, to take part in the previous debate. I should certainly have spoken in favour of the Amendment to retain aldermen. But there we are, it has gone. I am a good democrat, as I hope everybody on this Committee is. I accept the fact that it has gone, although I rather mourn its passing.<br><br>
I am rather attracted by the idea very ably put forward by the hon. Gentleman opposite. It has a great deal to commend it. Not all my reasons for supporting it would necessarily commend themselves to him, but I rather like the idea of retaining an ancient and splendid title, and it would distinguish between the members of the first-tier and second-tier authority.<br><br>
In whatever system we have there is bound to be some evidence of confusion in the minds of the public. There is bound to be a transitional period of confusion, whatever happens, but I should have thought that after a three- or even four-year, period it would not be confusing; that it would be known that an alderman was a member of the first-tier authority and a councillor a member of the second-tier authority. The idea has a great deal to commend it. I give it my support and express the hope that my hon. Friends on the front bench will not throw it out at this stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Anything that brings a certain clarity to the new authorities and the distinction between them is to be welcomed. This is an ingenious attempt to add to the general public awareness of the differences. I think, however, that there are problems about it. I want to deal with some of the points that have been raised.<br><br>
First, the hon. Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper) faced the fact that this confusion is much more likely to come in the existing county boroughs rather than in the counties, where overlapping is a well-understood situation. There are county councillors, rural district councillors and parish councillors already. My hon. Friend the Member for Brierley Hill (Mr. Montgomery) raised the question of the confusion arising from a person's being both an alderman and a councillor.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0578">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1065</span>
That would be quite possible under the present system. But, on balance, I think that the arguments are the other way.<br><br>
First, it would mean that we could not proceed with our plans, as outlined later in the Bill, to give the title of honorary alderman to those who had made a special contribution. We see this as being a rather distinguished and rare honour but, nevertheless, one that has a certain historical continuity and attraction. That would not be possible if we adopted these Amendments.<br><br>
There is another and much more serious argument. If we were to make county councillors aldermen and district councillors councillors, in the minds of everyone in local government today there would be an immediate assumption that one was superior to the other—because the aldermen are now the father figures, or the senior figures, of local authority administration. We have tried to stress our view that the two new authorities are complementary and have differing functions, but are on a level. It would be very regrettable if we were to give the impression that we have now changed our minds—that the father figures were moving on to the counties and that everybody else would have to make do at district level. That is not the way we see it.<br><br>
There are areas in which some of the confusion in county boroughs could be eliminated by practical working together. The sort of examples which would obviously make it much easier to avoid some of the confusion in people's minds are joint surgeries. In many cases the areas will be represented by people from the same party, both at district and at county level. I imagine that that will be the case—not always, but to a great extent.<br><br>
I feel that if someone has a problem—whether it be on housing, or planning, or something else—he does not immediately say, "That is for Alderman So-and-so" or "That is for Councillor So-and-so", because all surveys show that nobody knows the names of his local authority people. Indeed, when confronted with problems of almost any sort many people do not initially know where to go. First, they say, "I have a problem here,"—social services, planning, housing, or whatever it may be—"Who do I turn to?" They are directed to their local authority offices, their Member of Parli-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1066</span>
ment, their local councillors, or whoever it may be. They are commonly misdirected, but they get the right advice, or are forwarded on to the right person, at the second attempt.<br><br>
That is very much what will happen. There is no way in which we can overcome this problem when the new authorities come into existence. I hope, therefore, that the confusion will not be real. Regrettably people will still have the same problems. They will still seek advice as to where the experts are, and at the second remove they will probably get the right advice.<br><br>
There is no overwhelming argument for the Amendment. For me, the overwhelming argument must be that there is equality between the councils, and not a superiority of one over the other.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The two major points which the Under-Secretary made were, first, the case for honorary aldermen, which are referred to later in the Bill on which I have no consequential Amendment in this group of Amendments. I agree that that is a problem. It could be dealt with by councils changing their attitude towards the use of the power to create honorary freemen. This two-tier set-up of honorary people—honorary aldermen and honorary freemen—may not be a satisfactory one for a local authority. It might be better to have one position which the local authority could create, but that point can be dealt with on the appropriate Clause.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary's second point, which I tried to avoid raising in moving the Amendments—the question of two spheres of a parallel nature, or two tiers of local government—is rather more substantial. We are anxious to ensure that county councils should not be considered to be an upper tier, dominating the strong districts that are to be created in many parts of the country.<br><br>
In view of the particular points made by the Minister, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the Minister feels that this would be an appropriate time to adjourn.</span></p>
<p>Further consideration adjourned—[<i>Mr. Graham Page.</i>]</p>
<p><i>Adjourned at three minutes to One o'clock till this day at half-past Four o'clock.</i></p>
