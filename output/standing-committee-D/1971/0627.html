</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we adjourned last Thursday I had just completed a quotation from a letter I had received from a constituency outside West Fife. I will send it on to the Minister and will inform the constituency member so that he can reply direct. It is about the plight of widows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the Committee will bear with me while I quote briefly from two other letters in similar terms. One is from Motherwell and the other from Glasgow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The letter from Motherwell is about an old-age pensioner.
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am an O.A.P. and my total income would have been £10 a week, but I have to take part-time work which I received £7.50 for. Now £10 would keep you but nothing else, so hence the reason for taking part-time work. The Income Tax claim £2.25 per week, which I think is ridiculous after serving the country for 53½ years … why not get the income tax done away with for O.A.P.s and give us a better standard of living."</p></blockquote>
I think we have all had letters asking that the pension be tax-free, but that is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>226</span>
not a matter for this Committee; therefore, I am not pursuing it. The gentleman continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We were supposed to receive £1 back in Income Tax at the beginning of the new tax year. This was just a lot of bluff."</p></blockquote>
The letter from Glasgow is from a lady who says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am 65 years of age. From the age of 14 I worked till I married at 30 years, paying the contributions of that time. For the past 16 years I have worked as a part-time auxiliary nurse, night and day duty. I had to retire in February of this year to look after my husband who was given an early retirement on his health. So I think you will agree this is a record for all these years of working. For all these years of working I have had the handsome sum of 3p. per week. To be collected monthly at my local post office and the usual penalties if I give any false information. I am enclosing the notice."</p></blockquote>
She gets 3p per week graduated pension which she has to collect each month at the post office. She says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It has to be seen to be believed. You could show it to Mr. Heath if you like."</p></blockquote>
Much good that would do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quote those letters to show the plight of the kind of people about whom we are talking in these Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now wish to turn to the Minister's main argument for rejecting the Amendments—the cost. It is always a powerful argument against doing anything. If the will is there, the means can be found. The will is not there to do more than we have done in the Bill. The means are there, but the will is not; that is a political judgment that the Government have made. The means that I am about to suggest may not please the Government and their friends; but, before I turn to that, I want to rebut some of the Minister's arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, he was castigating my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Meacher) when he compared the weekly tax concession of £1 all round with the 75p that was to be given to the old people. He said that it was not a fair comparison; it was not comparing like with like. In one sense, he is right: the £1 a week concession was given in the first week in May, but the 75p will be given in the first week in October. He did not mention that difference—a vital difference to the poorer sections of our community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He said also that part of that £1 would be paid back in increased contributions to pay for the increase in pensions. That is true, but it can be used by the Government to justify, for example, even in the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0685">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>227</span>
1971 Budget, giving Lord Stokes, the head of British Leyland, an extra £67 a week tax concession on the grounds that he might be paying a little of that back to give the old-age pensioners 75p or whatever they have had in total since 1971. Mr. John Clark of Plessey had an extra £124 a week in the 1971 Budget; some of that, no doubt, will go to the pensioners; and Sir Peter Allen of I.C.I. had an additional £100 a week in tax concession. That is why I have repeated and will go on repeating the kind of society that has been created over the last two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister then went on to detail the cuts in taxation which the Government had made since taking office, and pointed out with great self-satisfaction that they had taken 2¾ million people out of the tax brackets altogether. How many of those have gone back since? How many miners have gone back; how many railwaymen? As inflation goes on, a large number of the people who were taken out of the tax brackets will probably be back by now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, the Minister should have painted the whole picture—I took the figures from the Library—the whole picture of the give-aways and the take-backs. The give-aways were given to different people from those from whom it was taken away. The public services, clearly, had to be cut; if we cut taxation by £3,000 million, then of course we must cut back in other ways. We must cut the public services or increase charges, which amounts to the same thing. A sum of £35 million, for instance, was clawed back by the abolition of cheap welfare milk; £52 million from the increased dental and prescription charges; £38 million from increased charges for school meals; £9 million from the abolition of free milk for children from 7 to 11; £100 million to £200 million to be saved on housing subsidies; all that has to be set against the tax concessions about which the Minister boasted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One final word on the costs of the Amendments. The Minister's figures were £800 million gross, about £700 million net. He was not quite sure; he was fairly vague about it. What is £100 million here or there? It sounds a lot of money; it is a lot of money. But when the Minister gave those figures I had the 	<i>Guardian</i> of last Thursday by my side. We are to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>228</span>
spend £2 million on a refit of the Royal Yacht "Britannia".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We knew that would come!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course. Is the hon. Gentleman arguing that is a bagatelle? The Government have pushed a separate Bill through the House of Lords, and it is to come to the Commons, so the Leader of the House says, to get £1 million by putting museum charges on for the first time in the history of the country. A whole Bill is to come in front of the House to collect £1 million from old-age pensioners, from children and the rest. This is the kind of society we are talking about in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had a letter about the "Britannia", one of many:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am an Old Age Pensioner—and I just had to sit down and drop you a line—"</p></blockquote>
and I know how she felt—
	<br><blockquote><p>"for, the enclosed article which appeared in the 	<i>Daily Express</i> this morning on he front page … just about 'turned my stomach'. Before I proceed further, let me congratulate you on your persistent 'stand' against The Royal Family and the Monarchy in general—for I think and hope that '	<i>that institution'</i> is on the way out—and the sooner the better!! What happened to the recent clamour by the 'moneyed-people' to increase the Queen's salary?"</p></blockquote>
I shall not go on any further, except to compare that with another extract from, I think, a Sunday newspaper; I have not even the date. It is from "Conroy's Casebook". It looks like an article in the 	<i>News of the World</i> or 	<i>The People.</i> It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Welfare State is designed to look after people in need—but does it? A survey published a few days ago by Age Concern revealed that one third of the elderly people interviewed suffered from lack of heating.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Miss Christina Macleod would at first appear to be one of the lucky ones. She lives in a modern two apartment centrally-heated flat in the Maryhill district of Glasgow.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Problem is that the central heating has been cut off for two of the three years Miss Macleod has lived there.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>She explained: 'For the first year the heating did not work properly. When the workmen came to fix it I told them to switch off as I couldn't afford the bills.'</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Miss MacLeod, who admits to being in her seventies, receives £9.25 a week in pension and supplementary benefits.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>From this she has to pay £12.77 a month in rent and rates which does not leave much to spend on luxuries.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Miss Macleod contacted the Casebook after
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0686">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>229</span>
reading in the Record that elderly people could qualify for a heating allowance."</p></blockquote>
It goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The heating allowance is not automatic, but is paid by the Department of Health and Social Security in cases where they feel an extra allowance is required.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The maximum allowance is 75p a week, but fewer than 200,000 of our 7,500,000 pensioners receive the allowance.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Paul Dean, Parliamentary Under Secretary for Health and Social Security assured me during a visit to Scotland earlier this year that social security officials would study elderly people's files to see if they required this allowance."</p></blockquote>
This is what these people are undergoing, and that is what we are spending the money on—£2 million on the Royal yacht, and old folk dying because they cannot get adequate heating. I submit to the Committee that this is indefensible, and it is not good enough for the Minister to put up his Aunt Sallies and then proceed to knock them down like a Bisley marksman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He must assume that under the Bill—and I do not blame him for it—we shall finance social security by a tripartite contribution: Exchequer, employers and employees. I do not accept that. There is nothing immutable about the way in which we finance social security. It is for Government to decide how we shall finance it. There is nothing sacrosanct about the Exchequer contribution, the employers' contribution or the employees' contribution. Nor, indeed, is there anything sacrosanct about the upper income limit of £48 within the graduated scheme. I can speak only for myself in these matters. I do not know what my party's official policy will be at the next election, but I hope that it will be this. I hope that when my right hon. Friend speaks she will give us some indication of what is taking place in the discussions within our policy-making bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must state my approach in broad principle to this question. Social Security must be seen and must be used as a basic medium for redistributing wealth as between one set of people and another and not as a means of redistributing income as between one group of workers and another. It must be used increasingly as a weapon by the Government in the Government armoury to eliminate, or at least to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>230</span>
redress, the gross imbalance and unfairness in wealth distribution in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister talked about £700 million as being the net cost of all our Amendments. That is less than 2 per cent. of the gross national product. A flat-rate wealth tax of 3 per cent. on personal wealth of over £50,000 would yield about £1,000 million a year. That is the kind of approach I should like to see adopted by my party. If the Conservative Government can operate the fiscal machine and social security services in the way they have done to benefit mainly the wealthier people and to give a few crumbs of comfort to the poorer, we as a party must be firmly committed in the opposite direction. Being a party that believes increasingly in more egalitarianism, this is the kind of approach—the only approach—which will ensure that the old, the widowed, the sick and the people we are talking about in the Bill will have the fair deal we have all said they are entitled to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have spoken at considerable length already and I shall therefore be extremely brief. I should like to make three or four quick points. They all relate to the fact that the Under-Secretary in his speech did not answer several of the points made. I hope that he will rise before we conclude this debate to say a little more about the real nub of the argument which he has still missed out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, he said nothing at all about the argument that, if this country enters the EEC on 1st January next year, the effect of VAT on the lowest income groups and particularly on the elderly is known, on the basis of independent calculations by the Trade Policy Research Centre, to be considerable. How far are these reasonably supposed to be taken into account in this pension increase? Will he address himself to that point?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, he said nothing about the question of alternative concessions and their sheer meanness in range, numbers covered and in the size of the concessions. How can he argue that a pension increase of this kind is adequate in the light of those facts?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Above all, I should like to draw attention to the crucial question which he made no attempt to answer and which is the whole nub of the argument: what is an adequate pension? What does he regard as an adequate or sufficient pension? Since GNP has doubled in this

country since 1948, is he still saying that the best we can afford is one-fifth of the national average earnings for a single person? Is that his argument? He himself referred, in the penultimate sentence of his speech, to "political auctioneering"—a very cynical smear word, if I may say so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Health and Social Security (Mr. Paul Dean)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It came from the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully realise, that this is a quotation taken out of context, using quite a different context from that in which my hon. Friend used the words. However, the use made of it by the Minister is very interesting, because he said, and he will regret these words—I shall make sure that he regrets these words, as I am sure several of my hon. Friends will—"That is, in effect, what we are dealing with in the Amendment." Is that the Minister's attitude towards a request to raise the pension to the still inadequate limits of £8 per week for a single person, which he calls "political auctioneering "? In his view, that is what is being dealt with in the Amendment. Is that his considered attitude? He will regret it if it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to draw attention again to this matter of social justice, which he made no attempt to answer. Whilst this Amendment was being discussed during the last Sitting, elsewhere it seemed proper to the Government to increase ten-fold the stock options available to the highest paid executives, by an Amendment which they themselves accepted to their own Finance Bill. [An hon. Member: "Hear, hear".] The hon. Gentleman says "Hear, hear". That just shows the extraordinarily unjust attitude on the Government side of the Committee. It means that senior paid directors will be eligible for stock options up to four times their total gross salary. That was introduced at the same time as the Government did not see fit to increase the still thoroughly inadequate pension for single persons from £6 to £8. I hope that the last word has not been heard from the Under-Secretary, and that he will repudiate the more cynical, thoroughly unsatisfactory and disgraceful comments which he has made about this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to speak through you, Mr. McAdden, but at the invitation of the hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. O'Malley) who devoted no less than two minutes of his speech beseeching me to join in the debate on a particular Amendment. It was a curious invitation because he then spoke for a further 45 minutes, thereby depriving me of the opportunity to speak on that Amendment. That is only one of the many examples of the ways in which willing the end without the means has characterised this debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before coming here, in my innocence, I imagined that the Committee stage of a Bill was where one escaped from the broad political propaganda, where one got down to some of the details, the nuts and bolts of legislation. When I helped a number of Conservative Members of Parliament with Amendments to Labour National Insurance Acts, I remember how those types of Amendment were made. If the Amendments made to the 1969 National Insurance Act are looked at, it will be found that there is an Amendment to increase the disregards for supplementary benefit, an Amendment to increase the earnings rule for widows' pensions and, of course, the most expensive of all, an attempt to increase a constant attendance allowance for the disabled, which was rejected by the then Government as being irresponsible, and the invention of the party which had just discovered the disabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember also that, at that time, all our Amendments had to be put through the Shadow Chancellor—the late Iain Macleod—who insisted that all of them should come within an overall budgetary total. That was a widely different approach from that which has been adopted by the Opposition today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I picked up the lengthy list of Amendments, with that experience in mind, I thought that going through them in great detail would take an enormous amount of time. I slowly began picking them off one by one, pencilling in the little figures. I then got the hang of it and went down the whole list putting them all in, but discovered to my surprise that they had left out a page—the contributions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Lady the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle) began her speech by saying that she would not be making

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>233</span>
any unrealistic demands for propaganda purposes. I wonder what she would sall a realistic demand? The hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton), despite the comments of the hon. Member for Oldham, let the cat out of the bag when he referred to the "political auctioneering" going on in this debate. It is true that later on he rightly retracted this, and said that any political party should be free to convince the electorate that it would do better. So it should; but only if it is prepared also to demonstrate how those increases and extra benefits are to be financed. Otherwise one is only practising a cruel deception on pensioners to imagine that there is an easy and painless way in which benefits can be increased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had various methods put forward for financing the increase in benefits. The hon. Member for Southall (Mr. Bidwell) suggested that it ought to be done through increased National Insurance contributions. That did not seem quite to agree with the ideas of the Member for Oldham, West; he was worried about the effect of higher national insurance contributions on the higher-paid worker. The hon. Member for Southall insisted that we on this side of the Committee did not know the working class or that the population was prepared to pay increased national insurance contributions to finance these benefits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sydney Bidwell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The substance of my argument, as I will again deploy it in moving my Amendment later on, was not that the increased cost of providing the benefits we have proposed should come solely from higher contributions from workers and employers, but that if there were a greater Exchequer contribution, workers would be prepared to pay their whack. I am quite convinced of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I, Sir Stephen, clear a point with you? It is the burden of the strong argument of the Government side of the Committee that we have not put down detailed Amendments as to how our proposals should be financed. Surely it is the case that we are greatly handicapped in a National Insurance Bill in making specific proposals increasing the Exchequer contribution? If so, I suggest that we could not practically get down to the task of apportioning the manner in which it might be financed in accordance with Labour Party policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>234</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call on Mr. Lamont, I will clear up this matter. I have sat in the Committee the whole time, as the hon. Member will know. I have not noticed any difficulty on the part of hon. Members in suggesting ways in which the matter might be resolved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member did not suggest that the increase should be financed purely out of increased contributions; nevertheless he said that they should pay their whack. It is surprising, in view of that, that they did not put down any Amendments to demonstrate how that should be done, if it is so politically easy to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether the ordinary working people of this country are quite as keen to pay increased contributions as the hon. Gentleman suggests. He referred to the speeches made by Mr. Jack Jones of the Transport and General Workers' Union, saying that they would pay increased contributions if the pensions were put up. It is a little strange that Mr. Jones is always making these noises, when he is so reluctant to put his own house in order and to pay decent pensions to retired officials of the Transport and General Workers' Union, who have been having a long running battle with him on this point. This comes from one of the richest trade unions in existence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember that at the time when the right hon. Member for Coventry, East (Mr. Crossman) produced his plan for increased pensions, necessitating vastly increased contributions, there was a letter—we have a lot of letters read out in this Committee—written by a steel worker to the 	<i>Observer</i> on 7th December, 1969, illustrating quite clearly what a number of people feel about increased contributions. He says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I have a pain in my neck from shaking my head at Mr. Crossman's Fabian tract … including his solemn intoning of 'reducing or postponing the spending power of those at work' as a necessary evil.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Where he gets the belief that those at work accept paying higher social security contributions with less hostility than higher taxes, I do not know.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>I work in steel and know more about industry and workers than Mr. Crossman and the Fabian Society put together and multiplied by 107. And although I know nowt of office workers, I can tell you that if Mr. Crossman expects any man to accept with anything less than naked rage the reducing or postponing of his spending power after a hard week shot-blasting, turning, milling, grinding, or operating

The hon. Member for Fife, West had a different solution to the question of how these benefits should be financed. He referred to the enormous amount of wealth that there was in the country, and in his first contribution to the debate he said that if only the Government could get their hands on that amount of wealth, vastly increased social security benefits could easily be financed. I should like to comment on that argument, both as a cost argument and in the general context of the social justice argument that has been advanced by the hon. Member for Fife, West and the hon. Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Meacher).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, West referred to the alleged fact that 10 per cent. of the adult population of this country owns 75 per cent. of the wealth. This is not a new statistic; it was reproduced in the Labour Party's midterm manifesto in a slightly different form. But it is clearly intended to be a statistic which shocks and which demonstrates that there is tremendous inequality of wealth in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe, for reasons which I will explain, that that statistic demonstrates this at all. It must be remembered that, apart from inheritance, capital is largely built up over a period of time, through saving. Capital is also usually vested in one particular person in a family. It is easy to underestimate the effect that this saving through time can have on the statistical expression of the distribution of wealth. If one assumed a society in which there was total equality of incomes, and no inheritance whatsoever, in which all capital had to be financed out of saving, and people saved at a constant rate through time, clearly one would not expect an old person to have the same wealth as somebody just starting to work. One could under-estimate the dramatic effect that this has on the mathematical distribution expression of the distribution of wealth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there was a society with total equal-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>236</span>
ity of incomes, saving at a constant rate, one would find that men over 55, comprising less than 15 per cent. of the population, would own 80 per cent. of the wealth of the country. One must look at the statistic in that context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Gentleman pursues his interruption, I have listened with interest to the speech of the hon. Gentleman, and, as I mentioned earlier in the proceedings, it is difficult to find anything which is out of order, because in advocating an increase of £6 per week all sorts of arguments can be adduced. I find nothing strictly out of order in what the hon. Gentleman is deducing in what is merely a philosophical argument. He is, however, inviting a lengthy reply which will extend the scope of the debate. While allusions are to be encouraged, I hope he will not take it too far because it will only prolong the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I just want to intervene briefly to say that nobody on this side of the Committee believes in a completely egalitarian society, nor would my proposal create one. I suggested 3 per cent. of personal wealth of over £50,000. If the hon. Gentleman thinks that will lead to egalitarianism, he had better do his sums again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. Gentleman must have misunderstood me. The point of my argument was not that the hon.

I was merely commenting on the figures that he was using; 10 per cent. of the population owns 75 per cent. of the wealth as a statistic to demonstrate inequality. I do not believe it for the reasons I have just adduced. If the hon. Member does not believe me, perhaps he would care to consult the writings of a member of his Shadow Cabinet, the right hon. Member for Grimsby (Mr. Crosland). In his optimistically entitled book "The Future of Socialism" he says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… we have now reached the point where further redistribution would make little difference to the standard of living of the masses; to make the rich less rich would not make the poor significantly less poor …"</p></blockquote>
I shall not digress too far from these Amendments but I want to reply to some of the figures which have been used in the debate, particularly by the hon. Member

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>237</span>
for Oldham, West, when he compared the amounts that have been given to various income groups by this Government at different times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Oldham, West has produced a number of statistics attempting to compare what has been given in various Budgets with this Bill on a 	<i>per capita</i> basis, dividing the total amount of the tax concession by the total number of people in a particular income group. I should have thought this a rather curious approach. He is suggesting that each tax concession should end up giving on a 	<i>per capita</i> basis precisely the same amount to each person. It is, of course, demonstrable that it is much easier to give the amount on a 	<i>per capita</i> basis to the very poor or to the very rich. To give a large 	<i>per capita</i> sum to the vast group in between is extremely expensive. It is, therefore, very misleading to present the statistics saying that one group has got this on a 	<i>per capita</i> basis and another group has that on a 	<i>per capita</i> basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trouble with the hon. Member's statistics is that they make him constantly change his ground. He is advancing the cause of a different income group at different times. At the end of 1971 the hon. Member for Oldham, West analysed in various features here and in articles the effects of the last National Insurance Bill, the mini-Budget of my right hon. Friend the Chancellor, and his first Budget. He came to the conclusion that the amounts which were distributed to different income groups largely favoured the very worst off. The largest single total—£400 million—went to those with incomes below £1,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If he looks at his article at the end of December, 1971, he will see that £400 million was the concession given to those with incomes below £1,000 as the result of all the measures taken by the Government. At that time the burden of the complaint of the hon. Member for Oldham, West was not that money was being channelled towards those who are the poorest but that the burden of paying for this was greatest on those in the middle income ranges, between £1,000 and £2,000. This year the Budget gave considerable relief to those groups—the raising of personal tax reliefs, and then the hon. Gentleman changes his ground again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just for a brief clari-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>238</span>
fication, I certainly drew attention to the fact that the 	<i>per capita</i> average amounts going to the various income groups in that article to which the hon. Gentleman is referring are infinitely greater for those earning over £5,000 than for those with incomes less than £1,000, purely for the reason that there are about 250,000 of the former and about 7,500,000 of the latter. What matters is what people receive individually.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course the hon. Gentleman did that. But what is the point of working out 	<i>per capita</i> figures from the National Insurance Bill, which are calculated on the Exchequer contribution divided by the number of the recipients, and ignoring entirely the remainder of the benefits which are financed through the National Insurance contributions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is all very well to say that the Exchequer contribution is the community's care for the needy; but so is the National Insurance scheme. Nobody really believes that it is an insurance scheme: it is a tax. To pretend that it is an insurance scheme is to pretend something that is manifestly untrue. The 	<i>per capita</i> figures that the hon. Gentleman has been producing are therefore extremely misleading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I say, the hon. Gentleman complained first that the burden that was being placed on the middle groups was too great. Now, when they have been given relief, he complains that the relief ought also to have been given on exactly the same 	<i>per capita</i> basis to the beneficiaries under the Bill. He suggests, for example, that the £1 a week given by the Chancellor ought to have been 80p a week. But we have not seen him opposing in the Chamber the £1 a week that has been given and it is strange that, if this is his attitude, he has been so reluctant to oppose the Chancellor's £1 a week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also produced a figure in his first contribution to the Committee of the amount given in tax reliefs to what he calls the top 1½ per cent. of the population. This is the figure he used at the first Sitting of the Committee and it is one that he has referred to several times during our proceedings. The top 1½ per cent. of the population are those earning over £5,000 a year, and the hon. Gentleman said that the Chancellor had given £350 million to them in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0691">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>239</span>
the first Budget under this Government. How does he arrive at that particular figure? As far as I can see, half of it is made up of cuts in corporation tax. What has a cut in corporation tax to do with the earnings of over £5,000? The answer to that, as the hon. Gentleman would argue, is that, because the number of people earning over £5,000 a year is 385,000, and because the number of people, according to him, who own 80 per cent. of British equities is 385,000, they must be one and the same group. The fallacies in this argument are surely obvious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, to attribute a cut in corporation tax to shareholders is a gross slur on the bargaining power of the trade unions. Second, it ignores the extent to which a cut in corporation tax would obviate the need for a firm to raise prices further. Third, it is based on the fallacy that 1½ per cent. of the population own 80 per cent. of British equities. They do not. The material which the hon. Gentleman used for this figure only suggests that 1½ per cent. of the population own 80 per cent. of equities that are privately owned. As less than half of British equities are privately owned, his estimate is clearly a grotesque exaggeration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Meacher</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that we are some little distance from the main point of the Amendment, but as I have been challenged on that figure—[Hon. Members: "Oh".]—I will gladly take the blame on this. I know exactly what the hon. Gentleman is referring to. The point is that that particular calculation—and he knows the source; he knows the Lydall and Tipping article from which it came—takes into account life pension funds. If he looks carefully at that article in the "Oxford Bulletin of Statistics" he will see that it does. The point is that it did not take into account discretionary trusts. There is no doubt that discretionary trusts are considerably more concentrated on the very highest group within the wealthy; and this certainly tips the balance of calculation in that direction which, to a large degree, compensates for the difference. I accept that certain funds were left out of the calculation: I know it is imprecise, but they are the best available data, and certainly not far off.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Member for Kingston-upon-Thames (Mr. Norman Lamont) resumes his speech, may I say that this illustrates the difficulty in which the Chair finds itself from time to time. I am sure that a great deal of what the hon. Gentleman is saying is far away from the Amendment we are supposed to be discussing. On the other hand, as I understand it, he is replying in some detail to the speech which was made by the hon. Member for Oldham, West, (Mr. Meacher); and, that hon. Gentleman having introduced the arguments, I cannot very well call the hon. Member to order when he seeks to reply to them.

But it will perhaps serve to remind the Committee how important it is to try to keep to the Amendments, and not widen the discussion too far, otherwise we shall be here until the Recess starts.

While I am on my feet, in reply to the hon. Member for Southall (Mr. Bidwell), who raised a point with me, I confess that the answer I gave him was a time-saving one in order that I might advise myself more particularly upon the question. I am advised that it is perfectly in order to table Amendments on contributions, both by individuals and by the Exchequer—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Barbara Castle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By the Exchequer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, by the Exchequer. But I am not encouraging people to table Amendments. I am asked whether it is in order, and I answer the question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but this is important. We have had certain Amendments ruled out of order on the ground that they would put a burden on the Consolidated Fund, particularly in relation to attendance allowances which, as the hon. Gentleman knows, do not come out of the National Insurance Fund. Do we take it, therefore, that the Exchequer contribution to the National Insurance Fund does not fall on the Consolidated Fund, and therefore that we are all right? This is a rather confusing ruling, with respect, Sir Stephen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

of the hon. Member for Kingston-upon-Thames.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lamont</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the Committee will agree that, seeing that the hon. Member for Oldham, West has sought to advance the argument that his statistics did not take account of other things which could perhaps have been included, he is conceding that his statistics as presented in that argument grossly exaggerate the tax relief given to surtax payers in the first Budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then, having arrived at a total which I should say was roughly double the real amount that was given away to surtax payers in that Budget, the hon. Gentleman divided the total number of benefits by a figure of 250,000 people. Why 250,000, when he knows perfectly well that the number of people with incomes above £5,000 a year is now, according to the latest figures, 385,000? I know that the hon. Gentleman knows that figure, as he had it in a Written Answer the other day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had the same cavalier approach, the same statistical fantasies, when the hon. Gentleman got down to his calculations of how the National Insurance pension had been eroded by inflation. He started off by comparing like with unlike. It has been pointed out several times in the debate already that it is unfair to compare an increased National Insurance benefit with one immediately before another increase. He might well have looked at the effect of inflation on the 50p increase of the Labour Government in 1969, which did not make up the loss in purchasing power in the two previous years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Disregarding that fact, the hon. Gentleman, when presented with the unfairness of that comparison, said that it did not matter. I think the phrase he used was: "One can take different 	<i>points d'appui;</i> one will always come out with the same result in the end". But one does not; and. if one works through the calculations from a midway point, as he suggested, it produces an extremely different result, and demonstrates a real increase in the purchasing power of the pension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I think the hon. Gentleman's cavalier methods can actually be illustrated if one goes through his calculations point by point. He started with deducting the 16 per cent. inflation between 1969 and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>242</span>
1971—fair enough—getting the value of the pension down to £4.20. It then received a boost of £1, taking it up to £5.20. He then said that it was necessary to calculate the inflation for the period to this coming October—fair enough—and that one would assume that the rate of inflation would be between 8 per cent. or 10 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure how he arrives at that particular estimate, as one surely must distinguish between inflation touching in one month an annual rate of 8 per cent. or 10 per cent., and actually being 8 per cent. or 10 per cent. over the 12 months leading up to this coming October. Even if by an inconceivable stretch of the imagination the rate of inflation is 8 per cent. or 10 per cent. over the year to this October, what is the point in the hon. Gentleman stating in his calculations that he is assuming a rate of inflation of 8 per cent. or 10 per cent. when, in fact, his calculations are based on an assumption of a rate of inflation of 10 per cent.? Normally if statisticians present a band of estimates, they make a higher and a lower estimate, or they use the mean—but not the hon. Gentleman. He says he is assuming 8 per cent. or 10 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then one goes on to the 75p increase given this year, bringing the pension back up to £5.45. Again the hon. Gentleman says that one must look ahead to the in flation which will happen in the year to 1973. He then said that the National In stitute had predicted a rate of inflation of between 7 per cent. and 10 per cent. It did not. It predicted a rate of 7.1 per cent. exactly. It said nothing about 7 per cent. to 10 per cent. What is the point of the hon. Gentleman saying that he is assuming a rate of 7 per cent. to 10 per cent.—which is not arguable on the basis of the National Institute—when again he does not assume 7 per cent. and 10 per cent., or halfway between 7 per cent. or 10 per cent.? For the purpose of his calcu lations he assumes a rate of inflation of 11 per cent. That is the only way to reach a figure of £4.85 at the end. Although the hon. Gentleman may protest about it, he has had to scratch and squeeze the figures in a manner that I regard as extremely questionable to arrive at his conclusion.

One could go on taking other examples from the hon. Member's statistical fantasies, but unfortunately it would require detaining the Committee as long as he

did. The poor have a perfectly good case without it being distorted grotesquely by the hon. Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Meacher). It is true that the two Budgets which we have had have made the rich better off, but to nothing like the extent that has been suggested by the hon. Member for Oldham, West. What is the point in making such gross distortions, unless it is the very existence of the rich, rather than the means of financing increases in welfare benefits, that annoys him, or unless it is to create a point of focus for envy?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reimposing the investment surcharge would not pay for the sort of increases that have been suggested today. Over the longer period, as the right hon. Member for Grimsby suggests, increases in welfare benefits will only be made possible through increased economic growth. Increased economic growth has been the purpose of the tax cuts, and in particular of the surtax cuts that have been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member may not agree with that as an objective, but there is no need to distort and caricature what has been done. The poor have a respectable case without it being distorted by the hon. Member. In a rather revealing remark, earlier in the Committee, he referred to the Labour Party as a proprietorial party of the poor. Perhaps it is because he believes that property is associated with exploitation that he feels it necessary to exploit the poor by exaggerating the differences in income and welfare.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should clear up the point which was raised with me. As I understand it now, I was broadly correct. It is perfectly in order to move Amendments to increase contributions of employers and employees. The effect of so doing would be to vary also the Exchequer contribution, not directly, but to alter the basis on which the Exchequer contribution is made. It is not possible to move Amendments Which would alter the figures set out in the Money Resolution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point, we are grateful to you, Sir Stephen, for trying to help us. May I take it, from what you say, therefore, that it would not be in order to put down Amendments increasing the percentage contribution by the Exchequer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. That would be out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>244</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you. This is very relevant to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Southall (Mr. Bidwell); that would be one of our proposed Amendments if we were in order in making it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether I would be correct in congratulating the hon. Member for Kingston-upon-Thames (Mr. Norman Lamont) on his maiden speech in a Standing Committee. I think that is so, and I think that congratulations are in order. He has made a very spirited and valiant counter-attack on behalf of the rather silent benches opposite. I congratulate him on the excellence of his briefing and the bravura with which he delivered it. I do not intend to enter into the private statistical fight which he has with the hon. Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Meacher).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I felt, at one stage, that he was almost intolerably provoking him into making another counter-speech. If that debate could take place on purely personal terms between them, my money would still be on my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham. West. I know that the Committee is anxious to make some progress. Therefore, I shall not attempt to act as referee in that private fight which I hope will be resumed perhaps on another Amendment, or on some other occasion before too long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has inevitably been a rather lengthy debate. I say "inevitably", because we are discussing no fewer than 58 Amendments affecting the welfare of some 10 million or more people. I should make one point clear at this stage, and I should be grateful for the hon. Gentlemen's attention while I make it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because we do not wish frivolously to waste time on this important matter, we do not propose to vote on all 58 Amendments. The Committee, which has been suggesting that we have been making propaganda gestures of a reckless kind, should note that, instead of voting on the 58 Amendments, as we should be fully entitled, we shall be voting only on nine. We have taken the nine as the most representative of the range of the arguments which we have been trying to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must put on record that restraining ourselves manfully in this way does not mean that we are not interested in the rest of the minutiae of the benefits in the Schedule, that we are indifferent to the

level of the widowed mother's allowance, or the guardian's allowance, or the age addition, or the constant attendance allowance, or the widower's pension. As a sympathiser of women's lib, I should be the last to be indifferent to a widower's pension, because I believe passionately in sex equality. I make this point, because I very sincerely hope that the Government will not make political capital out of our desire not to abuse the time of the Committee by voting on every one of the possible Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, it is necessary for me to make this point, because the hon. Gentleman has not been very scrupulous in the attacks which he has made on my hon. Friends. Indeed, it is a tribute to the power of our arguments that we goaded the hon. Gentleman to his feet, almost spluttering with indignation, while a number of Members still wanted to speak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the course of his almost apoplectic reply, the Under-Secretary lectured my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda, West (Mr. Alec Jones)—a more reasonable and moderately worded man one could not hope to meet—about the cost of our proposals. When my hon. Friend tried to intervene to make a sensible suggestion, the hon. Gentleman shook his finger at him in a most menacing fashion, saying, "I have not finished with him yet". Then he went on to give his estimate of the cost of our proposals, in gross terms, and did not even attempt to give us the net ones until I pointed out to him that there was a slight difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West, the hon. Gentleman could scarcely contain himself over what he considered to be his intellectual dishonesty, using figures—he said—which with his understanding of the subject he should realise were wrong. He admonished him like a schoolmaster, saying, "I hope he is now ashamed". The hon. Gentleman was really rattled, and I hope he will be even more rattled when I have finished with him. I assure him that I do not intend to run away from any of his points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I could begin with a little bit of history. I have a special personal interest in this group of Amendments because, as a member of the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party, along
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>246</span>
with the T.U.C. and the co-operative movement and the National Council of Labour, I have been pressing and agitating for a substantial increase in pensions since the beginning of last winter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember one of the great debates at the last Labour Party conference demanding a substantial increase in pensions. The hon. Member for Kingston-upon-Thames (Mr. Norman Lamont) made what I thought was a rather cheap jibe at Mr. Jack Jones of the Transport and General Workers Union. This was not the best part of his speech; he slipped a little there. I remember that conference, with the leader of the Transport and General Workers Union pledging all the resources and efforts of his massive union behind the need to give a new priority to the pensioners, and for us, as a society, to take another leap forward towards not equality of treatment, but the barest shadow of social justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was a little intrigued When the hon. Member for Kingston-upon-Thames told us about the evils of a society with total equality of incomes. I could not see what that had to do with these Amendments, which would have the effect of increasing the single person's pension to £8. He accused my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West of trying to create a point of envy by talking about the concessions which have been made by this Government to the rich. If he thinks that pension or benefit of £8 per week will bring us anywhere nearer to the equal society of which he talks, he has no realisation of the size of income enjoyed by some people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's speech was a great revelation of the difference of approach between the two sides of the Committee on this issue. One is a long way from envying the rich when one is agitating for a subsistence level as of right of £8 a week. Therefore, I think it was a sign of the new responses in our society when last winter we started the campaign for increased pensions. It was certainly something new at our party conference to have the trade union movement throwing itself behind such a welfare claim so strongly and so efficiently. I think it was a reflection of the mood of our society when we organised that massive meeting in the Albert Hall. People came from all over the country. That was after the Government had just
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0695">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>247</span>
given what they said was the most generous increase since their last one, in 1955.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We in the Committee are reflecting the national mood. We are not speaking on a basis of class bitterness. If one wanted to be "class bitter", one would ask for a much greater pension than £8 a week. We are talking about something about which society is ashamed. I do not think all the logic-chopping over statistics is the substance of what we are talking about—though I shall do a little myself to keep in the swing. It was with a general sense of responsibility that we started the campaign in the National Council of Labour last winter. We said that we wanted a £1 increase right away and another increase in the Budget. If we could not have the £1 increase right away for legitimate administrative reasons, could we not put an emergency winter payment into operation, just as the Labour Government did when we took office in October, 1964, and found not a sheet of paper in preparation for a pensions increase, let alone administrative preparation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we wasted not time in getting our legislation for the uprating on the Statute Book, we said we would not make the poorest of the old wait; even though there is a balance of payments deficit of £800 million, we shall not use that as an excuse to make them wait. We put an emergency winter payment into operation. The pensioners have not had their winter payment, or an increase in the long-term addition—another device which the Labour Government, even at times of maximum economic difficulty, operated between upratings. Nor do we have the improved heating allowance, which all of us, in our heart of hearts, know we ought to have had last winter because of the increase in fuel prices and because of the evidence coming in from every side that pensioners last winter, as they will again have to do in the coming winter, had to go to bed in the afternoons to keep warm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In February we went on a deputation to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Social Services. I was a member of that deputation. Again we asked for a £2 increase in the Budget that was then being prepared.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We accept the hon. Gentleman's figure that if such an increase were made not
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>248</span>
only in pensions but across the board in all benefits the gross cost would be about £800 million and the net cost about £700 million. We suggested a way of paying for it. Members of the Committee might not all agree with our suggestion, but it was a perfectly legitimate way of paying for it. We suggested that 5 per cent. of the cost could come from increased contributions and 95 per cent. could be shared between the Exchequer and the employers' contributions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been inhibited in putting down Amendments with regard to paying for the cost of our proposals. That element of freedom is denied to us under the Money Resolution. It is a little odd for the hon. Gentleman to draw up a tight Money Resolution and then complain if we say that we are constricted by it. He might have had that in mind when he was drawing it up. As my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Scotland (Mr. Marsden) pointed out, there is absolutely no reason why an Exchequer contribution of 18 per cent. should be eternally sacrosanct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Marsden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When one speaks in Committee one sometimes wonders whether one is heard. I have on four occasions asked the Minister a pertinent question which he has not answered and to which the hon. Member for Kingston-upon-Thames (Mr. Norman Lamont) did not apply his mind in his rather slick, clever contribution. I shall ask it again. Why must pensions and allowances be primarily financed by National Insurance contributions? It is a simple question. My constituents are demanding that I ask it in the Committee, but nobody will answer it for me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. The Government do not answer his question because if they did they would be answering the very taunt they made against us. But I have put forward a perfectly peaceful way of financing the proposals—95 per cent. divided equally between the Exchequer contribution and the employers' contributions. After all, the increase in the Exchequer contribution as a result of these changes was only £68 million in the present year, not a great deal to be contributed out of State revenues towards meeting this urgent need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State paled a little when we suggested that the rest of it be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0696">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>249</span>
put on to the employers' contributions. He closed his eyes and said that he trembled to think what that would do to prices. That was a very odd remark coming from the present Government. They have never hitherto stopped to consider the effect on prices of a succession of their own measures. This has been a high prices Government—not by accident but by choice. High prices are the result of the deliberate introduction of import levies and the common agricultural policy. High rents are the result of the deliberate introduction of the Housing Financing Bill. High fares are the result of the deliberate reduction in transport subsidies. High prices for essentials are the result of the deliberate introduction of value added tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I told the Secretary of State, when he talked about prices, that I could give him some suggestions for bringing them down. The Government could begin by abandoning the common agricultural policy; they could begin by abandoning the import levies; they could begin by abandoning their dear food policy. He just smiled and shook his head. But if the Government are so anxious to emulate the Common Market, I would point out that in the Common Market the employers' share of contributions is much higher than it is here. Yet this is one piece of Europeanism the Government are not prepared to adopt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our demand in the Labour movement has been based on one simple premise. The standard of living which we now expect millions of our people to enjoy is intolerable. That is the premise and our argument, and it has not once been denied. The hon. Member for Kingston-upon-Thames said that the poor have a reasonable case. That is very broad-minded of him. He might appreciate the reasonableness of their case a little more if he tried to live on £8 or £10 a week. What astonishes me is that the old-age pensioners are so remarkably reasonable in the light of their circumstances. All the hon. Gentleman's juggling with figures cannot alter the fact that the standard which we expect millions of our people to live on is intolerable. Nor can he get away from the fact that that standard of living is going down with every month that passes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This was the case made by my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West, whose figures nearly reduced the Under-Secretary to apoplexy. He gave him a great lecture on selectivity. Let us look at some of the answers the Under-Secretary gave about my hon. Friend's figures. First, he said—and others echoed this—that we are wrong to compare the value of the pension next October with what it was in November, 1969. The hon. Gentleman said that the fairest comparison one can make was to compare the real value of the pension six months after upratings. That is his choice. On that basis, he said, we should compare the real value of the old age pensions six months after Labour's 1965 uprating, namely, £3.89, with the real value six months after the Tory uprating of 1971, namely, £4.11—a magnificent gain of 12p.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who is playing at selectivity now?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why not go further back, to the Tory 1963 uprating on which the Labour up-rating of 1965 was such an improvement? If we do that, we must recalculate the sum on the basis of 1963 prices, which I have had done for me. Here is the picture of the value of the old age pension six months after uprating, based on 1963 figures throughout: in 1963, £3.37; 1965, £3.68; 1967, £3.75; 1969, a very small drop, £3.73; 1971, £3.89. Of course, the value of that £3.89 is now below the figure and is still falling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman may boast of a slight improvement in relation to prices under this Government, but what he cannot boast about is the marked improvement we achieved during our period of office—from £3.37, the Tory uprating of 1963, to £3.75 in 1967. It was that which set the new tone, the new pace, the new political auctioneering, if one likes, to which the Government had to conform. What the picture shows is that this Government, which returned to power, not with the balance of payments crisis which we faced in 1964 but with a record balance of payments surplus, did not attempt the same leap forward which we achieved in 1965. Therefore, they are falling behind the challenge of the hour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the right hon. Lady can sustain the argument that there was a great leap forward in the period 1964 to 1970. If one takes the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>251</span>
average real improvement over the years of the previous Tory Government, from 1951 to 1964, one finds a real improvement of 4½ per cent. a year, whereas the real improvement from 1964 to 1970, under Labour Government, was only 2½ per cent. a year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Castle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This just proves my point about selectivity. I shall come to records of Tory Governments under another heading in a moment. The hon. Gentleman started at 1965. But, if one starts at 1963 one finds that there was a big leap forward during a period of acute economic stringency. This Government did not have to face that situation when they came to power. If the hon. Gentleman is boasting about what was done in the 1950s, why was it not done in the 1960s and the 1970s? We ask him to face that question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Take another selective use of statistics by the hon. Gentleman. He challenged my hon. Friend on the erosion of the value of pensions since the last uprating. He said there was always an erosion of value between upratings, but that the erosion was much less under the Tory Government than under the Labour Government. He carefully selected two sets of figures to prove his point. He took the seven months after September, 1971, the Tory uprating, and said that the fall in purchasing power had been 3.9 per cent., whereas in the seven months after Labour's November, 1969, uprating, the fall in purchasing power had been 4.6 per cent. I challenged him on having taken one of the best Tory upratings to compare with one of our poorer ones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reminded him that in 1965 the Labour Government had given an 18½ per cent. increase in pensions to offset an increase in prices of only 5.8 per cent., whereas in 1971 the Tory Government had given an increase of 20 per cent. in the pension to offset an increase in prices of 16.5 per cent. So I told the hon. Gentleman that he was not comparing like with like. He was comparing the peak with the trough. He brushed my comment aside. He said
	<br><blockquote><p>"One would get exactly the same picture if one started from the 1965 uprating."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee D</i>, 22nd June, 1972; 	<i>c</i>. 207.]</p></blockquote>
But would one? I have been checking with sources just as reputable as any the Civil Service can mobilise for the hon. Gentleman. The fall in purchasing power
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>252</span>
in the first seven months after the 1965 uprating was not 3.9 per cent. or 4.6 per cent. but 2.8 per cent. So the hon. Gentleman lied to the Committee, and I hope he is now ashamed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quote these figures only to show that the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends are in no position to complain of selectivity. But the figures have an important lesson for us as well. They underline the major point that we have been trying to make in the debate, the point put by the hon. Gentleman in his reply when he said we ought to be dealing with adequacy. He said that what we were most concerned with was whether the benefits proposed were adequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us define our terms. Adequate for what? We say that the test should be whether they are adequate from the point of view of the moral tone of our society. Labour Governments, despite all the criticism that they did not do as much as they wanted, have been triumphantly superior despite the difficulties they always inherit. One of the political crosses which we have to bear is that the Labour Party is always elected to power to clear up the mess. We are supposed to build the new Jerusalem out of the mess hon. Gentlemen opposite have created.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does anybody deny that in 1945 the country was bankrupt? Winston Churchill himself said during the war that Britain was bankrupt and that the returning soldier would have nothing to come home to. But the 1945 Labour Government, despite the black economic outlook with which the country was faced, made it a priority to carry through the Beveridge Report—the National Insurance legislation that was put before the House. The hon. Member for Kingston-upon-Thames (Mr. Norman Lamont) spoke of the constructive Amendments his side always proposes. I remember as a back-bencher serving on the Standing Committee of the National Insurance Bill in 1947-48. I moved 67 Amendments to that Bill. It was from the Government's back-benchers that the pressure was coming for us to do more, not from hon. Gentlemen opposite.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same situation arose in 1965. I was a member of the Government that had to draw up that first Queen's Speech after the war, knowing the size of the balance of payments deficit, knowing that there was no money in the kitty and that the financial position was critical. Yet we made an immediate large increase in the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0698">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>253</span>
old age pension our overriding priority. The hon. Gentleman talked about paying for improvements. We did not hesitate to fix the social priority first and then find a way to pay for it. We did not hesitate to put 6d. on income tax. In case that very thought reduces the hon. Member for Kingston-upon-Thames to a tremor of political fear, let me remind him that it did not prevent us from winning the election of 1966, as I believe our people want us to build a more moral society. The reason for our difficulties today is that the present Government have reversed our priorities from the word "go" with a blatant appeal to the strong and the rich to maximise their self-interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real test is how the old-age pensioners are enabled to hold their own in the struggle. The hon. Gentleman should turn up one of Her Majesty's Stationery Office's publications, "Social Trends" and look at the table on the relationship between supplementary benefit rates, retail prices and average earnings from 1948 to the latest available date. He will find that during the period of Conservative office Tory rises did not do more than raise the pension back to its relationship with average national earnings for more than a part of the period. Labour's large increase, however, in 1965, put the pension clearly ahead of the rise in average national earnings, with a sufficient margin to keep it ahead throughout each review period, and only in the second half of 1970 did pensions begin to lose out again to earnings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Poverty is relative. We stand by the test that Labour has always given a higher relative value to old-age pensioners in our society. Justice is relative, too. If the price of adequate old-age pensions is to forgo tax reductions, we say that most people in this country would be willing to forgo them, provided that their sacrifice did not mean that someone richer than them would pocket all the tax reliefs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is in this context that we must talk about paying for a reasonable, decent pension for those on pensions and benefits—in the context of Tory budgetary policy over the last two years in which they have given away £300 million, a quarter of it to those with incomes of over £5,000 a year. That is an immoral priority. It is this context of injustice that has given us the runaway inflation that we have today—that and the deliberate Government
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>254</span>
policies on prices and on charges, as my hon. Friend has so effectively pointed out. The hon. Gentleman likes to taunt us with being the party of high taxation. That can be fairer and better than being the party of high prices and high charges, as the Government are. Now the Government are madly trying to reverse their policy. We are told that they will even do something about the property speculators. While they are having these second and better thoughts they had better do something about the old age pensioners, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must do this because not only are the pensioners in relative poverty, but with every month that passes they are in increasing absolute poverty. Will the hon. Gentleman tell the Committee by how much he expects prices to have risen by October, 1973? Various estimates have been given to the Committee: the National Institute's estimates, the food manufacturers' estimates; we could give those two. The food manufacturers have told the Government that entering the EEC will push up food prices higher than the Government have been willing to admit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now we have the new element, which some of us have always said would be part of the price we would have to pay for entering Europe: the floating of the £; the devaluation of the £, disguised by the word "floating". Is there a newspaper that does not now expect that this will give another upward twist to the price spiral? Will the hon. Gentleman tell us that the increase of 50p, in real terms, which the old-age pensioners will have this October is sufficient to cushion them against that devaluation and the coming cost of entering EEC?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Time and again the Government have solemnly pledged that they will insulate those on fixed incomes against the effects of entry. The October uprating is our last chance for another 12 months. A great part of our case is that we are now in an exceptional situation of a kind not faced previously, and we say that the insulation, compensation and protection that the Government are giving to the pensioners and others in that exceptional situation are grotesquely inadequate, and the Government know it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So, from the point of view of relative or absolute poverty, our duty is clear—to do more. I suggest to the Government—
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0699">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>255</span>
they are learning this lesson very slowly—that if they had the courage to do more, and then to tell the people that we must all get together and pay for this justice, they might begin to find that that was a less inflationary policy than encouraging every one of us to go for our own sectional short-term self-interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>I think that the Under-Secretary, my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle) and all who have put their minds on the problem of the old-age pension situation as it is related to national insurance entitlements, would accept that there is a novel feature about Amendment No. 20, whatever else may be thought about it. Those who are particularly discerning will see that it is, in fact, the Schedule of the Ten Minute Rule Bill that I put before the House last month.</p>
	<p>I think that there will be a kind of inevitability about crossing the line with the previous discussion but I shall try hard not to be too repetitive in my argument as it relates to raising money and giving the old people a better deal than they are receiving at present.</p>

	<p>I assume that there is sincerity in what the hon. Member for Kingston-upon-Thames (Mr. Norman Lamont) has had to say, for example, and what the hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Boscawen) has said. The hon. Member for Kingston-upon-Thames stated that the poor—as he condescendingly described them—have a case. The hon. Member for Wells, in one of his earlier contributions, said that he personally favoured the proposal that the national state retirement pension in real terms should be upgraded. After spending most of his time in decrying and to some

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>259</span>
extent disowning the argument of my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Meacher), he finally came round to revealing his mind to the Committee that he himself was in favour of this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a certain simplicity about it, although it will be necessary to some extent to deploy arguments about its urgency, its justification and why it need not necessarily have to wait for an incoming Labour Government in order to carry it through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I confess that I am no statistician; mathematics was not my strongest point when I left the elementary school at 14 years of age. However, I learnt to put a few words together after that period, mainly through the trade union movement, and my interest in the whole field of national insurance and more especially the plight of old people in our society stems greatly from that experience which I had.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may be allowed a small digression in relating my thoughts to the earlier intervention in the other debate of my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Scotland (Mr. Marsden), the reason why the Opposition still cling to the concept of national insurance as being related to the entitlements of old people as a benefit is that that is the position of the Trades Union Congress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the old days of the Independent Labour Party, and of fiercer theoretical Socialist discussion, it was a powerfully held view that it would be better not to think in terms of national insurance entitlements, but that the moneys required should be raised by Exchequer means, in order to give the old people a better deal—In other words, to upgrade substantially the national pension as it affects our old people—women over 60 and men over 65—simply by means of such a device.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I imagine that the intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Scotland (Mr. Marsden) indicates that he is thinking in terms of old-fashioned Socialism. The fact that it is old-fashioned does not discredit it at all. The Opposition still lean heavily toward the concept of ever heavier national exchequer contributions, while the Government's forecasts indicate an ever decreasing national exchequer contribution in proportion. That is the real position, and it is that which makes the great divide. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle) indicated during her
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>260</span>
rejoinder in the last debate, that is the substance of the argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to centre the thoughts of the Committee entirely upon the actual proposals of the Amendment, because it amounts to looking at figures. When statistics are mentioned I am reminded—in particular, when I listened to the exchanges between my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Meacher) and the hon. Member for Kingston-upon-Thames (Mr. Lamont)—of a little book which used to be circulated called "How to Lie with Statistics". Then I thought of the old joke about the woman wearing the bikini, and the whole concept of the usage of statistics. Statistics, like the bikini, reveal much that it interesting but, also like the bikini, they conceal much that is vital—which is the nub of the argument between us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Considering the terms of my Amendment, it is necessary to explain to the Committee what this means figurewise. First, there is the apparent oddity of dropping percentages. Set out in the Amendment are the dates when these percentages are proposed to apply. The first group of figures relates to the woman's entitlement by virtue of her husband's insurance, and the fact that he is alive—in other words, a woman dependant's entitlement by virtue of her husband's insured contributory situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary may be interested to hear how this occurred. In seeking to relate it to the argument presented in my Ten-Minute Rule Bill speech, the House of Commons staff who assisted me in bringing out the Schedule found that this was a set of figures which they would have to use in order to push the idea of the single pension—in this case, the male pension—to the concept of one-third, away from the one-fifth around which it has hovered through the years. This has been alluded to during a fairly lengthy debate. It is in working in three stages toward the concept of pushing up the couples' national insurance entitlement—that is, up to half the national average earnings—that this set of figures was arrived at. Even so, although it indicates, in the formula, a drop in percentages in the case of the dependent woman, the dependent woman could not get any bene-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0702">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>261</span>
fits other than by virtue of her husband's insured position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not putting this forward as the last word—there may be a better way to do it—but the principle is positively stated that to get a reality one would have to take the percentage that applied to the dependent wife and add it to the lower percentage as it applied to the insured male pensioner. Those two figures would then add up to a progressive move, year by year, committed, at least in three yearly increments, to a rising standard in real terms in relation to national average earnings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think the Committee should put its mind to the technical details of national average earnings. Thus, we see that a woman's 19 per cent. of average earnings would have to be related to the husband's 26 per cent. of average earnings. We must bear in mind that it moves up and down. I have been looking at the figures again during the course of the Committee, and I find that when one takes the single pension in relation to the national average earnings it is sometimes a minus, and sometimes it is a plus. As we have already found, dependent upon where one takes the figures, one can make comparisons which sometimes lead one up the garden. I would not say that it is an element of trickery, but that it comes inevitably from the work of all statistical activity, which does not always tell the full story.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last night I met some old people, who have a great deal of expertise on the question, and they told me that the claim that the national single person's pension has had a relationship of 20 per cent. of national average earnings is not correct, because the national average earnings figure is struck in October of each year. The old-age pension increase is often announced in the April Budget, and it is thought of in terms of the existing figure. Currently, the figure given is £30.93. The present £6, which is to go up under the Government's proposals to £6.75 in October, is less than 20 per cent. the figure declared and known from last October, but the current figure must be considerably greater than that given, and that in October of this year will be greater still. If we multiply the rate of £6.75 by 5, we have £33.75 as the average earned income to agree with the new pension rate being one-fifth of the national average earned
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>262</span>
income. It may well reach this figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are in a dodgy economic situation. The Opposition have so far shown considerable restraint in attacking the Government's economic policy. Part of this consideration is that we have a national ship to steer, and that we must have an element of responsible opposition, as it affects us internally. This is very much in the minds of leading Members of the Opposition, and I think my right hon. Friend would agree with this. However, the effects must necessarily lead to rising import prices and, therefore, rising food prices, since we grow less than half the food we can consume in this country. The Under-Secretary will need to say something about this. It must necessarily bear heavily upon the living costs of old people in particular.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will inevitably be pressures. Whether the outcome of discussions with the CBI and the TUC, the getting away from the Industrial Relations Act and the getting away from that kind of thought results in a more equitable climate, as it were, a lowering of the collision that the Government seem to be set upon, remains very much to be seen. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle) indicated, a substantial improvement in old-age pensions, or the adoption of my Amendment this morning, would go a long way towards convincing trade union leaders in particular that, in effect, by operating some kind of restraint, they were actually aiding their kind of people. This must be successfully shown. I doubt that the Conservative Government and the present Prime Minister are big enough or wise enough to seize the opportunities that would be presented to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The technical details again are that the proposal is to raise the pension in real terms by these three stages. The first figures mentioned are those in the initial proposals of the Amendments put down in the other debate by my right hon. Friend and hon. Members on this side of the Committee for an upgrading of the pension to £8 single and £14 double, and then moving it progressively in these three stages until one arrives at the half-pay pension. This is not reaching for the moon. It is an extremely modest demand, having regard to the fact that we have annually a national increase in the gross national product.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Under-Secretary has
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0703">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>263</span>
tended to say, "Well, we have marginally done better than you", a Tweedledee-Tweedledum situation has arisen. Apart from that spirit that my right hon. Friend paid attention to, of increasing the single and the double pensions in relation to national average earnings in 1965, we have not had much to write home about on this side of the Committee. That has been freely admitted. Certainly there is nothing to write home about on the other side of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I made my speech on Second Reading of the Bill in the House, I gained the ear of the Secretary of State himself because he had not heard my Ten-Minute Rule Bill speech. He listened attentively to what I said. He is on record in the magazine "Age Concern Today", which reached us a couple of days ago, as saying, in welcoming the publication:
	<br><blockquote><p>"One of my main concerns as Secretary of State for Social Services has been to get a better deal for the elderly on all the fronts on which my Department operates …"</p></blockquote>
There have been changes not opposed by the Opposition. We do not think they are a lot to write home about, but we have not opposed them. The over eighties Bill, for example, to which I shall refer again in a moment or two, is an indication of this, but it is not real terms improvement so far as the aged as a whole are concerned. Here is an opportunity for the Secretary of State. Here is a proposal upon which he can fasten his mind. No argument presented by the other side of the Committee has suggested that they oppose the principle of seriously upgrading the national state retirement pension every year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question might arise, and would arise in the minds of those at the Young Socialist Conference, who want nothing less than a national retirement pension of about £30 a week. I think that that was the declaration made by the National Federation of Old Age Pensioners, who felt constrained at their most recent national conference to raise their demands above the £8 for a single person and £14 for a couple that is the baseline of the proposals in the Amendment and is the immediate demand of the Opposition as set out in the previous Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Council of Labour, which is the body which brings together the co-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>264</span>
operative movement, the TUC and the Labour Party, has demanded an immediate £8 for the single person and £14 for the couple. But I want to go further. So far as I know, it has never yet been done. My right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn said, in her contribution to the National Insurance debate—which I was not able to hear, because, as I explained, I was at the Select Committee on Race Relations, which takes a great deal of my time—that she accepted the principle of the commitment to move annually along that path. As far as I know, the Secretary of State does not disown that commitment—or, if he does not like the word "commitment", at any rate the aim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, the argument of the Under-Secretary so far has been precisely to show that he is doing that—not that he is in favour of it in principle, but he is telling us that, in practical terms, his old-age pension is worth more than Labour's old-age pension. We do not believe him; least of all do the old-age pensioners. I am sure that he meets representatives from old-age pensioners' groups and representatives of all kinds of pressure groups; I know his right hon. Friend the Under-Secretary does so. I am sure that they remain entirely unmoved and unconvinced that the pension of October of £6.75, and £10.90 for a couple, is not a better deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this is how to lead people up the garden with statistics, the recipients least of all can be led up the garden. We have said earlier—there is inevitably an overlap in the argument—that it is freely acknowledged that £6.75 in October is not good enough, and that no one can live on it. It is freely acknowledged that, if that is the only income of an insured person over 60 or 65, that person cannot live on that sum. Such a person has the facility, if he likes to take it, of going for national supplementary benefit which, on an average, as far as it affects old people who draw the supplementary benefit, is over £2 a week. It is £2.27, I think, currently. Again, that can rather lead people up the garden. It does not mean that everyone who applies for supplementary benefit gets that sum of money. One can play around a good deal with averages. The extreme example of striking averages is the railway porter who gets £20 a week and Mr. Marsh's salary. One cuts it in two and has the average rate of pay for the railway-men. It follows that many recipients of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0704">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>265</span>
supplementary benefit get considerably less than £2, whilst others get a sum not considerably greater but a little greater than the £2.27.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one nows, least of all the Under-Secretary, how many who really need additional income do not apply for it. We have said a great deal about the reasons for this. It is sometimes due to ignorance, sometimes to tremendous pride. Great pride in not being thought scroungers exists among older people more than in any other section of our community. I said in my Second Reading speech that they just rub along. The supplementary benefit averages reveal a good deal if one looks into them deeply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary argued about the 1966 survey. His department is long overdue for a survey on this question if that is the case. That was the year I became a Member of Parliament, and the situation could have changed dramatically in that period. The Under-Secretary challenged the remarks of my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle) when she declared that there was a considerable number—far greater than that in the mind of the Under-Secretary—of people, old people in particular, living below the subsistence line who do not apply. If one upgrades the national retirement pension, one takes care of a great deal of that. I think the question that might be in the minds of Conservative Members—is that one might be giving a few pounds to people who do not need it, people who are not on their uppers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My estimate—although I am not a statistician; I have to turn to my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Meacher) for confirmation—is that at present half the aged population are in need. This is not on the basis of the Social Security Department figures. If one is old and gets £6.75 in October, one may perhaps have £2 from a small pension scheme—that is how it applies to the majority of old people in this country who has never had a chance to contribute to decent pension schemes. If one is in that position and one has £200 in the bank, one should spend it instead of leaving it for the children to squabble about. The old people should spend their money on having a good holiday in the sunshine, but they are scared to do it. They are between the devil and the deep blue sea. They are not absolutely penniless. This
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>266</span>
would apply to the mainstream of old people in this country who have worked hard and are full of pride and a great deal of prejudice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hear about this prejudice. I represent a constituency with an enormous Indian community. I have more immigrants in my constituency than any other hon. Member. I am not saying that we have more in the London Borough of Ealing or that there are more immigrants in certain London areas than in other cities. But I have a 20,000 strong Indian community in my constituency. Now and again indigenous old people go to the post office to draw their £6.75 or £10.90 as it will be in October and they see immigrants putting money in their Post Office savings accounts. Figures show that immigrants in this country send a considerable amount of money home to their poorer relatives in their countries of origin. That is very good for the exchange situation and for the economy in the countries from which they come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But old people who do not think sufficiently are sometimes jealous of this. I have to lecture them and tell them that their better deal in the future, which I hope we can get—though I do not think we will get it under a Conservative Government—will depend upon the energy exertion, skills and education of so many of these people. The future of many of the old indigenous people rests upon the energy, skill and full employment of immigrants. The more intelligent of my constituents have accepted that as a fact of life. On the other hand, the immigrant community, who are mostly wage earners with very few old people in relation to their total numbers, are, by and large, an asset to the economy of this country. We have stated this time and again in order to rebut racialist prejudice in this country.

These are the feelings that exercised my mind when I presented a Ten Minute Rule Bill one afternoon in the anti-climax after the Prime Minister had answered Questions—though I do not know whether it can be called a climax these days. I presented it because, in my view, this is one of the most urgent social problems of our time. I set forth the figures and I unashamedly put forward my proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary may have been a bit puzzled by the figures initially, but if he adds them together in the two sections it will all become clear. If he says that he

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>267</span>
accepts the principles behind my proposals and that something like this will be done by the Government in the next three years, then I might be constrained to suggest to my hon. and right hon. Friends that we should not press the Amendment to a Division. The reason that it is not presented as an official Opposition proposal is that my right hon. Friend cannot be committed to the exact figures. But she has already stated that she is committed to the principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question to which the Under-Secretary must reply, therefore, is whether the Government are committed to the principle. The Under-Secretary's remarks during previous sittings suggest that he is not only committed to these principles in practical terms, but he is also committed to the humanitarian principles. I recall reading his speech in reply to the arguments of the Opposition on the question of the "over-eighties" pension—the concept of giving a National Insurance pension right to people who had not contributed to it. This was first put forward when the Conservative Party was in opposition. We did not oppose it. We are not opposed to giving such people a bit extra. But we are afraid of a couple of pounds falling into pockets that are not empty, which is exactly what the "over-eighties" legislation did. The Under-Secretary said that humanity got the better of him, and rightly so. One hopes that out of all this statistical morass in the Committee stage of this Bill humanity will get the better of the Under-Secretary and he will commit himself along the lines I have suggested. The great argument—and the Opposition did not divide the House on the matter—was that the people who would benefit had had no opportunity to contribute in their time.

That is exactly the argument behind upgrading the national State retirement pension, as the bulk of such people who would gain—not substantially, of course, as it is a modest proposal—are the very people who have not had the opportunity of contributing to decent pension schemes. They have partly been affected by the fact that there were no transferability rights. In the Government's present proposals, "Strategy for Pensions", transferability rights of pensioners are now accepted. That is a very progressive move. I can
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>268</span>
only assume that the progressive Tories have overcome the unprogressive Tories. The hon. Member for Kensington, South (Sir B. Rhys Williams) made his maiden speech on this question, and I remember warmly congratulating him on it. One finds now that this principle is enshrined in the Government's thinking about the future of occupational pension schemes. In the past that has been an impediment, as it applies to the aged part of the population. Many of them would have been in jobs where they changed their employers frequently. I had in mind the building trade. It was not until the Acts of nationalisation after the Second World War that these pension schemes came into being under nationalised industries. For example, some railway employers were more progressive than others. They had a gratuity pension payment arrangement, a non-contributory arrangement, or a contributory arrangement. Then there was standardisation of pension arrangements after the nationalisation of the railway industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This, however, never amounted to much. In the building trade and in factories, the workers would be in small schemes for short periods, then change their employers and cash in, getting back their own contributions in a lump sum, plus a rate of interest. They would not therefore have built up any continuity of entitlement or even a frozen arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accepted on Second Reading that the future looks brighter for the coming generation of workers, whether there is a Labour Government operating their national superannuation ideas, or a Conservative Government operating transferability and the build-up of occupational pension schemes as negotiated between the trades unions and the employers. Even if one has that broad highway to look forward to, we must still return to the plight of the present old-age pensioners, who do not have such a broad highway opening up before them.</p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bidwell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to do exactly as you say, Sir Stephen. I understand the reasons for your anxiety to get our eyes on the ball, on the specific proposals that are before the Committee. I can only return to my argument that the Minister really wants to do it. I do not know why he is so coy. I hope that in a moment he will tell us that he wants to do it and how, therefore, he proposes to do so if he is not going to accept my Amendment this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have thought since that no references have been made to the way in which national average earnings are drawn up. It is directly applicable to my proposals, and the Committee must have it firmly in mind. I am sure the Under-Secretary and my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (O'Malley), who was a Minister himself, will agree that it is not easy to find any measuring rod which can be considered an accurate instrument. I understand that we have an old people's index, but it seems to have fallen into disuse. That is why the TUC and the pensioners' associations, and many people in the wider area of age concern, have raised the question of relating the basic State retirement pension to national average earnings. What are national average earnings? I think the Committee should know. It is not by any means a perfect yardstick. It is not national average income. If one were relating old-age pensions to national average income, and thinking of half-pay entitlements, pensions would have to go up considerably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
National average earnings, however, relate to male manual workers' average weekly earnings. It is not even a graph of salaried workers, who can be very rich or very poor. But the national average wage for male workers is accepted by economists and statisticians as the best measuring rod available. It is more likely to explain how the chap next door lives, whether he lives on a council housing estate, or in a modest semi-detached owner-occupied estate, which occupies a great part of my constituency and next door in Hayes. Most of these people vote Labour, although they are owner-occupiers or they are living on the "never-never" system and are in the hands of the moneylenders. They are the people on the Clapham omnibus. It is not a perfect measuring instrument but it is the closest that we can get to the ordinary man.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are national average earnings, there-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>270</span>
fore, as a statistic, correct? All workers do not, in fact, get £30 per week; many get £20 a week or less. The Under-Secretary of State does not disown that we should relate the national State retirement pension to a percentage of national average earnings. This is the TUC's proposal. There has been much discussion on how this should be paid for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raised with you, Sir Stephen, the question whether we should be in order in making specific national exchequer proposals, and you explained that we could not really do that but, insofar as we made proposals to raise employers' or employees' contributions, then 	<i>ipso facto</i> the national exchequer amount, although looking like a blank, would become obvious in real terms. That, in effect, was your ruling; it inhibited us from doing what the hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Boscawen) chided us about, and the Under-Secretary took up the cry, that we had not applied ourselves practically to these questions because we had not put forward Amendments to Schedule 2 to show practically how the money was to be found.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am entirely unashamed. My proposal is a practical set of ideas on how the Government could move forward in this respect, and clearly I am prevented from putting forward positive and concrete proposals on Schedule 1 as to how I think that the measures should be paid for and the cash raised in order to meet these novel demands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is an idea that when the Opposition side of the Committee retires into privacy we might think this out again. Then we could have on the Order Paper a number of Amendments which meet this point. They might not make for progress in the Committee but they would at least show that we know how the money should be raised. I suspect, however, Sir Stephen, that, like myself, you think that the Government's case has been effectively answered in this respect. The question is whether people seriously want to pay for it. Do they want to move away from the present ratio of the national State retirement pension? I think the answer is a resounding "yes" and among the contributions which we have had from the Government side of the Committee we have not had a serious one which has suggested that the people as a whole do not want this to take place.

The contributions from the hon. Members for Wells, and for Kingston-upon-Thames (Mr. Lamont), while they would not allow us to get away with any statistical arguments, did not decry the principle. Therefore, I ask the Under-Secretary to tell us what is standing in the way of the acceptance, if not of the detail of my Amendment, at least of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>272</span>
principle of upgrading the retirement pension in real terms in progressive stages over the next three years.
