	<p>(	<i>Morning</i>)</p>
	<p>[Sir STEPHEN MCADDEN in the Chair]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>LOCAL GOVERNMENT BILL</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That during the further proceedings on the Local Government Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock.—[	<i>Mr. Graham Page.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denis Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are supporting this Motion with reservations. It is almost unique in our experience that a Committee of this House, by agreement or at the urge of a Government, should meet for two whole days twice a week, and should propose to do this continuously for the remaining stages of the Bill. It shows a lack of wisdom on the part of the Government in packing so much vital matter into one Bill when, clearly, what we have before us are at least four Bills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We agree with the Government that we want the fullest possible discussion of the vital matters covered in this Bill. May I remind the Committee of what we have to decide concerning the future of local government, not just for the next five years but for the next 50 years or, indeed, 100 years. We are being asked to decide the whole future of the educational service, where it should be put and in what sort of authority it should be put. This is a matter of violent controversy throughout the country. We are being asked to decide what are the best arrangements for land and housing and for the availability of services for industry for the whole of the country. We are asked to decide the whole question of planning, both regionally and locally, structure plans and detail plans, and that, again, is a matter of the gravest concern to planners, whichever view one takes as to which set of planners might be right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are asked to discuss the whole question of the social services and the welfare services. We are asked to do all that in this Bill, and some of us are find-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>718</span>
ing it almost physically impossible to prepare ourselves from one day to the next for the arguments that come forward. I am sure the Minister will have sympathy with us when he understands that we do not have an army of civil servants—[	<i>Interruption</i>].</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Stephen—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have just asked for the noise outside the room to be stopped.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Sir Stephen: you have read my thoughts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I took it that an outside workman was applauding the sentiments that I am expressing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure the Minister will be sympathetic to the point that, unlike the Government, who have an army of civil servants from all these Ministries to support them, to provide arguments and to think ahead not only from day to day but from week to week, the Opposition has no such luxury. It has to do its own spade work and its own homework, which is evidence of the Opposition's desire to co-operate as fully as it can in the proper study of this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Cocks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whilst I do not oppose this Sittings Motion, I should point out to the Minister that the extra Sitting will impinge upon meetings of the Parliamentary Labour Party on Thursday evenings, and I hope he will be considerate in the way in which he arranges the business at this time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sir Stephen, may I ask for your guidance on the specific point concerning this afternoon? You will appreciate that we have come to this meeting today expecting that the next meeting would be on Tuesday of next week, Would it be in order if we were to submit manuscript Amendments concerning business which might well be dealt with this afternoon, and could they be considered for selection?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It all depends on the nature of the manuscript Amendments, but I must point out that the Minister gave notice at the last Sitting that he was going to move that we should sit this afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would it be possible for you. Sir Stephen, to explore
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0395">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>719</span>
the possibility of our being informed of impending Divisions in the Chamber of the House? As we are now going to be sitting four times a week, there are many of us who would, on occasions, like to be in the Chamber, and if we could be informed of Divisions here, it would be useful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid I can only inform hon. Members when Divisions are taking place in the normal way when the bells ring. I cannot inform hon. Members of impending Divisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Sir Stephen; I mean Divisions in this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I could foretell when Divisions are going to take place in this Committee, I would be a very clever chap.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Blenkinsop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think this question was raised earlier when we discussed the Sittings Motion concerning Tuesday afternoons. It was understood that inquiries would be made to see whether there was any way in which those of us who find it necessary from time to time to be on the Floor of the Chamber could be informed of the conduct of business here in this Committee. We are kept informed of what is happening in the Chamber while we are here; it is of equal importance to us that we should have some means of knowing what is the progress of work here in the Committee while we are in the Chamber.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernest Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. There have been occasions when the time for a Division has been extended to give those hon. Members who are in the Chamber time to come to a Committee, and also it has been signified there that a Division was taking place in a particular Committee. I wonder whether that arrangement could be looked at.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly consult the usual channels to make sure that adequate time is given for Divisions up here. I may say that this question of notifying when Divisions are taking place upstairs through the use of the television was raised at an earlier meeting of this Committee and has been raised with the Services Committee. They have decided
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>720</span>
that the use of the television screen for announcing what is going on in the Chamber, plus its use for announcing what is going on in the Finance Committee, when it is sitting, plus its use for notification of Divisions in the House of Lords is sufficient, and they are not prepared to extend its use further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas Swain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. Is it not a fact that when a Division is called in Committee the Chairman can use his own discretion as to when he cries, "Lock the doors"? If we are away on business in the Chamber, that would give us enough time to get here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I tried to make that clear. It is certainly within my discretion as to how long the interval is before I say, "Lock the doors". I have in the past—as I shall in the future—consulted with the usual channels before giving the command, "Lock the doors".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope you will use your undoubted influence to see that the House of Lords do not have preference over this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid I am not a member of the Services Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a long time since an Opposition was as co-operative on a highly controversial Measure as we are in giving the Government this proposed change in our Sittings without a very long debate. Right hon. and hon. Members on both sides will know that outside this House there is the most intense interest among local government circles in our procedure, and I hope that the Government will appreciate that it is because of our firm intention that full and adequate discussion shall be allowed on these issues that will affect the structure of local government for a generation that we are being so forthcoming this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In particular, may I say that I hope it is an indication that when we eventually reach the Welsh Clauses of this Measure there will be the same ample discussion provided as we are pleased to provide for those who represent English constituencies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Development (Mr. Graham Page)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope we can make some arrangements about informing hon. Members of Divi-

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>721</span>
sions in the Committee, when they are outside the room, because I realise that many people are disappointed if they miss the winding-up speeches in debates, particularly tonight, and I am sorry that we have had to move this Motion on this very day. I hope that we can press the Services Committee to look at it again. I am not on the Committee and I do not know what its deliberations were but I am sure that, if it has been done on one Bill, we might press it to see if it can accommodate us on this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Birmingham. Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) said, the support which we are receiving from the Opposition in the procedure on the Bill is unique. It is a unique Committee and a unique Bill. It is the first time since Disraeli that Parliament has been asked to look at local government reform on this scale and I am very grateful to the Opposition for rising to the occasion and giving us the support which they are giving on the timetable for the Bill. I hope that we can make these four sessions convenient to all those who want to take part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should say that the Services Committee has considered this matter and has come to the decision which I have announced. I shall certainly make further representations to it, but in the interest of Members of the Committee, I would suggest that the usual channels ought to try to make their own arrangements to see that their Members are notified; I shall certainly co-operate as far as possible in arranging a reasonable interval to allow people to return from the House to the Committee room.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This does not greatly help us about the trouble tonight. I am sorry that I was not here when this matter was raised at the beginning. I am certain that, as the right hon. Gentleman just mentioned, the Opposition have been very co-operative on the Committee. Therefore I speak in an entirely nonpartisan way. Tonight is an exception, at least for some Members of the Committee if not for every Member of the entire House. Some Members very much want to hear what is going on and their loyalties will be hard pressed indeed if they have to be in the Committee rather than attending the debate in the House this afternoon and this evening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>722</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have great confidence in the ingenuity of the usual channels to make a satisfactory arrangement to alert their colleagues in the House when they are required up here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That during the further proceedings on the Local Government Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock.</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denis Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As you kindly pointed out to the Committee already, Sir Stephen, in discussing Amendment No. 386 we are also discussing many other Amendments, particularly Amendments Nos. 229 and 238. What we are discussing, in fact, is the whole future of local government arrangement for the West Midland conurbation and in particular for the City of Birmingham and its neighbours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what I wish to address myself to in the main burden of my opening remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have the rare privilege today to speak for the whole of Birmingham, because this is one of the few occasions when the whole of Birmingham politically is absolutely agreed about the disastrous nature of the Government's proposals and is determined in its opposition to them. The city is united in expressing its fears that the proposals which the Committee now has before it will deal a great blow to its future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Birmingham, like other great cities, has not achieved its status by accident. It
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>724</span>
achieved it in the past, under the leadership in the city of different political parties, because over the years it has combined the three essential requirements of any great city. The first of these can be stated as the major economic strength to sustain a large population and that, of course, means industry. The second requirement is the ability to house and to succour its people, which means good local government. The third requirement has been the foresight to meet a changing situation from generation to generation and from year to year and an ability to solve its own problems, and that means achieving an understanding between central and local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So Birmingham has prospered until now, but it cannot be emphasised too strongly that, if this Government, or any other, undermine the relationships, the city will be put into peril. When that happens, the industrial strength of Birmingham and of the country will certainly be in jeopardy. It is extremely unfortunate that this debate takes place at a moment when Birmingham already has grave fears for its future. The unemployment figures are disastrous. Yet the central Government have been very slow to respond to this situation, to sense that change in the industrial position, to respond to the need to bring in new industry and to expand the existing potential of Birmingham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On top of this disastrous unemployment situation and the changing economic forces in Birmingham, the ability of the city council to solve its own problems and to govern itself will be removed by the Bill. Birmingham will cease to be an all-purpose authority. It will be left with all the pressures of a large urban population and with no land with which to ease those pressures or to meet that situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Government seem to have a mania for destroying things that are working well. They are taking the great gamble that, in the case of our large cities, and particularly in the case of Birmingham, their proposals will work at least as well as the existing local government structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An important criterion is that, unless the Government can show that the new pattern of local government which they are proposing for Birmingham can be guaranteed to work at least as well as the existing situation, they have no business proposing any such change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having now spent several months
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0398">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>725</span>
talking not only to the civic leaders but to the industrial leaders, university people and people of no political persuasion, I can find no-one, whose judgment I respect, who believes that the Government can put their hands on their hearts and say that the proposals for Birmingham will be at least as good for the future government of Birmingham as the existing situation which we are trying to terminate. The opposite is the case. The one authoritative investigation into the government of Birmingham and the future government of Birmingham was the Redclilfe-Maud Committee, who, as we know, plumped for the city region concept which we cannot discuss again today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Government threw overboard the proposals of the Redclilfe-Maud Committee, they struck a serious blow at the viability of the city of Birmingham and not just from the point of view of local government. I cannot emphasise this too strongly, because a good city is a mixture of its industry, its local government, its relation with central government and its dealings with people, and all this is now put at risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On top of the changing and deteriorating economic situation in the city, we now have the Government proposals for the reorganisation of the water industry. It is the belief of everybody in Birmingham that this reaffirms all our worst fears of what will happen about the services and the organisation of the local government. The organisation of the City of Birmingham's water supply is a story of excellence, and I think that is a statement which challenges contradiction. I know no one who would say other than that we have supplied the finest quality of water, with the co-operation of our Welsh friends, at the most economical price. The water supply so vital to a large population has been maintained, as I say. with excellence. It is a tribute to local government and to the men and women who serve in local government that such a standard has been maintained over the years and that such a service was provided in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now it seems that the Government propose that the excellent service—the water industry in Birmingham—is to be removed from the democratic control of elected members of the local authority and placed in the hands of people not directly responsible to the electors. One
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>726</span>
can predict with certainty that any such change cannot bring about an improvement in the water service of Birmingham. It is the same pattern re-emerging as with the general local government proposals. Change there is to be. but change which no one with any knowledge of the subject at all can believe will be to the benefit of the city.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the question of land. Another prediction one can make, if the Bill becomes law, is that there will be a continuing crisis about the supply of land to solve Birmingham's problems. The whole history of the last 20 years shows that the counties have always proved themselves unable to provide land in sufficient quantity to meet the dire needs of the City of Birmingham. I laving spent eight months as the Minister of State for Housing and local Government, I may say that that is not a situation unique to Birmingham. It is central to the argument about the future of local government, because the same story repeats itself throughout the country. The counties cannot do it because their electorate will not allow them to do it. Even if the will exists and it is not often obvious that it does the electorate of the county authorities will not allow them to provide land in sufficient quantities for the building of municipal houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of land and its availability is something which we have discussed before. I remember that when we had the Bill for the abolition of the Land Commission my right hon. Friend and I expressed grave misgivings that although the Government were setting out to destroy the Land Commission, unless they put some sort of mechanism in its place, land would not be forthcoming in sufficient quantity to solve the great shortage in our industrial areas. At the time, both the Minister for Local Government and Development and the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment took these statements far too lightly and said that they would prove to be unfounded. We have now had one more year's experience since the Land Commission was abolished, and what do we see at the end of a year?—every sign of panic on the Government benches that the worst fears we put forward were being realised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

panicking, he ought to be ashamed of himself, because one year after the abolition of the Land Commission—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marcus Fox</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Good riddance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says "Good riddance", but one year after its abolition I defy the hon. Gentleman or any of his ministerial colleagues to tell us where the counties have voluntarily brought forward land for solving the problems of the industrial conurbation. We shall be able to come back to this matter on the Floor of the House, Sir Stephen, and you would not want us to trespass too far, but it is germane to the whole problem of the availability of land in this country. Indeed, the Government acknowledge this in the White Paper which they issued. I want to quote paragraph 6 of the Government's own White Paper of February, 1971 which laid down the criterion by which they said the future pattern of local government was to be determined:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The division between counties and county boroughs has prolonged an artificial separation of big towns from their surrounding hinterlands for functions whose planning and administration need to embrace both town and country"</p></blockquote>
In many ways, those are impeccable sentiments, but the whole of Birmingham is now asking a series of very searching and relevant questions about the implementation of that philosophy in this White Paper. The whole of Birmingham wants to know how the Government can remove this artificial separation in respect of the biggest town in the country outside London. We have had no explanation of how the drawing of these boundaries so tightly and in a way so far different from the proposals in the White Paper meets the requirements of this criterion in the White Paper. It is not just the politicians in Birmingham who are asking these questions; it is the Chamber of Commerce, the trade unions and, indeed, all who speak for the city in any capacity at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This raises another question on which we expect an answer today. Why have the Government deserted the boundary proposals of their own White Paper of a year ago. of February, 1971? That White Paper proposed the sort of boundaries that have found expression in our Amendment today—not exactly, perhaps, but the sort of boundaries. People in Birmingham, particularly people like Sir Francis Griffin, the leader of the Conservative
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>728</span>
Party, and all his colleagues in Birmingham, want to know the answer to the question. What happened between the publication of the White Paper by this Government in February, 1971 and the publication of the Bill and its proposals which were so different in respect of Birmingham a few months later in November, 1971? What happened in those nine months? I know that nine months is a very pregnant period of time. I know that abortion is fashionable, but one never expected the Government's own proposals to be aborted in the way they have been in respect of the City of Birmingham between those two dates. We are left at the moment to make our guess.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the Minister will tell us later on, but I shall start by making my guess. The first of my guesses is that the counties put on the pressure, and I think there is a great deal of evidence for this supposition. They won their main battle in respect of Birmingham before the city had even a chance to get in the ring. They won their battle behind ministerial closed doors when nobody knew what was going on. Therefore, the land requirements which the Government have proposed to make for Birmingham had been cancelled out, not as a result of any independent inquiry by an inspector into boundaries or open discussion about the future of government, but as a result of some horse trading, some dealing, some pressures—we can only guess—which went on behind closed doors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it is relevant to point out here again that this is also the first time in history that the boundaries of our local authorities are being determined not on the basis of an independent report, nor on the basis of open proposals to which the public and interested parties can object, can be represented by counsel and can question their validity. All the boundaries in the Bill are nothing more nor less than the political imposition by the Government of the day upon the whole of local government in this country. I do not think that has ever happened before and, in view of the situation that has occurred in Birmingham, there are the gravest misgivings about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have already sold Birmingham short and, in doing so, they have shattered confidence throughout the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0400">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>729</span>
city that Birmingham will get fair play. It is no use for Ministers, when this crisis comes into the open, to send such people as the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hall Green (Mr. Eyre) to see local Conservative leaders in order to assure them that, if they withdraw their objection, the Ministers will see that land in sufficient quantity is made available to the city of Birmingham for its purposes. According to the 	<i>Birmingham Evening Mail</i> and the 	<i>Birmingham Post,</i> they were told by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hall Green: "You will get land in Minworth or Earlswood". Nobody believes this story. If the Government can change their minds in this way between February and November, any suggestion that the Government believe that their word should be relied upon will get short shrift in the city.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, however, a much more important matter, as I said in the House, than that of whether the Government intend to let Birmingham have land at Minworth, Earlswood or anywhere else. It is that, if the Government gave any such assurances, as the hon. Member well knows, it would be a complete negation of the whole of our planning and independent planning tribunal procedure in this country—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I am glad that the hon. Member is saying, "Precisely", but when I challenged him in the House and I sent a note to the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hall Green to ask him to explain his statements that appeared in the Birmingham press, neither the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hall Green nor the Minister sitting there at the time thought it right to give the House any explanation of this extraordinary series of events.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to know, therefore, what went on and what message the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hall Green conveyed. He must have conveyed some message. The Birmingham press is a remarkably accurate institution for which I have the highest regard. It does not normally conjure stories out of the air. It would not say that the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hall Green had suddenly arrived in Birmingham with some cock-and-bull story unless there was substantive evidence. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will let us into the secret of what happened on that occasion. If he cannot, we
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>730</span>
are left to draw the worst possible conclusions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we consider Chelmsley Wood, which is an important part of this question, the evidence of Conservative inaction does not inspire us with any faith that land will be available in sufficient quantities to solve Birmingham's problems. The last Conservative Government dillied and dallied for years over the question of Chelmsley Wood. Most of the land there happened to be owned by a large building contractor in my constituency and, on his behalf. I made repeated representations to a series of Conservative Ministers, saying that Birmingham could not solve its problems unless this land was allowed to Birmingham to be built upon, but we never got any decision from those Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a matter of fact—I do not say this as party political rubbish—it was not until my right hon. Friend, the leader of the Opposition, arrived in Birmingham and made a pledge that a future Labour Government would release Chelmsley Wood to them for building, that we began to get anywhere. I am glad to say that, when that Labour Government took office in 1964, the present leader of the Opposition saw to it that that pledge was kept by my right hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, East (Mr. Crossman) and the land at Chelmsley Wood was made available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Neither does the story of North Worcestershire exactly fill us with confidence—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Michael Heseltine)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I followed the hon. Gentleman's argument, the practice of politicians making pledges about land release is a complete negation of all our statutory planning application procedures in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not at all. My right hon. Friend the leader of the Opposition said that land would be made available for Birmingham housing and that pledge was kept. The land produced was the land in Chelmsley Wood and the appropriate procedures were, of course, followed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove (Mr. Terry Davis) will have his own views on the recent ministerial announcement about the future availability of land in North Worcestershire. Whichever view he takes, however, I am
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0401">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>731</span>
sure that he will understand that this too is part of a story of disenchantment on the part of the city with the central Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The expectation within the city was that there would be a much larger area of land in North Worcestershire made available to Birmingham for its housing needs. Indeed, Birmingham was happy to accept the ministerial decision on North Worcestershire in the knowledge and belief that it would retain the ownership of Chelmsley Wood and the lands associated with it. The fact that Birmingham's civic leaders, of all political complexions, believe that they were led up the garden on this one is another example of the things that have led to the disastrous loss of confidence between the city and the Government on these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the things we have to decide this morning is whether Chelmsley Wood, Kingshurst and Castle Bromwich are to come into the city of Birmingham or be taken into the borough of Solihull. The city has built 16,000 houses in Chelmsley Wood and Kingshurst. The people who live in them are Birmingham people: all their links are with Birmingham, their families and friends are in Birmingham, they work in Birmingham and they want to be in Birmingham. Why should they be put into Solihull against their will?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member is looking round for advice. He has probably received the latest statement of the Kingshurst local authority which, according to a copy that I have here, was made by that parish on 10th January, 1972. The members of the parish of Kingshurst made it clear that they wished their authority to go into Birmingham, whatever their previous misgivings had been. They have set out here many of their reasons, which I shall come to shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the hon. Member for Meriden (Mr. Speed) is here, because he represents this constituency and he will, no doubt, wish to take part. I hope that there is no difficulty over that. I know, Sir Stephen, that it is not the practice for Government Whips to speak, but, in view of the fact that I have some hard things to say about the hon. Gentleman's proposals, I think that it would be acceptable to the Committee if he intervened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that he can speak for himself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>732</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to hear that the Minister intends that he should speak for himself. I will not hazard any guesses as to why, of all the Whips, the hon. Member for Meriden is the Government Whip on the Committee. I will leave that to the imagination of hon. Members. In view of the story that has been unfolded so far, one can only say that he will certainly be of assistance to his colleagues when he does speak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the things which the Kingshurst Parish Council says about the hon. Member for Meriden is that it has grave doubts about all these proposals and particularly about the ownership of municipal houses in their area—
	<br><blockquote><p>"… grave doubts expressed without one authoritative answer either from our Member of Parliament or the Minister concerned".</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member is not, of course, to blame. If he cannot get answers from his Government he cannot give a satisfactory explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn back to the activities of the other Whip who is involved—the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hall Green. Under the proposals in the Government's White Paper of February, 1971, several wards in his constituency were to be moved into the county borough of Solihull. There was a great shout of disbelief, led by the hon. Gentleman—in which many of us joined—at proposals that parts of Hall Green and Acocks Green should be moved out of Birmingham into Solihull.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can only hazard a guess as to why the Government did this in their original proposals. The whole of this argument, and the whole of this chicanery, centres around the fact that Solihull is too small to stand on its own feet as a county borough. By one means or another Ministers are determined that Solihull shall stand independent of Birmingham and shall be buttressed up, in terms of population, by hook or by crook.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, we had the astounding proposition that wards in Birmingham should be put into Solihull. One can imagine the scene when that was promulgated. One can imagine the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hall Green running around to see his ministerial colleague to ask what he was up to—was he out to destroy his parliamentary constituency? There would be no Hall Green left if these proposals went through! One can imagine the sym-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0402">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>733</span>
pathetic ear with which the Minister received those plaintive cries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government decided to drop the proposals that half of Hall Green should be put into Solihull, but that put them in a dilemma. They then had to decide what they should do to sustain Solihull if the Hall Green ward were left in Birmingham. If they were handing Hall Green, Acocks Green and Foxhollies back to Birmingham, there must be a makeweight to prop up Solihull. The makeweight consists of Chelmsley Wood, Kingshurst and Castle Bromwich. If Birmingham was to have its built-up wards back, it was to lose the land in those areas, because only by adding those parishes to Solihull could the necessary population figures be produced to sustain an independent Solihull.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So it is, Sir Stephen, that two Government Whips have been satisfied—the hon. Member for Meriden (Mr. Speed) and the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hall Green. However, the people who live there are most unhappy. What a way this is in which to approach the future solution of local government in a great area such as the Midlands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the question of the ownership of the houses in Chelmsley Wood and Kingshurst. Birmingham has been denied the land on which to build to solve its housing problem. We have not yet heard any authoritative Government statement, if these boundaries are confirmed, about what will happen to the ownership of the houses which Birmingham holds in those areas. I shall listen with great interest to what the Minister has to say. He cannot determine the future of boundaries unless he tells us what Government policy intentions are about the future ownership of the houses within those areas, especially since 16,000 of those houses are owned by the City of Birmingham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is very simple: if Birmingham loses the land because the Government have drawn the boundaries too tightly around the conurbation, and if Birmingham also loses the re-letting of the 16,000 houses in Chelmsley Wood and Kingshurst, we are sounding the deathknell to the hopes of thousands of over-crowded slum-dwellers and homeless people within the city. This is a matter of the gravest importance to the whole city. We should like a statement of policy about these boundaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>734</span>
It is not without considerable interest that, when the local authorities of Meriden, Kingshurst and Chelmsley Wood decide their attitude, the thing that they regard as most important is that they should be able to serve on the housing committee of the authority which owns their houses. Nobody can say that that is an extravagant demand. It is a facility available to most local authority tenants in the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see, therefore, how we can finally decide the boundaries of these areas until we have some idea of Government thinking in respect of this major social question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I next turn to the question of the National Exhibition Centre and the airport—two matters of grave and major importance for Birmingham. The most ludicrous part of the proposals for the city is the Government's decision so far involving the National Exhibition Centre and Eldon Airport in the parish of Bickenhill. It is now proposed that these two great and vital buildings should be transferred to the ownership or control of Solihull.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On any basis of equity or intelligent thinking, when local government is being reformed in the Midlands, Birmingham should be able to have within its city boundaries that area of land housing the National Exhibition Centre and the airport which is being almost exclusively financed with Birmingham money. Under the proposals before us the position is ludicrous. It is suggested that Birmingham should provide the nation with its National Exhibition Centre and it should provide the West Midland region with its main airport. Birmingham should finance this operation and the whole of the rateable value income should go to the benefit of the people of Solihull who are taking on no such burdens. I shall be interested to hear the defence of this suggestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the very least the Government can do in this respect is to agree that Bickenhill should come into Birmingham. If the Government do not agree to Birmingham having the ownership of the land on which the Exhibition Centre and the airport stand, it is my belief that public opinion in Birmingham will turn very sour at the prospect of the city continuing to finance the prosperity of its
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0403">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>735</span>
neighbours to its own detriment. That is what is enshrined within these boundary proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Speed</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To clarify my mind, is the hon. Gentleman talking about the ownership or the local government area in which the enterprises reside? He mentions the "ownership" of the land. As far as I am aware, there is nothing in this Bill that transfers the ownership of the airport.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I realised when I used the word "ownership" that I should qualify it. When the hon. Gentleman looks in the OFFICIAL REPORT, I think that he will see that I did qualify it with other words. I am glad of the opportunity to make it quite clear that I am talking both about the ownership of the National Exhibition Centre and the airport and about the location of the land on which they stand. I had hoped that my meaning would have been self-evident from what I was saying. It would be quite ludicrous for Birmingham to finance the nation's Exhibition Centre and the region's airport and for all that rateable value to go to another authority which is not accepting any of the financial obligations which the Government and the region expect the people of Birmingham to bear. There can be no case at all for leaving Bickenhill out of the City of Birmingham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to spend more time at this moment on the exhibition centre and the airport because we would like to hear the Government's thinking on it before we say more. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Carter), particularly, has spent some time investigating the financial arrangements and their importance to the venture, and I hope that, if he catches your eye, Sir Stephen, he will be able to elaborate a little more upon them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the question of Sutton Coldfield and Solihull. We have to consider Sutton Coldfield and Solihull as well as Birmingham and the other authorities that I have mentioned. Neither of these towns would exist without Birmingham. They owe their prosperity to Birmingham. Their present development, the nice suburban opportunities which their citizens have—and good luck to them; I do not envy them or think that, on the whole, people in Birmingham envy them—is all
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>736</span>
owed to the industrial prosperity of the city of Birmingham. When they seek to remain independent, I hope that no part of their case is in any way a reflection on the city of Birmingham. The city of Birmingham has done a lot for Sutton Coldfield and Solihull.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have said before that not the least of the things which the ratepayers of Birmingham have done for Sutton Coldfield and Solihull is to provide expensive motorways, so that the people of Sutton and Solihull can go into Birmingham and earn their living and out again with their salaries as fast as they possibly can back to the nice, pleasant suburban neighbourhoods in which they live. That financial burden has been borne by Birmingham and not by Sutton Coldfield or Solihull.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have, of course, to consider their wishes. One does not want to ride roughshod over their wishes. Here we are back again, essentially, to the question of the size of district councils in metropolitan areas. I am very sorry that the Minister has dug his heels in—so, at least, he seems to me to have done—against having a district council in a metropolitan area with a population of under 175,000. That, I think he said, was the smallest population of a district council when I asked him on a previous occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could get this right. The smallest is Southfields with 177,000, which is much below our criterion. We certainly would not want to go below that or to repeat it anywhere. Our criterion is 250,000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to the hon. Gentleman for reaffirming Government policy and for confirming my impression that 177,000—I said 175,000—is the minimum population which the Government have so far been able to accept as a viable district council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that those figures should be a hard and fast rule in the way in which the Government take them to be. If local government is being planned 50 years ahead, as the Government say they are doing, and if 250.000 is to be the mean average size of a district council, when a district council or town can be seen to be capable of being built up and developed to reach that level, it makes some sense to start with a smaller number than 250,000 and to allow natural growth in order to reach it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0404">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>737</span>
One of the questions which we have to discuss—I imagine that those in Sutton Coldfield and Solihull who do not want to come into Birmingham will be asking this—is whether, in view of the criterion that the Minister has just laid down, there is a possibility of growth within each of those towns so that it can, within reasonable time, reach the Government's criterion. A case can be made out that it could happen with both of them. It would mean development. In the case of Sutton Coldfield, it would mean that, for the first time, it would have to start developing on a wider social pattern of housing than it has done so far; I do not know what it would think about it, but it would need the injection into the town of some local authority tenants from Birmingham and probably the Black Country. I imagine that that, although they would not like it, is something they would be prepared to stomach, because it will happen anyway. If Sutton Coldfield comes into Birmingham, there must be some development in Sutton, because it will be about the only place left for Birmingham to get any land to solve its problems. I think that this has to be said openly and honestly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do I understand that the right hon. Gentleman foresees Birmingham building on Sutton Park?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I mean no such thing. I am glad to tell the hon. Gentleman that I shall come to Sutton Park in due course. I have taken the liberty, although he may think that I have spoken at some length, of writing my speech out rather more fully than I normally do. One of the reasons is that I did not want to be aggressively hostile to the Government in my choice of language: I wished to present a strong case with the greatest moderation, and I felt that if I assisted myself in that task you, Sir Stephen, at least might appreciate what I was trying to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some respects, Sutton Coldfield and Solihull have been more progressive than my own city of Birmingham; particularly, in Solihull, in respect of the provision for youth service and sport; they have a service which is superior to that in Birmingham, from which we can learn. Sutton, also, has a good record in respect of its youth service, and it seems to be doing more in sport. I noticed, among
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>738</span>
the first grants of the new Sports Council, one to build a sports centre in Sutton Park. I do not know what the Minister for Local Government and Development has to say about that; it is to be built on a small portion of the park which until now has been used as a fun fair. It is a proposal which shows that Sutton, anyway, takes sporting provision seriously, and this causes me to warm to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the great advantages of Sutton coming into Birmingham is that we shall terminate the disgraceful 11-plus policy which is followed in the county borough of Sutton, which is even worse than that of Birmingham. I receive more complaints, as I did when I was Under-Secretary of State for Education and Science for five years, about the inability of people in Sutton to get their children into high schools and grammar schools, and the system that obtains there for deciding where places should be allocated, than about almost anywhere else in the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yet the fact remains that, on any rational assessment, both Sutton Coldfield and Solihull are an integral part of the conurbation of Birmingham. I do not think that Solihull has inevitably to stand on its own feet, nor that it should not be allowed to develop and build up, and to remain outside Birmingham. This is one of the other possibilities which the Committee has to discuss and to decide upon. We should certainly like to hear the Government's views before we reach a decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the grave objections to Sutton Coldfield coming into Birmingham, as I understand it, is described in this morning's 	<i>Birmingham Post,</i> which tells me that my old friend and political opponent, the right hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield has been active as one would expect him to be, in the interests of his constituents, trying jealously to guard their interests. I understand from the 	<i>Birmingham Post</i> that he must have been saying to the Minister yesterday: "What about Sutton Park?" Having some knowledge of the right hon. Gentleman, I can only say that he must have said it with such force that he produced an instinctive reaction from the Minister this morning, who jumped up and said "What about Sutton Park?" in the middle of my speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am glad that the Minister said, "Hear, hear". This shows that we are united on this on both sides of the House. The citizens of Sutton can rest assured that none of us wants to see the destruction of such a magnificent national asset and natural park as this is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much though I want to see provision made for sport, we all recognise that the larger the industrial conurbation, the more imperative it is that there should be these large natural parks where people can go and do nothing, can kick a ball around, can ride horses and swim in the pool—all the things that people want to do on their own without being involved in organised sport. I hope that Sutton Park does not create a barrier between us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Sutton comes into Birmingham there will be one great advantage on a matter which has long been a grievance with the people of Birmingham. That is that perhaps we shall no longer have to pay to go into this wonderful park. One of the grievances of the people of Birmingham is that they have free access to the libraries and all sorts of other institutions, and accessibility to our theatre, our orchestra and our cultural heritage, but that when we go to enjoy the cultural heritage of Sutton we have to pay an entrance fee.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>740</span>
It is not the amount of money we are asked to pay which concerns the Birmingham people, but the distinction between enjoying a national heritage freely if one is a resident of Sutton and having to pay to enjoy it if one comes from Birmingham or elsewhere. These questions have to be resolved and the strong feelings of the residents in Sutton and Solihull have to be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other ideas which have been mooted which should be mentioned if we are to discuss this properly. One idea, which has a large amount of support in Birmingham, is the proposal that Redditch should be joined to Solihull. This is not a proposal that the Opposition have thought it right to embrace, not only because my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove sits here, but mainly because it would involve the transfer of Redditch from one county to another, which is a matter of some considerable importance in local government terms. However, it ought to be mentioned as one of a number of proposals that have been put forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from the questions of principle which I have raised today and to which we should like to have an answer today, there is a number of ideas that we should like to see the Government examine in detail and come back to at Report stage, unless they can give us full explanations as to why they have chosen one solution to these problems rather than another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must make it clear, however, speaking for the Opposition, that central to the whole situation in the Birmingham conurbation, the key to the whole issue, is the future of Chelmsley Wood, Kingshurst and Bickenhill. We believe that those authorities ought to remain in the area of the Birmingham District Council. Unless that happens it will be impossible for Birmingham to perform its role to the advantage of its one million citizens and it will not be in the economic interests of the nation as a whole. Perhaps both Sutton and Solihull ought to be in Birmingham if one is to take an entirely logical position, but I can well understand the point of view of people who might say that the city would be far too big if that happened; that is the view of many sound judges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much depends upon metropolitan and regional planning policy. It might be possible to put Sutton Coldfield into Walsall if it does not want to come into Birming-

ham and if Sutton is too small to stand on its own, or even to put Sutton Coldfield into West Bromwich. However, that also would mean transferring Sutton Coldfield from one county into another. At any rate, if the hazards of living with Birmingham are too great to be borne by the citizens of Sutton Coldfield, perhaps this is an idea which they have not yet dared to think about but which should be faced up to the not-too-distant future. We have yet to hear any pronouncement from the Government on the subject of metropolitan and regional planning policy upon which it all depends.

If he is encouraging me to conclude he might find himself faced with another embarrassing half hour; I came down with this briefcase full of papers, which he will be glad to know I was able to condense into ten short papers, but if he would like to hear a rather fuller statement of the Birmingham case, I am quite prepared to pull the rest of the papers out of my briefcase. I am sure that is not what he wants; he is anxious to go and vote with the Opposition against the Common Market later on the Floor of the House, and we understand his situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much depends on the metropolitan and regional planning policy, the structure plans about which we have yet heard so little. I hope that the Minister will take this opportunity to tell us something of his views so that we can reach intelligent conclusions based on policy views as to the boundaries which we ought to embrace in these proposals. I hope that the Minister will feel able to do that at an early stage in our proceedings so that we can follow up the defence of these extraordinary proposals about Birmingham.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Speed</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Committee—I am sure that they will understand this somewhat unusual occurrence of a person who is normally encouraging his colleagues to keep silent actually giving forth on this occasion—but I feel that many things that have been said by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) really must be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>742</span>
put straight, so that we know the facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over these past few months, with national exhibition centres, airports, local government re-organisation, motorways and a number of other things, I have been gettng rather tired of sitting in silence, certainly in this place, and seeing my constituency carved up by all sorts of people for all sorts of motives. Therefore, I feel a sense of relief and release that I can now say something to the Committee about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First of all, perhaps I could deal with one of the salient points. The hon. Member for Small Heath, both on Second Reading of this Bill and again this morning, has referred—I think I took his words accurately—to "the history of the counties unable to supply land to Birmingham"; he has criticised the counties in the West Midlands for not helping Birmingham with their housing problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know what his hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove (Mr. Terry Davis) or my hon. Friends the Members for Cannock (Mr. Cormack) and Brierley Hill (Mr. Montgomery) may have to say about it. All I know is that, in 1966, the population of my own constituency was 100,000 people; today it is virtually 200,000. In five years that population has doubled, largely, if not completely, as a result of housing people, and not only in local authority houses, who have come out of Birmingham. I am sure the hon. Member would not make the mistake of thinking that the only way one can help Birmingham's housing problems is by council houses; private development is also important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1966, places like Kingshurst, Chelmsley Wood and Fordbridge—particularly Chelmsley Wood—were green fields and woods. This is now. a very large community, a town the size of Worcester or Nuneaton, and it has been built in five years. Kingshurst was an earlier Birmingham overspill development with many thousands of people coming into Warwickshire. Tamworth, in my constituency, is still co-operating in a massive overspill scheme, doubling its population by 1980, probably doubling it again by the year 2000 and has already provided homes, running into thousands, for Birmingham people. I resent this constant claim that nobody outside Birmingham ever does anything to help the Birmingham housing problem. It is just not true.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0407">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>743</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would understand the hon. Gentleman's resentment if it were not true. The fact is that in his constituency it happens to be true. The hon. Gentleman cannot tell us of any single occasion when his local authority voluntarily agreed to produce land for Birmingham's needs. Chelmsley Wood and Kingshurst have been built up in the remarkable manner in which he says they have as a result of a C.P.O.'s inquiries and decisions of political Ministers which have to be imposed on his local authorities, and he knows it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Speed</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will give the hon. Gentleman a case straight away. The Borough Council of Tamworth, which has been under both Labour and ratepayer control, and which is in my constituency, has co-operated and will continue to do so in providing land—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] Tamworth is also in my constituency, so I see this at both ends. One must also bear in mind the fact, which I keep having to reiterate and which somehow does not get through, that it is private housing as well as local authority housing that can genuinely help in problems of overspill. Not everyone in Birmingham who needs re-housing necessarily wants a council house. As the hon. Gentleman knows, there are many people in Birmingham—and this is one of the problems and the tragedies—who would like to buy their own homes, but their own homes to buy are not available. That is why they come to places like Kingsbury, Coleshill and other parts of my constituency to buy these homes, and this is directly helping Birmingham's housing case. I hope that we can at least put that on the record, and I am sure the hon. Member for Bromsgrove and my hon. Friends can tell similar stories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I come to the main point of my remarks with regard to these Amendments, I should like to say something about public opinion in the western part of my constituency. The hon. Gentleman made great play with the Kingshurst Parish Council's recent decision, which I may say has been roundly criticised by some members of his own party and the local Press. He did not actually read out the voting figures, but I think it was carried by a majority of one to support Kingshurst going into Birmingham. I stress "going into" Birmingham, because up to now it never has been in Birmingham. I am not a member of the Kings-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>744</span>
hurst Labour Club, and I doubt if they would welcome my application if I applied to join. Therefore, I am not privy to all that goes on in the meetings that occur on Sunday mornings there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I do know very well is that I have had not one letter from Kingshurst, Chelmsley Wood, Fordbridge, Bickenhill or Castle Bromwich in favour of going in to Birmingham. I have had very many letters against proposals as originally outlined in the Government's White Paper earlier this year. A poll was conducted by one of the independent county councillors for Chelmsley Wood, who is a member of the Church of England and has no political allegiance—I do not know his politics—and that poll showed that the majority of people were against going into Birmingham. I know that the leader of the Labour minority group on the Meriden Rural District Council, which runs this area, has himself met the Secretary of State, has spoken to me many times and was in favour of the Meriden compromise proposal which was subsequently largely accepted by the Government, which is that all these parishes should go to Solihull. Indeed, I believe that at a recent meeting of the Meriden Rural District Council, he was the person who so moved that proposal. Therefore, we have all-party agreement certainly at the rural district council that control us. I know that many of my Labour friends in this western part of my constituency are very much in favour of the new proposals of merging with Solihull. As far as public opinion is concerned, I am afraid that I cannot accept only the decision of the Kingshurst Parish Council as being representative of the overwhelming wish of my constituents in that part of the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendments are in two parts. There is the one in the name of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Carter), which, I think, relates largely to the airport and National Exhibition Centre point, and then there is the one in the name of the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends, which seeks to return to the position set out in the White Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Taking the question of returning to the position of the White Paper, in fact it does not go back that far because already the four wards that the hon. Gentleman has mentioned are now back into Birming-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0408">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>745</span>
ham—wards which were going into Solihull—so Birmingham has that much back already and is now intact. Birmingham is also, as there is no Amendment from the hon. Gentleman to the contrary, going to take unto itself Sutton Coldfield. Birmingham also, if the hon. Gentleman's Amendment is passed, will take a substantial section of the western part of my constituency, part of which at the moment is going to Solihull and part of which is staying in the County of Warwick. That would mean that Birmingham, which is already by far the largest metropolitan district council, will increase its population perhaps by another 200,000 people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that among certain commercial companies and perhaps among certain Members of Parliament there is a feeling that big is beautiful; they follow the cult of greatness. I also have a feeling that a reaction is setting in and that a number of people are questioning whether bigger and bigger companies or local authorities or anything else are necessarily the best way of dealing with very human problems like housing, emptying of dust bins, street lights or whatever it may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At this stage, I wonder whether Birmingham with Sutton Coldfield is not already too big. I am quite convinced that if Birmingham took another half of my constituency it would certainly be too big to give the sort of personal service that people would wish to have. When one looks at the number of councillors who can be appointed—one cannot have a council chamber of 500 people—obviously the work load upon them, trying to view it with even greater and greater numbers means that one will have something like one councillor per 20,000 population. With the sort of problems in this area, I simply do not believe that that is a feasible proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had various statements in the local Press about the rates for Birmingham, and all the rest of it, but I think it should be pointed out that, as far as Birmingham is concerned, it is still by far the largest metropolitan district council. It has a higher rateable value per head of population than any other, certainly in the West Midlands, at round about £53 per head. In fact, I think that Birmingham has come remarkably well out of these proposals. If we accept the hon. Gentleman's Amendment, first of all Sutton Coldfield is diminished from round about
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>746</span>
200,000 down to about 120,000 or 130,000 population. In my view, that is clearly not viable. In view of what my hon. Friend says, that must be the Department's and the Government's view as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only practical alternative—we all know this, and the hon. Member for Bromsgrove knows it as well as I do—is to bring into Solihull, Redditch and the countryside between. That is the only practical alternative if we are to deprive Solihull of this large number of people and push them into Birmingham. I am sure the hon. Member for Bromsgrove will not accept that. I certainly would not accept it, and there would be a major row. But I think—the hon. Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Howell) can correct me if I am wrong—that that was the other side of the all-party plank in the Birmingham Council Chamber when these things were discussed. Therefore, it is surprising that there is no Amendment down to that effect. However, we understand the reasons, and I pay tribute to the advocacy and the efficiency of the hon. Member for Bromsgrove.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 229 and 238 are a nonsense because they would just deprive Solihull of any prospect of being a viable district council, apart from any other factors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, it goes further than that, because when we then take in Coleshill and Water Orton, where I have had meetings and spoken with the people, in defiance of the overwhelming wish of every inhabitant in Coleshill and Water Orton, and where there the same situation applies, even more so than in Chelmsley Wood, one cannot find one person in those villages who wishes to become part of Birmingham. There is also the physical aspect, because not only are they divided between the conurbation and Water Orton and Coleshill by one motorway at the moment, the M6, but shortly they will be divided by two motorways, because the M42 will come through as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those two parishes are critical to Warwickshire, because again Warwickshire has lost to it Sutton Coldfield and all the metropolitan part of my constituency, a sizeable population and rateable value. To drop not only 6,000 people which by itself is perhaps not very much, but half a million pounds of rateable
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0409">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>747</span>
value with the power stations, industrial estate and all the rest of Coleshill, this will gravely affect Warwickshire. It will also gravely affect the likely determination of the new district council for North Warwickshire which will, of course, be a matter for the Boundary Commission. At the moment, the Atherstone Rural District Council, the Meriden Rural District Council, the Warwickshire County Council and all political parties would like to see a North Warwickshire District Council in which Coleshill will play a key part, both because of its rateable value which will make the new district viable and also because of the excellent council chamber it has which was built within the last decade and which at the present moment serves the Meriden Rural District Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To bring Coleshill and Water Orton into the metropolitan county and into Birmingham, would have to be done in the face of violent hostility from their own residents, would take them right across these two motorways, would gravely affect Warwickshire and its financial viability, and the prospects of creating a sensible North Warwickshire district council when that section of local government reorganisation fell to be considered by the Boundary Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of the airport and the National Exhibition Centre has been raised. No doubt the hon. Member for Northfield will have more to say about that. I cannot accept that in 1972 it suddenly becomes essential for the two enterprises to be situated on land that is physically part of the Birmingham metropolitan district.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Birmingham Airport has been going for nearly as long as I have been alive. I think that it was opened just before the war. I know the director of the airport well, and I visit it frequently. It is in my constituency. I used the airport on New Year's morning to fly to London. Notwithstanding the noise problems which my constituents have, it has been in the Meriden rural district and Warwickshire for about 30 years. Why, in January, 1972, has the situation apparently become quite impossible? Why is the airport to be under an authority that is not part of Birmingham? I do not remember any great agitation to change the situation of the airport until we had the Redcliffe-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>748</span>
Maud Report. Certainly no representations have ever been made to me, as Member of Parliament for the area, about the anomalies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The airport is essentially a regional one. It should be a regional responsibility. The airport has been running at a loss. It is unreasonable that Birmingham should bear all that loss. Any losses or profits should be a regional responsibility. These matters can be discussed, however. They have no relation to the geography of the area in which the airport lies. One thing is clear; Bickenhill will be in the metropolitan county, and I should have thought that the airport should be run by the metropolitan county rather than by any one district.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the original germ of the idea of the National Exhibition Centre was popping round in certain people's minds—and all credit to the people of Birmingham and others for putting the idea forward—the proposed site was in the Meriden rural district, and in Warwickshire. It still is. I am sure that that was not an inhibiting factor when the idea was put forward. In principle, I have always supported the National Exhibition Centre. In so doing I have offended many personal and political friends in the constituency, who naturally do not want to have an enormous enterprise like this dumped on their front doorstep. I have always taken the view that this country needs a major new national exhibition centre and that the West Midlands, which accounts for 40 per cent. of the country's exports, is the right place in which to have it. In view of the communications setup, with the motorways and the rail and air links, this is as good a site as any. Providing that certain safeguards are provided for my constituents I have always supported the proposal for the National Exhibition Centre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must stress, however, that we are talking about a national exhibition centre—not a Birmingham exhibition centre, a Meriden exhibition centre or a Solihull exhibition centre. I readily accept that Birmingham Council and Birmingham Chamber of Commerce have and will continue to put a great deal of money into the project. One of the conditions, however, is that money will also come from the Government. That is what I have been told by Birmingham people. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0410">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>749</span>
State for Trade and Industry has an interest in this matter, and substantial sums of Government money will be coming in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Substantial sums of Government money will also be available for the infrastructure and the new roads, road links and all the rest—which are not being paid for by Birmingham—to serve the exhibition centre. It is nonsense to haggle over a great enterprise like this, on the parochial question whether it is in the rating district of Birmingham or Solihull. It is getting down to parish pump politics. I am sure that an arrangement can be made. It should be made. Ownership is one matter: the question of rateable value and all the services are another. I can see no reason why Bickenhill, now part of Solihull, should remain part of Solihull. I hope that some consideration can be given to the great financial investment that Birmingham has made and will make in the exhibition centre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot agree that a whole parish—I am talking not merely about the airport and the site of the exhibition centre but the village of Bickenhill itself, and the community of Marston Green—should be taken into Birmingham. If the point was so important I should have thought that the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, the Birmingham Council, the D.T.I. or somebody, would have suggested that Bickenhill should go into Birmingham many years ago, when this project was first mooted rather than at this late stage. I cannot believe that the question whether Bickenhill is in Solihull or Birmingham is in any way germane to the question of the site of the National Exhibition Centre. Naturally, it would be administratively tidy and convenient if Bickenhill were in Birmingham, but there are much more important considerations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of Sutton Coldfield has already been mentioned. My right hon. Friend and I have discussed it. because we are neighbours. About two dozen of my constituents reside within the royal borough of Sutton Coldfield. I am just, technically, the hon. Member for a little bit of that borough. My right hon. Friend has been making many representations to the Minister and to others. I have great sympathy with the people of Sutton Coldfield. They do not have an antipathy to Birmingham, as such, but they are worried about size—about losing their true identity and all the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>750</span>
things they have built up for themselves. A great new shopping redevelopment is going through among other things. If it is not possible to find a solution it is unfortunate, obviously it must be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people are very concerned about Sutton Park, to which reference has already been made this morning. I agree that the present administration in Birmingham—or any that one is likely to see in the future—would not be so philistine as to develop Sutton Park. Administrations and local authorities change, however. Who can tell what might happen in 10 or 15 years' time? If it were possible to designate this as Green Belt land, or do whatever is necessary doubly to reassure the people in Sutton—and the people in Birmingham who use Sutton Park—that the Park will remain as a great lung for the city, it would be extremely helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On one point in all this discussion about the western part of my constituency and Chelmsley Wood I am at one with the hon. Gentleman—the question of the ownership of the houses, inasmuch as the representations of the tenants are extremely inadequate at the moment. Some Birmingham houses are situated in Warwickshire, where there are no Birmingham councillors and no direct representation on the housing committee, and they have either to work through rural district county councillors, the housing office that has been set up, or myself. That is not a satisfactory situation. It is taxation without representation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, one cannot then go on to argue that Birmingham must retain control and ownership of these houses even if they go into Solihull. The hon. Gentleman was at one time virtually arguing this; he was talking about the extent to which they were helping with Birmingham's housing programme. Mention has been made of the Kingshurst parish council, which is Labour controlled. The Kingshurst Labour Group of councillors have written to me saying that whatever is the final outcome of the local authority setup the local authority, that is the housing authority—which I hope and believe will be Solihull—must be the owners of those houses, because of the representational point. That is their view. If Chelmsley Wood and Kingshurst went into Birmingham, Birmingham would remain the owners, but they believe that, if Kingshurst and Chelmsley Wood go into Solihull, Solihull must become the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0411">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>751</span>
owners. This is not the stage in the Bill at which that point is determined. I have already had communications with my hon. Friends on the matter. It will arise later and will be determined after local consultations have taken place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can certainly tell my hon. Friends that the overwhelming view of all political parties is that the authority which finally becomes the housing authority must be the owner of those houses, so that we have proper representation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman apply his thinking to the question of the re-lettings? Even if Birmingham loses the houses, would he then say that that must be conditional on Birmingham retaining the right of nomination for the re-lettings? If not, he is proposing that Birmingham should have no land and no re-lettings—the worst of all the fears. He has not said one word about how Birmingham will solve its problems if he gets his way over boundaries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Speed</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was just coming to that. I think that it would be possible. The ownership and the representation of the houses is one thing. I do not think that Birmingham can have the complete right to the re-letting of all Solihull houses, but it should be possible to devise a formula whereby an element of Birmingham nominations can be accepted, as happens in Tamworth at the moment, where Birmingham has a say in the lettings of the houses out at Tamworth and in regard to overspill. Those houses are being built in Tamworth and run by Tamworth Corporation. Birmingham has an arrangement with the authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see a similar situation here. I am sure that if the will is there, Solihull could co-operate in setting up such a scheme. That could also apply, with probably even more flexibility, between the other council houses that Solihull will take over in the Meriden rural district, in places like Hampton, Meriden and Balsall, of which there is quite a number. There could be an increase in flexibility. I accept that there are Birmingham housing problems which have to be faced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everyone talks about "environment"; it is a splendid "in" word, and we are all great environmentalists, but it means taking some harsh decisions. We must
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>752</span>
decide whether we shall solve the city's housing problems by ever-increasing peripheral development 	<i>à la</i> Chelmsley Wood, Whittall, North Worcestershire, and other parts of the country, or by more imaginative schemes, keeping redevelopment as far as possible within the cities and then building—in my view, this is much better—upon existing communities rather than on virgin site new towns; upon places like Tamworth and others that are ready, willing, and eager to accept them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The logic of the hon. Gentleman's argument, and certainly of the Birmingham City Council's argument, is that we go on, as we have in the past, having a great battle with compulsory purchase orders and the rest, and extending the city's boundaries ever-increasingly by peripheral development. That could be environmentally a disaster and it would be wrong because it makes the cities too big, impersonal, and remote. With the best will in the world, however good the Birmingham Housing Department is—I pay tribute to Mr. Atkins and his colleagues for all the work they do—if one is trying to administer hundreds of thousands of council houses, there is a danger—I put it no higher than that—that one will become more inefficient and remote than if one is trying to administer only thousands of council houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both the sub-regional and regional studies have emphasised strongly the importance and urgency of conserving the green belt around Birmingham, and particularly between Birmingham and Coventry, not only for the people living in that area or indeed for those living in Birmingham and Coventry but on national grounds, because that green belt is perhaps one of the most important in the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we do not take a firm stand in drawing lines tightly around the metropolitan county—and even within it, so that there are district councils of a reasonable size—we shall end up, in my part of the world, with the same sort of situation as exists in the Black Country: one great urban sprawl from Wolverhampton to Birmingham, extending down through Coventry and Rugby, joining up with Milton Keynes, and making an urban corridor from Brighton right up to Wolverhampton. That, I believe, would be an environmental disaster.

The proposals in the Bill, which are much better than those in the White Paper, draw the boundaries of the metropolitan county more tightly to meet this point, and it is significant that Coleshill, the Packingtons, and Water Orton would be included in the green belt if it is confirmed, because they are in a designated area at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These proposals maintain the viability of Solihull, which has been a good progressive authority, not least for housewives and other people, has an enlightened policy for car parking and shopping, and an excellent shopping centre which has been built in recent years. It keeps Birmingham to reasonable size; and I do not think that Birmingham, having another 80,000-100,000 people added to it and having the highest rateable value per head in the whole of the West Midlands, can claim that it has been raped. It is a sensible compromise. No solution is perfect. It is a solution that has the overwhelming support of my constituents of all political parties, and I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ray Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the first occasion on this Committee that we have had any real conflict, not only between both sides but, to some extent, among hon. Members on this side. It is not as fierce as some people might expect it to be, but nevertheless Birmingham, as was concisely put by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell), feels slighted by the Government's present proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Meriden (Mr. Speed) gave the Committee numerous details of objections in various parts of his constituency from individuals, groups, and authorities that did not want to become a part of the metropolitan district of Birmingham. One understands that, although I do not think that we could with any certainty say that there was a majority view there. Neither could I say, on the other hand, that the proposal to come into Birmingham is welcomed by a majority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Meriden also went on to ask why we were now considering doing this, that, and the other. We are considering these things because we are about to restructure and reform local government. If we were not, Birmingham would be carrying on, as it is today, with financial expeditions outside
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>754</span>
its boundary, in regard to Chelmsley Wood and the airport. But the Government, being what they are, have decided in the past few days that local government is in need of reform, and it is the view of people in the city of Birmingham that reform in their city should take a certain form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is strange that it is always this side of the Committee that is accused of pulling trees up, and examining the roots, and sticking them back in the ground, and, as a result, upsetting the ecological balances. This is precisely what the Government have done in this case. So far from putting the tree back in its former condition, they have actually pruned the roots. I believe that to be generally the case but more specifically is it the case for Birmingham. As the proposals stand, Birmingham will have added to it another urban area which increases its problems and makes it an even bigger urban sprawl. It has not, as a result of the proposals, been given any ability to cope with its increased problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Birmingham, Small Heath, initially said that Birmingham was united on the proposals. That is certainly true at the local level; I wish that it were true at the Parliamentary level. In fact, not one Conservative Member of Parliament has thought fit to support a local authority which is governed by his own party. The Parliamentary Secretary said, in connection with one of those Conservative Members, that it was not proper, constitutionally or otherwise, for a Minister to agree that in future land would be made available for housing needs. This, he thought, was improper. But one of those Conservative Members had broadcast in Birmingham that that was precisely the kind of undertaking he had been given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was the hon. Gentleman's hon. Friend who was saying that it was totally unconstitutional and therefore totally unacceptable. His hon. Friend then went on to show that the Leader of his own party had himself been doing it earlier. That was why I intervened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very pleased that the Leader of the Opposition did give that undertaking. If he had not, and if the Labour Government had not kept that undertaking, I really do not know what the housing problem of Birmingham
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0413">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>755</span>
would be like today. It would have been most severe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Meriden, who told the Committee that the counties around the city had co-operated with the city of Birmingham to solve its housing needs, knows Birmingham better than I do. He has been there longer. Birmingham has been plagued over the years, since the war, by its inability to get the right degree of co-operation with surrounding counties. That has been the case most recently in the North Worcestershire area. We have had to rely on compulsory purchase orders in order to satisfy the housing needs of Birmingham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the hon. Gentleman would agree that that is not a satisfactory situation. It should be put right. One cannot leave a fundamental human problem such as housing at the behest of compulsory purchase orders; we should attempt to deal with it in a rational way. That is precisely what we ought to be doing now, when we are considering the reform of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Birmingham, on the basis of the present proposals, will be left in the future in precisely the same position as we are in now—that is, having to go outside our boundaries in order to solve our housing needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whilst I am on that question, 	<i>vis-à-vis</i> Chelmsley Wood, may I remind the Minister of what he said on Tuesday in connection with Washington, Co. Durham:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This new town is part of the conurbation. It was built to provide a focal point for the renewal of that conurbation, it is firmly within that built-up area, at the hinge between Tyneside and Wearside and, with great respect. it would be a planning nonsense to have it in Durham and not within the conurbation."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee D,</i> 18th January, 1972; 	<i>c.</i> 712.]</p></blockquote>
Chelmsley Wood is in precisely that same situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Chelmsley Wood remains within the conurbation. I did not say, for example, that Washington should be part of Newcastle any more than Chelmsley Wood should necessarily be part of Birmingham. Chelmsley Wood remains in the conurbation in the same way as Washington remains in the conurbation about which we were speaking on Tuesday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was thinking of it from
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>756</span>
a strictly housing point of view. The district of Birmingham will be responsible for housing. That being the case, taking the principle of the Minister's argument on Tuesday and relating it to Chelmsley Wood, I cannot see how he can support that proposition for Washington but deny it to Chelmsley Wood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following what the hon. Member for Meriden (Mr. Speed) had to say, it seems to me that one of the principal difficulties, if not the principal difficulty, that we should be trying to resolve now is the conflict between town and country. I accept all the points that he made about the environment, about the need to plan. I do not think he used the word "plan", but I think we should. I also accept his points about inhibiting the sprawl and growth of the great conurbations and the additional point that we should find much of our future housing needs in and around small villages, small communities, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, in the immediate future we are looking to solving our housing needs on the basis of present philosophy, as embodied in the Bill. Birmingham will not be able to solve its housing needs within the framework of the Bill. Its task will be made infinitely more difficult with the addition of another urban area, that of Sutton Coldfield. My right hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) reminded the Committee of paragraph 6 of the Government's White Paper. As far as Birmingham is concerned it is central to any resolution of the difficulties between town and country. It said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The areas of many existing authorities are out-dated and no longer reflect the pattern of life and work in modern society. The division between counties and county boroughs has prolonged an artificial separation of big towns from their surrounding hinterlands for functions whose planning and administration need to embrace both town and country."</p></blockquote>
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the White Paper and everything that the Government have said so far. that is a central principle within the Bill. Clearly, as far as Birmingham is concerned, it has been completely ignored. As is said in the explanatory notes that we were given by the Minister, Birmingham is the biggest of all the metropolitan districts. It is recognised that the size of problems faced
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0414">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>757</span>
by an authority is directly proportional to the size of the authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is sad to relate, therefore, that, faced with that known fact and past experiences, the Government have run away from the real solution to Birmingham's problems. How can an authority like Birmingham, with a population of over one million, with no land in which to expand, solve its housing, recreation, leisure and other public utility problems? It is virtually impossible. If the Bill becomes law, the City of Birmingham will find itself in a year's time in precisely the position it is in now—one of acute difficulty with the necessity of having to go outside its borders in order to solve its problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my right hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham. Small Heath pointed out, the Maude Report, the Labour Government's White Paper and, indeed, this Government's White Paper issued last February faced up fairly and squarely to all the problems that the City of Birmingham faced. By and large most opinion in Birmingham, including the City Authority, was in favour of most of those proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, that pregnant period to which my right hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Small Heath referred produced a change in the position. Why? He again dealt with the reason—Solihull. For those who know Birmingham and the Midlands, Solihull is, I suppose, the Wimbledon of Birmingham, or it might be the Hampstead.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not a Hampstead? I think my hon. Friend is right. It is the Wimbledon of the Midlands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are some influential people in Solihull and, on this issue, I would say that they have had an influence upon the Government which goes far beyond the kind of influence that any local authority or any individual should be able to exercise on Government. A great city like Birmingham, Britain's second city, the largest urban area in the country outside London, has had to play second fiddle to the interests of the individuals and the authority of Solihull. This is disastrous. If we want a capital in the West Midlands, surely we should have looked at its problems more closely. There must be an an-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>758</span>
swer today from the Government as to why, during that period of nine months, the whole situation changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My name is on the Order Paper against Amendments Nos. 468 and 469. The Amendments were put down after due consideration. For most people concerned with the problems faced by the City of Birmingham, they represent the irreducible minimum of the city's demands. Everybody appreciates that in terms of local government reorganisation any Government would face difficulties and problems. They had to meet and try to marry up all the entrenched and conflicting interests, and satisfy everyone at one and the same time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that is impossible—although it would have been rather more possible if the Government's proposals had been more radical and more all-embracing. My right hon. Friend the Member for Small Heath dealt with the question on the National Exhibition Centre. This project has been conceived by Birmingham City Council and the industrial side of the city. It was promoted as an idea by the city and has been accepted by both Labour and Conservative Governments as a real proposition. We in Birmingham feel that if we are to be asked to act as a focal point for industrial, commercial and local government activity in the West Midlands we must be given the wherewithal to perform that function.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the people of Birmingham have made such an enormous sacrifice, in terms not only of the airport but the exhibition centre, we feel that we are not being unfair in demanding that those projects and institutions should come within the boundaries of a new district authority. Bickenhill happens to be the area in which both projects are sited, and that small addition to the city boundary would make a great deal of difference to the whole authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As an additional benefit, a small amount of land would be available for housing. It must be emphasised that it could be only a small amount, and could not help to solve Birmingham's long-term housing needs. We know that with the proposed housing developments which should be completed within three or four years Birmingham will once again be faced with a considerable shortfall of housing. I will not deal with housing at any further length because it has been fairly adequate-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0415">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>759</span>
ly covered by my right hon. Friend the Member for Small Heath.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to say more, because I am sure that the Minister will want to reply at length. I merely ask him to give an assurance that the Government will once again reconsider problems that we face in the West Midlands. We do not ask for an instant response this morning, but we do ask the Minister to recognise that the Bill's proposals are quite inadequate to enable the new Birmingham to perform all the functions that will be laid before it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not want to see a neutered urban sprawl which, without the proper ability to solve its problems, will produce an area unattractive to its residents, will probably begin to export its industry, and will lose altogether the attractiveness that a regional capital should have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Birmingham is the regional capital of the West Midlands, and it should be made so. I ask the Minister to bear that point in mind and give us an assurance that he will look further at the problems faced by the city.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is obviously an important debate. All the members of the Committee would want to associate themselves with the general remarks which have been made from both sides about the truly remarkable contribution that Birmingham has made to the fortunes of this country over a very long period of history. I certainly associate myself with that generality, and to include the people whom I have known in my political life who have led that great city, and the remarkable energies and personal dedication they have brought to that job. It does not make it any easier for those of us who have to make difficult and often marginal decisions about the reorganisation of local government to have to disappoint people who have worked so hard for the city that they represent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to say something about the general problems that have been raised and then the specific Amendments. I start with the speech of the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) and the various points that he dealt with. First, there was the very important question—also referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden (Mr. Speed) and the hon. Member for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>760</span>
Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Carter)—of land and the planning future for this particular area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The recent planning permissions granted to the city mean that for the immediate future the housing requirements for the city can be met within its present programme, but there are bound to be continuing demands as the present applications are used up, and we shall obviously need to rely in great measure on the West Midland planning study, which has been published but not yet confirmed—it is still the subject of consultations—in order to indicate clearly where the development of housing and other facilities for the growing population and the slum replacement programmes are to take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State for my own Department has made it absolutely clear that when the South-East joint planning studies have been confirmed it will be the disposition of the Department to grant applications that conform with those studies. In that way it should be possible for the authorities that have the housing powers—the district authorities in this case—to pursue their needs with or without the co-operation of neighbouring authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our prime concern—and I very much agree with the arguments of my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden—is that these great urban areas, together with the rural areas that surround them, should be properly planned, and that development should not take place on an endless sprawl basis—a ribbon development or piecemeal basis round the periphery. There must be a much more coherent strategy. That is the progress that the Government are determined to make, in order that the questions which have rightly been asked can be answered within a framework of proper planning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been asked what happened between the publication of the Government's White Paper and the publication of the Bill. What happened was precisely what the Government anticipated would happen—and, indeed, encouraged to happen. When we published the White Paper we made it clear that it was a consultative document in relation to the boundaries of the districts for the metropolitan counties and the counties themselves. We asked local authorities to let us have their views, so that we could have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0416">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>761</span>
second thoughts where necessary, in the light of representations put to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, in certain difficult areas either the Minister or myself went to listen to the representations of all the local authorities in order that we should best be able to gauge local opinion on the ground. We also had the opportunity to look at the territory, and in many cases to fly over it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The period between the publication of the White Paper and the publication of the Bill produced considerable reaction from the West Midlands against our proposals. Anybody who was at my meeting at Birmingham will remember that these manifestations were made abundantly clear to me by many of the local authorities who came to see me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may generalise, the proposals in the White Paper involve the creation of a Solihull district by adding various parts to the extreme south-east of Birmingham city, Acocks Green and Hall Green. The second thing that happened was that various parts of the Meriden rural district, including the Birmingham housing estates which have been referred to, and the parish of Bickenhill in which the exhibition centre and the airport are included, were moved into the city itself and then other parts of the Meriden rural district were divided either into Solihull or into the new proposed district of Coventry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This was a coherent and understandable set of proposals which we published, believing them to be a practical solution to the problem, but they did not meet the views of the people involved on the ground. I think that the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) must know from following the local Press cuttings that the representations of the people concerned were almost overwhelmingly against what we had published at that time. We listened to the representations that had been put to us and we drew up a new set of proposals, as embodied in this Bill, to take into account the views that had been put to us by the representatives of the local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have one here from the parish of Bickenhill, about which we have heard so much this morning. If I read the last few paragraphs of this letter I think -the Committee will get a flavour of the sort
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>762</span>
of things that were being said to me when I went to the meeting in Birmingham:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Consequently we are opposed to the absorption of Bickenhill Parish into the proposed new District 15(e) which we know by bitter experience will be dominated by the City of Birmingham and urban interests. Our desire is to remain as a Parish in the Meriden District in the County of Warwick. Should this be over-ruled by Government policy the only acceptable alternative is for the Parish of Bickenhill to become part of the Solihull District 15(f) which we know as an authority more sympathetic to our aims and needs".</p></blockquote>
I think the last sentence is very important—
	<br><blockquote><p>"This view has been expressed overwhelmingly at various public meetings held in the Parish".</p></blockquote>
I think this is the point which my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden (Mr. Speed) was making in his admirable contribution. My only regret is that it is not, to my knowledge, to be repeated in this Committee, but I think he expressed the views of his constituents extremely clearly. I hope that that answers the first, and very understandable, question put by hon. Members opposite—what happened in the period between the publication of the White Paper and finally of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would not be what we have come to expect from the right hon. Member for Small Heath if there was not a certain amount of controversy in the statements he makes, and I was not surprised to hear him making veiled references, which became more and more clear as time went on, to the power of the counties. He paid tribute later on, perhaps, to the power of his hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove (Mr. Terry Davis) in supporting those counties, but the idea that the counties in some way made themselves a better deal at the expense of the urban areas makes no sense at all in the light of what the counties were asking for and what they would like to see.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I remind the hon. Member that, as we have seen from the letter I read out, the parish is in Meriden and they want to go back into Warwickshire. The proposal was that Sutton Coldfield should go into Warwickshire, that Halesowen and Stourbridge should go into Worcestershire, that Aldridge-Brownhills should go into Staffordshire. All round the conurbation the counties argued that what we regarded as the essential concept of the metropolitan area should be set right back and that far bigger areas should be transferred to the county. They argued it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0417">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>763</span>
sincerely and I know that they believed it, but the fact is that this Government resisted the pressures of the counties in a large and significant proportion of the cases. I do not think it makes any sense at all to suggest that county pressure was responsible for this particular set of adjustments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I now turn to the difficult question of the Birmingham housing estates in the two particular parishes of Kingshurst and Chelmsley Wood where, as the right hon. Member for Small Heath pointed out, there are some 16,000 council houses which have been built in recent years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Speed</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend talked generically of Chelmsley Wood because that was the name of the development. In fact, Fordbridge and Castle Bromwich parishes have a substantial part of the Chelmsley Wood development within them. Fordbridge is an entirely new development and Castle Bromwich has a substantial part as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful; that is perfectly correct. I am now talking about this area because they all go together for the purposes of this debate as it affects Birmingham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first question I was asked about this, which I should like to answer categorically, was as to the ownership of these houses. The answer is that the ownership of the houses has yet to be decided because it is a difficult issue which has many arguments on both sides. I think my hon. Friend raised some of the representational issues which have to be resolved, and certainly when we get on to the decisions that will be possible under this Bill, when we come to discuss housing, we can argue those out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think the specific point that was raised by the right hon. Member for Small Heath as to the re-lets is important and I do not think there can be any question of Birmingham with its needs losing all interest in the re-lets. Whether this is to be provided by order under the legislation, or involves an agreement with Solihull on nominations, or relies on the reserve powers of the metropolitan county, can be discussed later in the Bill, but I acknowledge the existence here of a problem which we shall certainly seek to resolve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same sort of issues are involved
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>764</span>
when we come to the question of the exhibition centre and the airport. The property which at the present moment is owned by the city will remain with the city. I think that answers the question about ownership, although, of course, it remains in Solihull's area. This is exactly the situation which exists at the moment where both the establishments, or the potential establishment in the case of the exhibition centre, are in Bickenhill parish which is in the County of Warwickshire, within the rural district of Meriden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the specific question about rateable value, I think there are two points to be made. First of all, obviously the city is not developing the exhibition centre simply for the rateable value, which is a rather narrow return, to be drawn from the exhibition centre itself. The city must have in mind the large influx of industrialists and other visitors to an exhibition centre, which, of course, will be of great economic benefit to the hotels and the other service industries in the city, and the various industrial spin-off effects which are too obvious for me to name which could come from making a national exhibition centre in Birmingham. The rateable value which the city would draw from this would completely dwarf any rateable value which it might draw from the site of the exhibition centre itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to leave the matter there. I believe that because of the arrival of local government reorganisation at this time, we would accept that there is an area which needs discussion and I hope that the city and the county borough of Solihull will take the opportunity provided for in the Bill to establish a working group to discuss the implications of the development and the financing of the development that is now the subject of a granted planning application. Certainly, we in the Department would be interested to hear what the outcome of those discussions would be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next question that I was asked concerned the views of Redditch and the possibility of Redditch moving into Solihull if there were to be an adjustment along those lines. This will certainly come up in what I want to say about the Amendments themselves. I have here a letter from the urban district of Redditch which states the position as clearly as I could state it:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Council have considered the suggestion of the Birmingham City Council that the Urban
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0418">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>765</span>
District and part of the Bexley Parish Council area should be combined with Solihull and brought into the Metropolitan County and can find no merit in the suggestion. The road communication is bad and it cannot be said that there is much, if any, community of interest between the Urban District and Solihull".</p></blockquote>
This idea was explored and was not in any way welcomed by the people of Redditch.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Small Heath raised the question of the possibility of Sutton Coldfield and Solihull moving into the City of Birmingham itself. I think this point was answered by my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden when he said that this would create an even greater imbalance between the size of the City of Birmingham, which is incomparably the largest district in rateable value and in population terms within the metropolitan county, and to add both those areas, as opposed to just the addition of Sutton Coldfield as proposed in the Bill, would be greatly to extend the imbalance in a way which we would find unacceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I now turn to the three groups of Amendments themselves—Amendments Nos. 386, 387, 388 and 389, in the name of my right hon. Friend the Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr. Geoffrey Lloyd). May I say at once that the Minister and I greatly appreciate the representations put to us by my right hon. Friend and the very strong feelings which he has represented to us on behalf of his constituents. I think the particular case he has put forward is a difficult one and we have taken great trouble to try to reach the right decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of these Amendments is to create an additional metropolitan district in the West Midlands which would comprise Sutton Coldfield itself, together with parts of the present City of Birmingham, and to take a line approximately down to the Midland Links motorway to give that new proposed district a population of some 220,000 people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The alternative that we are now debating has come up as a conclusion from the inability which we found to accept the suggestion that the borough should move into the new Warwickshire. It was our view, and it remains our view, that the borough of Sutton Coldfield is part of the continuous metropolitan county, and it would be wrong to try to draw an artificial line through this particular urban area. Not only would it have been wrong in the case of this area, but it would have provided a precedent which would have made it impossible to have held the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>766</span>
arguments for the metropolitan areas up and down the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present borough has a population of only 83,000. which is half that of the smallest metropolitan county. They have tried to find for themselves a partner to make it possible for them to come up to the size we have in mind for metropolitan districts. The south-eastern tip adjoins the extreme north-west of Solihull and. therefore, although there is a certain social compatibility between those two areas, it would make the most difficult geographical formation to try to link them together: indeed, it would have a very narrow wasp waist at one particular point with no fewer than three centres within it—the centres of Sutton Coldfield itself, Chelmsley Wood and Solihull. Consequently, we feel that geographically that is not an alternative that would be acceptable, and I think Sutton Coldfield itself would agree with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To the north there is the green belt area and the edge of the conurbation, and so this does not provide an alternative. To the west Aldridge and Brownhills with 88.000 provides the beginning of an argument, but, here again, with the gap between the two and a combined population of only 171,000, this would provide too small an alternative, and it would also have the disadvantage of leaving Walsall on its own which would then leave another metropolitan district with a population of 185,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The alternative is to go into Birmingham to the south, to the Midland Links motorway, along the lines of this particular Amendment and there is no doubt that it provides a compact and clearly defined territory with a motorway to the south. However, on balance it is our view that it would be an undersized metropolitan district of 220,000. The relationship of Sutton Coldfield to Birmingham, and particularly the area that would have to be added to Sutton Coldfield, is greater than the relationship of the two areas which it is proposed to link. Certainly, the pattern of work would indicate that this is the case; the work flow figures are substantially on the side of that argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, whilst I must say that we have no indication of the views of the people whom it is proposed to detach from the City of Birmingham and add to Sutton Coldfield, we feel on balance that the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0419">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>767</span>
argument is in favour of the proposals as published in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 468 and 469 deal simply with the argument of moving Bickenhill back into the city and adding various parishes to Solihull in order to make it a wider connection to the north. Broadly speaking, I think I have dealt with the arguments in answering the right hon. Member for Small Heath because they centre around the need for moving Bickenhill, with its airport and exhibition site, into the city. I hope my answers will have been accepted by hon. Members opposite as helpful. They were certainly intended to be. From Birmingham's point of view, the need for this particular change is in no way as substantial as we might have thought before this debate took place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 229 and 238 deal with the big issue of the readjustment of returning to Birmingham the parishes of Meriden rural district, which were originally proposed to be included with the city when the White Paper was published. In answer to the specific question, "What happened?" I have explained why it is that we do not feel that those arguments overweigh the wishes of the local people which were overwhelmingly in favour of the sort of proposals that we have put forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in the letter of 10th January which the right hon. Member for Small Heath quoted, and I must say that it is in conflict with the representations that were made to me when I held my meeting in Birmingham. At that time, the representatives of the parishes who came to see me, including Kingshurst and Chelmsley Wood, were overwhelmingly in favour of staying out of Birmingham, and if they have changed their minds—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated assent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not know that and I have asked for that to be investigated. I certainly did not know it this morning. It represents a late change of heart and, having listened to what they said when I went up there last summer and came to an agreement along the lines they indicated, it makes it difficult for a Minister to find that they want to change the situation back again. I presume that would mean that one would have to go and consult all the other parishes who, presumably, do not
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>768</span>
want to change the situation back again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a difficulty. Certainly, what they asked for when I was up there is what has been embodied in the proposals, and I think it would now be very difficult to go back.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the Minister's difficulty on this point, but, of course, it is very often the case that wiser counsels come later in the day with rather more mature consideration. I have had the advantage of discussing this with certain members of the council of Kingshurst who are concerned about the political implications, which it might be wrong to talk about here today—not only the future local government representation but the future parliamentary representation of those authorities. That is a matter which causes great concern to many of them, as well as the fundamental question of housing and education to which they attach a lot of importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry the Minister has not received the letter yet, although it is odd that I have had the letter which was dispatched on 10th January, and he has not. I should not say that I am more efficient than his officials; it is probably one of the results of a monolithic Department such as that in which he now serves. No doubt, he will look into this in due course and let us have a further word about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly look into it, although I should say that if the arguments are to do with the political representation, perhaps it is not so surprising that he had the letter before I did. I am not sure that that would be an argument that I should find it possible to follow with any great enthusiasm. I certainly have no idea what the effect of the political representation at the parliamentary level will be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had better make it clear that my letter came from the political representatives on the local authority who told me that the local authority had decided on the policy that day, and the clerk had been instructed to write to the Minister. I assumed that the Clerk had done that. I think that it would be wrong to assume anything otherwise. Nevertheless, there is nothing much in this point; it is an administrative slip-up somewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It begins to become clear how there might have been a difference
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0420">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>769</span>
in speed between the two notification processes. I shall look into it, but I do not think that it will in any way invalidate the point that I am making that the overwhelming majority of the parishes in that area represented that they wished to be knocked out of Birmingham and wanted, if possible, to be in Warwickshire, and, if not in Warwickshire, in part of the Solihull district. One may have changed one's mind, but I am not aware of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that will explain to the Committee why, having heard the arguments on the ground, we felt that the present proposals made more sense and were more acceptable to the people concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that this has been a long debate and a very interesting one. I hope that I have been able to indicate that some of the problems raised are not of the same substance as they perhaps appeared at the beginning of the debate. We shall have to resist the Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be able to speak much more briefly than I would otherwise have done, in view of what the Minister has said, and I am grateful to him for speaking further because I can expedite the Committee's business as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I begin, however, with a complaint? I am sorry to raise this again, but I think it important when we are discussing Amendments of this gravity that we should be able to see maps. I see that the Minister has a copy of the Ordnance Survey map for this area, but on this side of the Committee we have no map. The Ordnance Survey maps were not available when I asked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be that I took the last one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been handed a map, but it is of the area of west Birmingham, and these Amendments concern the area east of Birmingham. I think it is important that maps should be distributed, because it will be difficult for other members of the Committee who do not have the personal knowledge of the West Midlands that perhaps the Minister now has, and which hon. Gentlemen who have already spoken have had for some time, if they cannot see on a map the importance of these Amendments and why we are moving them. Could we have these maps passed round? I see that the hon. Member for Meriden (Mr. Speed) has one, but we
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>770</span>
do not have them on this side of the Committee at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Speed</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I picked these maps up at 10.30 a.m. In respect of Chelmsley Wood the maps will not be very helpful to the Committee, because the Chelmsley Wood development is so vast and so recent that no map yet published shows it, as far as I am aware.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Meriden, because he has mentioned my next point. It would help if members of the Committee could see how close these parishes are to Birmingham, and could see the road pattern of the area, which is very significant and important. A major road runs from Coventry to Birmingham, known locally as the Coventry road. It runs past the airport, which is called Birmingham Airport, and goes into the city of Birmingham. It is a major transport route which divides the parishes with which some of these Amendments are concerned. It would have helped if the Committee could see that point for itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also draw attention to the pattern of road communication south of Solihull, because it is important to Amendment No. 238, which would include Hockley Heath and Tanworth-in-Arden in the Solihull district. I hope that maps will be available for hon. Members on both sides of the Committee this afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the general point of view put forward by the hon. Member for Meriden, but I disagree with him on the particular point of these Amendments. I can speak only for myself, but I am satisfied that a case has been made out for the inclusion in Birmingham of these parishes, which I shall call, generically, Chelmsley Wood. That is how the development is known in the area. The hon. Member for Meriden has already mentioned my concern about the green belt, and about peripheral development by the City of Birmingham. He knows that I agree with him on much of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looking at the point dispassionately, I think that a good case has been made out. I agree that there is a case against. The advocates on both sides have tended to suggest that all the arguments were on their side of the case. That is not true. A strong case can be made out on either side of the argument, but it is my opinion that, on balance, there is a case for the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0421">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>771</span>
Amendments, and that the Chelmsley Wood area should be included in the City of Birmingham. That is why I have put my name to some of the Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that there is a financial burden for the City of Birmingham in the development of the National Exhibition Centre. I agree that the airport is a financial burden on the City. I think that the hon. Gentleman agrees with me. It is right, therefore, that these facilities should be included in the boundaries of the City of Birmingham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think, also, that people who live in the Chelmsley Wood area still feel themselves to be Birmingham people. The development of Chelmsley Wood has now reached such a stage that the Chelmsley Wood development dominates the previously rural character of that area. I should be interested to know what attempts have been made to assess the feeling of the people who live in the Chelmsley Wood development. I accept everything that the hon. Gentleman has said about the views of the parish councils. My right hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) has explained to us that at least one parish council has changed its view quite recently. I wish that the Government had made some attempt to assess the feeling of people who are not councillors, whether of a parish council, a rural district council, or the county council of Warwickshire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Speed</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did say that there had been a poll. There have been a number of polls, but one poll conducted by an independent county council of the ordinary people showed substantially that people preferred the Solihull rather than the Birmingham argument. I have had meet-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>772</span>
ings there myself, and have had a large number of letters. I have regular advice bureaux twice a month in the area, and I have no doubt, from all the representations from ordinary people—as opposed to councillors—that there is a clear majority for the Solihull argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful to the hon. Member for Meriden for giving us that information. It is important. The hon. Member did not give the figures. I hope that during the afternoon he will be able to make some figures available, because I should like to see the results of that independent poll, which would weigh most heavily with me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said several times on other Amendments. I approach the whole question of local government organisation on the basis of what people want rather than what the Government in London or, indeed, the local governors themselves, believe the people want, or think that they should want or should have. I should like to know from the Minister whether he has actually visited the areas that we are discussing; whether he has been to Chelmsley Wood. I appreciate that he went to the City of Birmingham and met representatives there—as he met representatives of other parts of the West Midlands who feel strongly about the Government's proposals—but I should like to know whether he saw the area for himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He told us that he had visited, by helicopter, places in the North. I would hope that he flew over the Chelmsley Wood development.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
