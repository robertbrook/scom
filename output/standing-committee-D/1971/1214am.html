</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denis Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Seeing before me the Minister, with whom I was discussing rate support grant last night at a very late hour, I am tempted to open this morning by saying to him: "At the going down of the sun and in the morning we will remember
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 368</span>
him" We shall certainly remember him for his efforts to put on the Statute Book such a monumental Measure as this which we on this side of the Committee consider to be too hasty. We are as anxious as the Minister to make progress and we do not want unduly to prolong the debate on the Amendment; but I should like to state that there is a great deal of misgiving in many parts of the country, and certainly on these benches, about the sheer practicality, even if the Bill becomes law in anything like its present form, of getting all the administrative changes implemented in our local authorities in the time scale which it sets down.<br><br>
The Amendment is a modest attempt to give local authorities one year's breathing space to implement the enormous amount of administrative work. Indeed, one might say that they will be suffering from administrative indigestion if town clerks and treasurers attempt to implement, over such a wide range, the problems which the Bill will provide for them.<br><br>
The first problem is that of staffing. The question of the future of the staff, we all agree is of great importance—the transfer of staff from one authority to another. The appointment of chief officers and other officers is something which many of us, who have sat on local authorities, know takes a very long time. Perhaps this, of all the matters which local councillors deal with, causes the most difficulty. It would be almost impossible to deal with that situation in the time scale unless, as my hon. Friend the Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) said at the last Sitting, there is a great deal of work done in anticipation of the Bill receiving the Royal Assent. This raises the question whether in some parts the Bill is <i>ultra vires.</i><br><br>
There is the question of local government finance. I mentioned staffing only to illustrate the size of the problem. The Government are seeking to set the dates for the future of local government before we have any real knowledge of what the Government intend to do in respect of the future of local government finance, what the financing arrangements will be within the various authorities, how far there will be precepting arrangements, and how far authorities may levy their own rates. These are questions of cardinal importance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is also the question of differential rating and differential precepts at the end of the Bill.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0208">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 369</span>
about which we have heard nothing. These will cause concern in the minds of local authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I am sure the Committee will appreciate that on staffing and finance alone one could speak for a long time. I am trying to help the Committee to reach a conclusion by merely mentioning the problems. I think the Minister ought to tell us the thinking of the Government.<br><br>
I know, in respect of local government finance, that we have a Green Paper, but Green Papers are Green Papers. I have had experience in this Ministry in the past, and I know perfectly well that what comes out at the end of the sausage machine is nothing like what one puts in at the beginning. Although a Green Paper is a contribution for thought, which I think it is intended to be, it cannot be taken as definite statement of Government policy.<br><br>
There is the question of borough status and districts. This is something which has to be resolved. There is the question of the retirement of councillors, and how that should be determined, which is dealt with in Clause 7.<br><br>
Clause 17 deals with the future of parish councillors and neighbourhood councils. We spent a long time discussing this problem, but in the end the Under-Secretary said that the Government will think again, for which we were grateful, and that they will announce their conclusions on Report. Therefore, we shall not know the Government's conclusions on that until well into next year and we are expecting these councils to be established by 1973. This is almost an administrative impossibility.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Mr. Blenkinsop) raised the interesting question of the national parks. There are many people interested in the countryside, and people are writing to us drawing our attention to what they regard as the most unsatisfactory feature of these proposals in respect of national parks, especially in Clauses 177 and 178. I should have thought that an extra year, in respect of the determination of policy there, would be something to be welcomed. It would enable the people responsible for national parks to be adequately consulted. It is clear from the correspondence we have been receiving that they do not at the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 370</span>
moment consider that they have been adequately consulted.<br><br>
I want to raise one final matter. I am glad to see that the Minister of State, Home Office, is here. We shall at some time be discussing the Clauses which deal with electoral machinery for which, presumably, the Minister of State is responsible. I am informed that there is a tremendous mess in the Bill as far as proposals for elections are concerned. As I understand the point, to put it very briefly, the dates for the commencement of work of the Local Government Boundary Commission make a nonsense of the dates at which the Parliamentary Boundary Commission has to operate. The two things go side by side. The Parliamentary Boundary Commission has to do its work on the basis of local government boundaries. Therefore, it must follow <i>ipso facto</i> that the local government boundaries have to be established before the Parliamentary boundaries can be established. As I understand the proposals in the Bill, the Parliamentary Boundary Commission will be one year ahead of the Local Government Boundary Commission in doing their review work, which would make a nonsense of all our efforts.<br><br>
My party's advisers tell me that they have taken this matter up with the Home Department, but without satisfactory answers so far. I think it is conceded that there is a serious problem here, and at this point it is sufficient to this argument to say that if there is this confusion operating between the Home Department and representatives of one of the two major political parties, it is clear that the time scale that we are now discussing ought to be amended by a further year in order that the question of the coordination of the two Boundary Commissions can be adequately determined.<br><br>
I have said enough, I hope, to enable the Under-Secretary to reply so that we can dispose of this Amendment. I do not use the term "dispose" in any derogatory sense. It is our case that the Government are imposing upon local authorities an impossible timetable for the implementation of this Bill, even if the Bill is passed in anything like its present form. Given even the advance consultations which local authorities are having with each other, and which local government members across the parties are having among themselves in anticipation of this Bill—given even all that amount of good will, the time scale necessary for the staffing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0209">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 371</span>
and the financing arrangements to be adequately made and not to be imposed upon the electorate in undue haste, seems to be a compelling reason why this Amendment should be carried.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Michael Heseltine)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the essence of the situation is summed up in the remarks with which the hon. Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) concluded his speech.<br><br>
The fact of the matter is that there have been lengthy, protracted and widespread discussions and consultations on local government reform, both in detail and in principle, over a number of years. If I had to conclude what was the single and most dominant recurring message that I have had from going round the country talking on this issue to people both on the professional and elected side of local government, it would be that whatever the Government do, we should make up our minds quickly and get it done. This has been said to me time and again, even by those who are not as convinced as I am that our set of proposals is the right one, because the uncertainty that has hung over local government for too long is seen as damaging to the concept of local government.<br><br>
I therefore say to hon. Members opposite who have put forward these Amendments, that although they are probably justified in probing with the Amendments, they are not justified in considering that they should push them further than that. I believe that it has been made abundantly clear that the best interests of local government will now be served by progress with the implementation of this legislation. I should like to quote in aid the right hon. Member for Grimsby (Mr. Crosland), who, in the debates on the White Paper on 19th May, made it clear in his view that there is no doubt at all that we need radical reform of local government. He went on to say that it is not in question that the matter is now urgent. I think this is the message for this Committee on this set of Amendments.<br><br>
I turn to some of the specific points that have been raised. The argument of the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) in moving the Amendment, that there is now need for a breathing space, leads directly out of what I have been saying. I say with confidence that the one thing
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 372</span>
for which there is not a need at this moment is a breathing space. There is urgent need for the various ideas and proposals, particularly those of this legislation, to be brought into effect as early as is possible within the framework of parliamentary procedures.<br><br>
I am aware—as everyone who has sat on Committees is aware—that in debates such as we are having, if the Government go for speed the Opposition suggest the matter should be delayed; if the Government go for delay, the Opposition want to speed it up. This is a perfectly legitimate subject for ventilation, but not one, I suggest, that should hold up this Committee for any considerable time.<br><br>
Both the hon. Member for Widnes and the hon. Member for Birmingham, Small Heath raised the point about the constitutional propriety of the establishment of a Boundary Commission on an informal basis before the Bill has received Royal Assent. Again, this is an issue which all who have served on parliamentary committees know is raised on legislation of this sort.<br><br>
I remember, only two years ago, sitting on the benches opposite in this Committee room, probing the then Government of the day for setting up the National Ports Authority on an advisory basis when they were at that time legislating to nationalise the ports. We managed to see off that particular proposal, but all the time when the Standing Committee was examining whether we should, in fact, set up such an Authority, the members of the Authority had already been named, and were travelling the country offering jobs to people on the new set-up that would be brought into effect if the Bill reached law.<br><br>
The practice is totally accepted, therefore, in parliamentary terms, that in order to end uncertainty if Parliament decides to put the legislation through, there should be this shadow framework in existence whilst the legislation is being considered. This has been done by all Governments and I am sure that hon. Members opposite, on reflection, will not want to make too much of that point.<br><br>
The next point raised by the hon. Member for Widnes was that of the dilemma facing the staff and officers of the various local authorities. To me this is the most crucial argument of all. It is the argument that weighed most heavily with me in reading the first papers as to the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0210">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 373</span>
timing of this exercise. The hon. Member's submission was that the officers are in a muddle. I made a careful note of the hon. Member's remarks and I think I have summarised them correctly. But does he believe that this period of muddle will be brought to an end more effectively by delaying the exercise for another year? I suggest that the reverse would be the case, because now they know—and I pay tribute to the self-sacrifice being made by local government officers whilst the uncertainty exists—that the uncertainty can be brought to a conclusion after the election of the shadow councils in 1973.<br><br>
If we were to accept these Amendments, they would know that their careers would be put "in hock" for another 12 months before decisions can be taken. I do not believe that that would be anything but harmful to the career prospects and personal anxieties of the very large number of staff which is bound to be involved in this exercise. I believe that that argument is prayed in aid in exactly the opposite way in which it should be prayed in aid.<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Birmingham, Small Heath, repeated what had been put forward about the various other difficulties which we shall be considering—the question of property transfers, the electoral arrangements, the rating situation. All these are matters which we shall be looking at as we proceed with our deliberations on this Committee.<br><br>
I say to hon. Members opposite that it is more important that we should make progress on this Bill so that we have an adequate opportunity to examine these matters in detail—which, with respect, hon. Members opposite seem reluctant to do—so that there is plenty of time for a cool and probing examination. [<i>Interruption.</i>] We have not yet reached the end of Clause and we have had eight Sittings—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Under-Secretary of State will take, let us say, 25 minutes instead of 45 minutes, we would proceed very well. I should point out that in the last series of Amendments, both he and a large number of his hon. Friends, who had Amendments down, thought it was worth while speaking to those Amendments. I believe they spoke for longer
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 374</span>
than we did on this side of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think the right hon. Member will appreciate that if it is a question of swapping column inches or time spoken, we on this side of the Committee have won this Bill already. I do not think we want to become involved in the minutiae of one particular and important debate. The fact is, that on a very large Bill and after eight Sittings, we have not yet reached the end of Clause 1. This indicates clearly that hon. Members opposite have not yet taken on board the great deal of detailed examination that this Bill will require as we reach later stages. I should have thought that we would be serving local government better if we were to make progress into the detail of the Bill rather than dealing with wide-ranging delaying tactics of the sort that we—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ernest Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why do not you rig the Committees as well as the Questions?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I may say so, I am sure the hon. Member has a great deal of experience in that sort of situation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I could certainly teach the hon. Gentleman a few things.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad the hon. Member admits that he could teach me a few things. In that context, I would be willing to learn.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Committee will make better progress without sedentary comments and replies. I have previously mentioned to the Under-Secretary the desirability of ignoring interruptions made from a sitting position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That I should wish to deal with every point that is raised shows what an immensely reasonable man I am. However, I will accept your guidance, Sir Stephen.<br><br>
I have attempted to summarise the essence of the argument, concentrating on the argument relating to staff. I believe that, for the benefit of those people whose careers are centred in local authority work, it is necessary that we get this legislation on to the Statute Book and the resulting elections under way and behind us. Thus the career situation of those people can be streamlined and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0211">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 375</span>
rationalised, so that the way forward may be clear in the exciting task which lies ahead of them.<br><br>
A further 12-months delay would not solve any of the problems raised by hon. Gentlemen opposite, since their proposals do not affect the time scale of the exercise; they are still allowing only a year between election and the coming into power of the new authorities. I believe that this proposal would have a most regrettable effect upon the morale of local authorities, whether at elected or official level, and I ask hon. Members opposite not to press the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary spoke of "delaying tactics". I think that that was a very foolish expression for him to have used. My hon. Friends and I, if we so wished, could certainly employ delaying tactics, the Amendment under discussion being a case in point. For example, in this context, we could examine every Clause and Schedule of the Bill, studying the implications of 1974 and 1975 in relation to each Clause. Again, it was pointed out to my hon. Friend the Member for The Hartlepools (Mr. Leadbitter) that he was quoting rather extensively from the White Paper. He said that he had quoted part of paragraph 62, that there were 65 paragraphs in all, and that he proposed to quote one more. I had rather thought he was going to say he proposed to quote from the other 64. In other words, if my hon. Friends and I wished to delay the Bill, there are many means by which we could do so.<br><br>
However, we do not propose to delay the Bill. We propose to engage in the right and proper task of any Opposition to examine not only the detailed proposals of the Bill but the concepts behind it, which are contained mainly in Clause 1. Hence it is inevitable that there should be lengthy discussion of Clause 1 before we even reach the detailed proposals.<br><br>
Turning to the question of staff, under the terms of the Bill it will be the staff commission which will determine the conditions of service and of transfer between one authority and another, as well as redundancies and the placement of officers. That commission is not yet set up. My purpose in delaying the matter for 12 months was in order that that body would then be in existence and would be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 376</span>
reporting to the officers, so that they would know what was to happen to them in the future.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary did not reply to my point concerning Part X of the Bill concerning the present dilemma existing between the magistrates' clerks, taking into account the Lord Chancellor's proposals on the one hand and the proposals of the Bill on the other hand. With reference to his remarks concerning the Secretary of State's action in setting up this commission, if we, when in power, did what the previous Government did, it is just as wrong as hon. Gentlemen opposite in doing so. I agree with the hon. Member for Brierley Hill (Mr. Montgomery) who, when the Under-Secretary referred to the Ports Bill and to the Committee being set up, said "Quite disgraceful". It is quite disgraceful for any Minister to pre-empt the decision of the House and set up a committee, under whichever Administration the procedure is brought into operation.<br><br>
There are a number of other important points which could be dealt with under the Amendment. However, as a token of my good faith that my hon. Friends and I are anxious to progress with the Bill, I bet to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p>Amendments made:</p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fitch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Had my hon. Friend the Member for Westhoughton (Mr. J. T. Price) been fortunate enough to be a member of this Committee he would have been moving this Amendment himself because it concerns the district of Westhoughton, which is one of the major parts of his constituency. The inhabitants of Westhoughton would like to go into <i>District</i> (<i>a</i>), which is the Wigan-Leigh district, and as I represent Wigan and live in Leigh, I have an interest in the Amendment.<br><br>
I shall deploy some arguments as to why the urban district of Westhoughton would be better served in <i>District</i> (<i>a</i>)—the Wigan-Leigh district—than in <i>District</i> (<i>b</i>), which is the Bolton district. The other district has an area of 5,560 acres and the Registrar General's mid-1970 estimate of population is 17,360.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0213">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 379</span>
The disposition of the district under the Bill is important. The area of the district is something of a plum in South Lancashire in that it is generally regarded as a very good development area which is ripe for large development. By existing local government standards, it is a comparatively large district in area. There are, in fact, 12 urban districts only in Lancashire—out of 65—with an area larger than Westhoughton, and six of those 12 areas embrace either large tracts of upland or other land unlikely to be built upon for reasons of nature conservation.<br><br>
The district unfortunately has been bred on coal, textiles and agriculture. Coal has contributed and textiles are not so significant, but there has been some other industrial developments. In 1950-51 there were proposals to develop the district by building to meet Salford's housing difficulties, but by 1957 Salford changed its mind. Subsequent to 1957 there were proposals for large-scale development to meet the Manchester difficulties, as an alternative to Manchester development in Cheshire, but in 1966 the Manchester scheme was finally abandoned by the then Minister saying that as there was not sufficient prospect of making progress with a town development scheme, he had withdrawn his support from the scheme. This shows that Westhoughton has been looked upon by surrounding large areas such as Manchester and Salford as a suitable place for their large-scale developments. For the purpose of the development plan for the Manchester proposals, it was estimated that 2,700 acres of agricultural land would be used for development, and Westhoughton is still regarded as a major regional growth area of considerable importance.<br><br>
Following the Minister's abandonment of the Manchester development in 1966, a decision was taken by the county and district councils, acting together, to provide a framework for growth to a population of 40,000 by 1991. For such purposes the Westhoughton district council is now putting down, with the Minister's approval, sewage disposal works at a cost approaching £1 million and has departmental provisional approval for proposals for sewers, the cost of which is estimated to be £2 million, of which about £1 million worth will be commenced in the immediate future, subject to consent. It will be seen
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 380</span>
that Westhoughton is proceeding with schemes to improve its amenities.<br><br>
At the joint instance of county and district there is at long last the prospect of the district meeting the purpose offered by its acres ripe for development. If it were not for the changes proposed by the Bill, the district could get under way in terms of development and improvement. The suggestion now made is that in the Greater Manchester <i>District</i> (<i>a</i>), the area now comprising Westhoughton, may have more likelihood of a satisfactory future than it has in area (<i>b</i>). Experience suggests that the existing district might more readily find its future in the new district. There has been a long-standing feeling among the inhabitants of Westhoughton that in this respect, and in others, their future is better safeguarded if they are in <i>District</i> (<i>a</i>).<br><br>
Westhoughton Council, with Aspull and Hindley, two of its neighbours, are likely to join <i>District</i> (<i>a</i>), comprising some 70 acres on the common boundary, the condition of which has been considerably improved by joint efforts over the past 35 years. If the districts are separated the future of the woodland must be decided. Westhoughton members serve on the divisional education committee executive setup under the Education Act 1944, with members from three of the urban districts that are to join the new <i>District</i> (<i>a</i>); that is to say the urban districts of Ince-in-Makerfield, Hindley and Abram.<br><br>
Westhoughton gives its name to a Parliamentary constituency and the area of the new <i>District</i> (<i>a</i>) that takes in the larger part of the Parliamentary constituency, namely the urban districts of Aspull, Hindley, Standish-with-Langtree and that part of the rural district of Wigan which, under the Bill, comes under area (<i>a</i>).<br><br>
The Westhoughton Council in its representations has reminded the Secretary of State that the Local Government Commission in its draft proposals of December, 1965, suggested that Westhoughton's links with Bolton were not then demonstrably strong. Local circumstances have not altered since. Westhoughton also made the point in its representations that, taking the population criteria of 250,000 for the new districts in the metropolitan counties, 11 of the proposed metropolitan districts out of 34 defined in circular 8/71 had populations of less than 250,000. I could deploy more arguments but I feel that what I have said should demonstrate to the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0214">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 381</span>
Government that the interests of Westhoughton would be better served by its inclusion in <i>District</i> (<i>a</i>) than in <i>District</i> (<i>b</i>).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Laurance Reed</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish, in opposing the Amendment on behalf of the people of Bolton and Over Hulton, to put five points to the Committee. First, Westhoughton has a seven-mile common bundary with the existing Borough of Bolton, and nothing with the Wigan County Borough. Second, Westhoughton is part of the Bolton travel-to-work area as defined and used for statistical purposes by the Department of Employment.<br><br>
Third, there is a much stronger connection through work with Bolton than there is with Wigan. I understand that nearly 3,000 people from Westhoughton work in Bolton, Farnworth and Horwich, which will form part of the new <i>District</i> (<i>b</i>), whereas only 900 people from Westhoughton go to work in Wigan, Leigh, Atherton and Hindley, which are to form part of the new <i>District</i> (<i>a</i>).<br><br>
Fourth, Westhoughton enjoys the same Wakes Week as Bolton, something it does not share in common with Wigan. This is an historical representation of the very close trade connection over the years between Bolton and Westhoughton. Fifth, the Chamber of Commerce and the Trades Council of Bolton and District include Westhoughton. The same can be said for a large number of professional, cultural, social and sporting organisations in Bolton.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Bolton, East (Mr. Laurance Reed) has covered the points that I would have made on that particular Amendment. I will, however, speak to a number of other Amendments on the Order Paper which are in my name.<br><br>
I begin with a tribute to the Department for having provided us with an excellent series of maps of the area. There is the general map, covering Merseyside and Greater Manchester, to which I shall be referring in more detail, and a further useful map showing the divisions of two of the urban districts, Turton and Ramsbottom, by ward—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Cocks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for interrupting my hon. Friend but I must take him to task over his rather fulsome praise of the maps furnished by the Department. Would he not agree with the point made by the hon. Member for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 382</span>
Bolton, East (Mr. Laurance Reed) that contour maps, on which we could see the relief features, would have been an additional advantage, and would he not urge the Minister to provide them in every case?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has gone further in my argument. I was about to make that point on the question of relief, which will apply when we come to the Amendment dealing with the Turton Urban District Council, to which both I and the Member for Bolton, East have put our names. As the Committee will realise, matters of relief will play an important part in the argument. Before I complete what my hon. Friend has referred to as fulsome praise—which will be less fulsome as I continue—I want to refer to the map which the Department has deposited in the Library, showing the detailed boundary of the Egerton ward of the Turton Urban District Council, which is the only ward in any urban district which has been divided by the Schedule.<br><br>
The Amendments to which I wish to speak fall into various groups. One set of Amendments sets back the boundaries proposed in the Schedule to the Bill to the boundaries proposed in Circular 8/71 issued by the Department of the Environment in February of this year. Looking at the map of Merseyside and Greater Manchester, and working clockwise from Wigan, Amendment No. 255 will bring into <i>District</i> (<i>a</i>) three parishes in the Wigan Rural District Council, Wrightington, Parbold and Dalton, which form the north-western corner of the Wigan Rural District.<br><br>
A group of three Amendments—Nos. 130, 131 and 132—brings the northern part of the Turton District, that is Belmont, Chapeltown, Edgworth and part of the Egerton ward of Turton, into <i>District</i> (<i>b</i>). Amendments Nos. 133 and 134 bring the north ward and the Walmersley cum Shuttleworth ward of Ramsbottom back into Ramsbottom. Amendments Nos. 137 and 138 take Glossop, Charlesworth and Chisworth from Derbyshire into <i>District</i> (<i>f</i>), and Tintwistle as well.<br><br>
A further group of Amendments, Nos. 135, 136 and 256, bring the urban district of Alderley Edge, the rural district of Disley and the urban districts of New Mills and Whaley Bridge into the Stockport district, <i>District</i> (<i>h</i>), at the far south-east
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0215">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 383</span>
of the conurbation. There is a final group of Amendments to which I wish to speak, designed to bring two wards of the Golborne Urban District Council, which have been excluded from Golborne, back into Greater Manchester. Those Amendments, Nos. 225 and 227, refer to the Culcheth and Newchurch wards of the Golborne Urban District Council.<br><br>
Most of the Amendments are designed to extend the outer boundary of Greater Manchester back to that proposed in the Department's own proposals of February of this year. The group of Amendments does not have the effect of widening the boundaries as wide as they were drawn by Redcliffe-Maud, and such towns as Macclesfield, Knutsford, Northwich and Winsford which were included in Greater Manchester in that Report have not been drawn in, because to do so would cripple any prospect of maintaining an independent Cheshire County Council.<br><br>
We may have differences of opinion as to whether or not it was a good idea for the Department to attempt to maintain a separate Cheshire County Council, but the Amendments do not attempt to seriously reduce the populations of the new Cheshire and Lancashire County Councils which will be formed if the Bill becomes law.<br><br>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
The effects of all the Amendments I have detailed will result in a loss of population of not more than 15,000 persons to each of those counties, or a reduction of about 1 per cent. in the population of Lancashire, and somewhat less than 2 per cent. in Cheshire. On population grounds neither loss can be considered serious.<br><br>
It is true that the Amendments would mean the inclusion of 40,000 people from Derbyshire in Greater Manchester. That is a more substantial change. I am only sorry that my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Swain) is unable to be with us today, as I am sure that he would wish to defend the rights of the Derbyshire boundaries.<br><br>
But even if we were to remove Glossop, Charlesworth, Chisworth, Whaley Bridge and New Mills from Derbyshire, it would mean a reduction of only 5 per cent. in the population of the proposed county of Derbyshire.<br><br>
Before I come to the detail of each of these Amendments, there are certain general points which I will make about the group of Amendments as a whole. I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 384</span>
should be interested to hear from the Minister in due course what were the reasons which led his Department to exclude these areas from Greater Manchester. I know that he has held a series of consultations. The Under-Secretary, feeling perhaps that his earlier view from a helicopter was inadequate, visited one of the areas covered by this group of Amendments only last week to view personally whether the boundary had been drawn in the right place.<br><br>
I realise that in some cases there have been representations from the local authorities concerned. The Under-Secretary is looking confused. I understand that he visited Ramsbottom last week The <i>Ramsbottom Press</i> quoted him as having visited there.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that we have been under some pressure, but to the best of my knowledge I was not there. I was in Bury. That is where I think the confusion has arisen. I have also been to Stockport.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When I reach the appropriate Amendment dealing with Ramsbottom I shall quote the Minister, as reported in the <i>Bury Times</i> this week, about his visit to Ramsbottom and his determination of this as the appropriate boundary. I shall keep him waiting until then, before taking him out of his misery, and perhaps between now and then he will check his diary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have just had an authoritative check made. I was not in Ramsbottom.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps in that case I may take the Minister out of his misery at this point. In an article in the <i>Bury Times</i> of Friday, 10th December, the Minister is quoted discussing various things, including the Bury and Rochdale Amendment, which will no doubt be discussed by my hon. Friend the Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes). Regarding Ramsbottom, the Minister is reported as having stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"There are difficulties in that area and I am sure they will be raised in Committee"—</p></blockquote>
as indeed they will. The report continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"I am very impressed by the argument about the community of Rossendale feeling, and having driven around the area, my impression was greatly heightened.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>But I could not avoid noticing that there was a relationship between parts of the people living in Ramsbottom and the conurbation itself. The conclusion seemed right that we draw a line separating those members of the Ramsbottom
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0216">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 385</span>
community a pearing to be an inherent part of the conurbation from those with a closer community relationship with the Rossendale Valley."</p></blockquote>
I do not know whether the Minister when he made those remarks in Bury had heard the remarks of the Chairman of the Ramsbottom Urban District Council addressing a public meeting of 200 people in Ramsbottom the previous day. The Chairman, describing these proposals after the Minister had pointed out that he had drawn a line on the map, said:
<br><blockquote><p>"A man in Whitehall had to draw a line and he drew it along the daftest line he could have picked."</p></blockquote>
Perhaps when the Minister comes to reply he will clarify his movements in the Ramsbottom area and the place where he had drawn this curious line on the map.<br><br>
Returning to the general argument, I realise that the Department has been under some pressure from local authorities. There have been representations, in almost all cases by the district and borough councils concerned in this group of Amendments. There has been a representation from the Derbyshire County Council for Glossop, Charlesworth, Chisworth, New Mills and Whaley Bridge to be retained in Derbyshire. There has been one from the Cheshire County Council for Alderley Edge to come into the new Cheshire County.<br><br>
But rather significantly, as far as I know there was no representation from the Cheshire County Council to ask for Disley to be included in the new Cheshire County. When I come to discuss the geographical location of Disley, the Committee will see why Cheshire County Council was not foolish enough to suggest such a transfer.<br><br>
I suspect that in many cases, councils have reacted on grounds which are a combination of traditionalism, snobbery and somewhat irrational fears. There is a view that it is somehow superior to live in the county rather than be swallowed up in the great maw of Greater Manchester. In these areas there is often little understanding of the wide range of powers that will be dealt with at the metropolitan district level and that Bolton, Ashton and Stockport are much closer to hand than Preston, Chester and Matlock.<br><br>
There is a fear in these areas that great tracts of overspill housing will suddenly appear in what are euphemistically described as "residential areas". Incidentally,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 386</span>
I have always wondered why only the middle classes "reside", while other people have to be "housed". In any case, many of these areas consider themselves to be residential areas, and therefore, do not want anybody else to live there. I think the Minister will agree that this fear of local authority housing development on any scale is misplaced in the case of the areas covered by almost all of these Amendments, as either difficult topography or other constraints makes building very difficult, if not impossible. I suspect that the new towns programme for the North-West will provide more than adequately for the housing needs of Greater Manchester for the foreseeable future.<br><br>
All the areas covered by these Amendments, except the parishes in the Wigan Rural District, Whaley Bridge and New Mills area, were included in the area covered by the S.E.L.N.E.C. Passenger Transport Authority—S.E.L.N.E.C. being formed from South East Lancashire and North-East Cheshire, the previous name for this conurbation—which was set up by the Minister of Transport in 1969. The then Minister took the view that the areas of Turton, Ramsbottom, Tintwistle, Glossop, Disley and Alderley Edge, which it is now proposed to exclude from the conurbation, should necessarily be included in the conurbation for transport purposes.<br><br>
At that time, when the boundaries of the Passenger Transport Authority were being defined, the Minister took the view that the areas for the Passenger Transport Authority should be restricted to a minimum, having regard to the community of interest and the urgent planning and transportation problems. It was envisaged at that time that the area could always be extended if the local boundaries, ultimately agreed for the conurbations, should be wider than those defined for the Passenger Transport Authority.<br><br>
But we now find that, instead of widening the boundaries beyond those of the Passenger Transport Authority, the Secretary of State, notwithstanding the common planning and transportation problems of these areas, is planning to exclude -them from the conurbations. I will return to the transport problems later when I come to deal with the individual Amendments.<br><br>
It is worth noting at this stage that from
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0217">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 387</span>
the excluded areas of Turton, from parts of Ramsbottom, from Tintwistle, and from Disley, the passenger links are all into the metropolitan district from which these areas have been excluded, rather than into the counties into which they have been included in the Bill. For example, the only way to get from parts of Turton urban district to the county district into which it has been included will be to come into the Greater Manchester county area and then change buses.<br><br>
I will now deal with the specific Amendments one by one. Amendment No. 255 deals with the three parishes of Wrightington, Parbold and Dalton, which have been chopped off from the rest of the Wigan rural district. Quite clearly, they are the far extremity of Greater Manchester by any definition, but they are linked economically with Wigan rather than with the country to the north. The train service from Manchester and Bolton through Wigan to Southport goes through Parbold and brings people to work in Wigan, Bolton and Manchester itself. It might be that subsequently, with the development of the central Lancashire new town to the north, this area should be reconsidered.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will look again at these three parishes. I also hope that he will give the reasons why he proposes to add to the problems of local government reorganisation by dividing the rural district. Unless there is a very good argument for doing this, it would be far better not to do so because there are sufficient other problems as a result of reorganisation. These detailed changes of breaking up a rural district or an urban district could lead to subsequent abuse by the Boundary Commission. I hope that in this case the Minister can show that he has good reasons for the exclusion of those particular parishes.<br><br>
The purpose of Amendments Nos. 130, 131 and 132 is to bring the Belmont, Chapeltown and Edgeworth wards, and part of the Egerton Ward, into the Bolton metropolitan district. I must declare my interest here in that I live in the Chapeltown ward and will, therefore, be affected by the change of boundary.<br><br>
The Turton Urban District Council wanted the whole of its area to be excluded from the Bolton Metropolitan District, while the other authorities felt that it was right for the whole of the area to be included. Thus, the Minister appears to have carried out a Judgment
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 388</span>
of Solomon by dividing the Turton Urban District Council in two. He was unable, quite rightly, to agree to the Turton Urban District Council's proposal to take the whole of Turton out of the Greater Manchester <i>District</i> (<i>b</i>), since the Urban District comprises suburban fringes of Bolton which clearly belong with Bolton. However, as a sop to a certain sector of local feeling—which, as I shall show, is not altogether representative—he has chopped off three urban villages, describing them as
<br><blockquote><p>"straggling settlements along the roads across the moors to the North"</p></blockquote>
and left them in Lancashire.<br><br>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
The number of people involved is relatively small, comprising 378 electors in Belmont, 435 in Chapeltown, 1,398 in Edgworth and perhaps a further 200 in the excluded part of the Egerton ward—possibly 3,000 people in all. The maps provided—my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South (Mr. Michael Cocks) made this point—do not indicate at all clearly the nature of this development. In fact, they might lend credence to the view of the Minister that these are straggling villages.<br><br>
I was unable to discover a satisfactory relief map. Perhaps the hon. Member for Bolton, East (Mr. Laurance Reed) was able to do so. But I was recently presented with the illustrated tea cloth which I have with me and which shows rather more clearly the way in which the Turton area has been bifurcated. I apologise to the Committee for washing my dirty linen in public. I do so simply to show rather more clearly than the Minister's map does the way in which the Urban District Council has been divided.<br><br>
It is perhaps ironic that much of the excluded areas—the areas north of the red line—represent an area owned by Bolton Corporation as gathering grounds for its reservoirs. Of course, that is only the present situation, since other proposals will alter the ownership of water supplies. However, it is important that half of the excluded area already forms part of Bolton's assets.<br><br>
There are, of course, mixed feelings in the area about local government reform. The Council, like many other small authorities, tends to favour the view, "Rather the devil we do not know
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0218">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 389</span>
than the devil we know", The presence of Bolton on its doorstep has created certain fears and antipathies, perhaps through one or two unwise remarks made by leading people in the area. The local council is, of course, reluctant to see its disappearance into a metropolitan district. However, some of the expressions of local opinion I have received have made it clear that Bolton is the natural shopping centre for the whole of the urban district, as studies by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government have shown, and that the increase in population which occurred over the past decade—a growth of 58 per cent. in the whole of the urban district council—has occurred through people who have come principally from Bolton and Manchester, and who travel to work in those cities.<br><br>
It is difficult to find any evidence of people moving from the other parts of the proposed Lancashire County into the Turton area or commuting from Turton into Darwen or Blackburn, the towns on the other side of the hill with which Turton will probably be grouped in a new county district. All the essential services for these communities—refuse collection, road salting and snow clearing—could best be administered from Bolton. Indeed, it can be clearly seen from the relief map that the barriers of the hills to the north could cut off Blackburn and Darwen from Turton and prevent facilities such as salt-laying and snow-clearing from being carried out during periods of snow, ice and fog.<br><br>
It is additionally important to realise, for example, that the Turton High School, which is comprehensive, has recently been made the only centre of secondary education for the whole of the Turton Urban District Council. Following the reorganisation of local government, there will be considerable difficulties caused when children from the area have to go over the hills to other schools in Darwen and Blackburn. Such services as water, sewerage, electricity, gas, ambulance and hospitals are all at present provided by the Bolton County Borough, or authorities based in Bolton. People would not wish to go to hospital in Blackburn, for example. Furthermore, such functions as visits to the registrar of births, marriages and deaths are much more easily carried out by visiting Bolton, as at present.<br><br>
I now come to the views which I have
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 390</span>
received from one of the three councillors, speaking on behalf of all the councillors from the Belmont ward of Turton, which indicate the strength of feeling which prevails, although it is fair to point out that other parts of the urban district hold other views. He wrote to me that they had
<br><blockquote><p>"held a successful meeting at Belmont las Thursday."—</p></blockquote>
that is, two-and-a-half weeks ago—
<br><blockquote><p>"Over 50 people came. It might not seem a large gathering but people were having to stand in the School Hall and it was over twice as large as any political or public meeting in the village in recent years. About 14 per cent. of the electorate attended and I think this gathering was as representative of public opinion as any meeting of this sort is likely to be. Thirty-six people supported a proposal for the inclusion of Belmont in a Bolton Metropolitan District and nine were opposed, there being a few abstentions. Thus over three quarters of those present clearly disagreed with the Government's proposals."</p></blockquote>
He went on to make further points, which I mention in concluding my remarks on this group of Amendments. He wrote:
<br><blockquote><p>"The people of Belmont use the shopping and cultural amenities of Bolton. They support Bolton Wanderers and not Blackburn Rovers…. Belmont comes within the distribution area of the Bolton Evening News and not of the Blackburn Evening Telegraph. If Belmont was placed in the Blackburn County District"—</p></blockquote>
as has been proposed by Lancashire County Council in its draft proposals on county districts
<br><blockquote><p>"it would be unlikely therefore to receive press coverage of County District Meetings."</p></blockquote>
That is a very important point, in terms of the efficacy of democracy in this reorganisation. Possibly even more important, the letter continued:
<br><blockquote><p>"The return fare to Bolton is 14p. The return fare to Blackburn is 58p. This is important when people have occasion to visit the local government administrative headquarters. It takes 25 minutes to travel from Belmont to Bolton by public transport. The journey from Belmont to Blackburn by public transport requires a change of buses and the first part of the journey is to Bolton. If connections are favourable, the journey takes 90 mintues. If connections are unfavourable, it can take up to 120 minutes. Few people in Bolton have not heard of Belmont. Many visit it and enjoy and appreciate it, regarding it as an amenity of Bolton. Few people in Blackburn have heard of Belmont, fewer know where it is, fewer visit it land none of them regards it as an amenity of Blackburn."</p></blockquote>
I hope that we shall be able to ensure that the people of Belmont and those of the other excluded areas of the Turton Urban District Council will be able to

maintain their links with the Bolton area, as part of the reorganisation of local government, and not be hived off as a result of this Judgment of Solomon.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 133 and 134 attempt to prevent the bifurcation of Ramsbottom. Here the North ward and the Walmersley-cum-Shuttleworth ward have been excluded. The council, again like the Turton Urban District Council, is most anxious that the whole of Ramsbottom be excluded and are carrying out various activities to bring this retention of officials.<br><br>
There is general agreement, I think, that the division is profoundly unsatisfactory. I have referred to the visit of the Under-Secretary to Ramsbottom last week, and the views of the Chairman of the Ramsbottom Urban District Council to the man in Whitehall who drew this line on the map. It seems to me to be a totally artificial division of Ramsbottom, and there is no good case for proceeding with it.<br><br>
To cite an example: if one goes from Ramsbottom into the North ward, the Stubbins area, one is going through a continuous built-up area, and this seems to be quite the wrong place in which to divide an urban district, if it is necessary to divide an urban district at all<br><br>
The next group of Amendments, Nos. 137 and 138, deal with the Tintwistle rural district, the Glossop municipal borough and the parishes of Charlesworth and Chisworth. Glossop is at the end of the commuter railway line into Manchester. It is also serviced by public transport from Manchester, and a large number of its people work in the Manchester area. In 1966 one-third of the working population travelled to the conurbation; today a larger number now travel to work daily in the Greater Manchester area. There has been a building-up of the area between Glossop and Hyde as a result of the Hattersley overspill development, and in the last six years the Manchester County Borough has built 1,418 overspill houses in the Gainesley and Hadfield districts of Glossop. There is also a good deal of private development.<br><br>
The question of local newspapers is also relevant. The <i>Glossop Chronicle</i> is part of the <i>Ashton Reporter</i> group of newspapers, and therefore would carry the news concerning <i>District</i> (<i>f</i>). It does not carry any news concerning the Derbyshire County Council area. The links between Glossop
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 392</span>
and the rest of Derbyshire are extremely tenuous. It is difficult to get to the rest of Derbyshire, and I find it difficult to understand why this opportunity has not been taken to include it with its natural neighbours in the Manchester conurbation. Glossop is an industrial town very similar to others in metropolitan <i>District</i> (<i>f</i>), and I think that that is where it should be included.<br><br>
The two parishes of Charlesworth and Chisworth, which are included, are linked for various administrative and economic reasons with Glossop, and if one were putting Glossop into <i>District</i> (<i>f</i>), I think one would inevitably have to include Charlesworth and Chisworth as, of course, the Minister did himself in the proposals put forward in February last.<br><br>
The Rural District of Tintwistle, which is one of the smallest local authorities in the country, with a population of only 1,400 people, has no links at all, except for propinquity, with Derbyshire. There are no public transport links between Tintwistle and the rest of Derbyshire, and, of the active population, 38 per cent. are employed in the Greater Manchester area. Here there seems to be a curious drawing of the boundaries far too tightly round the conurbation and excluding areas which are naturally linked with Greater Manchester.<br><br>
The next Amendment, No. 136, affects the Disley Rural District and proposes to introduce Disley into <i>District</i> (<i>h</i>), which is based upon Stockport. Disley rural district has a population of 3,910 and this is an extraordinary change the Minister has made since the February proposals. Not even the Cheshire County Council could suggest dislodging Disley Rural District from the conurbation of which it is an essential part. There are no public transport links between Disley and the remaining parts of the Cheshire County Council, and there are very poor road links, consisting of a rather dusty B road over the mountains. The children attend secondary schools in the Greater Manchester area, or in Stockport and Marple. It is difficult to see how they could do otherwise, and there would be considerable costs in taking them down to Macclesfield or somewhere else to secondary schools.<br><br>
Over 40 per cent. of the economically active population work in the Greater Manchester conurbation, and the people of Disley use Stockport and Manchester for shopping; the hospitals, the post office, the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0220">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 393</span>
telephones are all based upon Stockport which is obviously the natural focus of this area. I hope the Minister will look again very carefully at this particular decision, which seems to me to be totally irrational.<br><br>
Amendment No. 256 endeavours to bring the two urban districts adjoining Disley, those of Whaley Bridge and New Mills, into the Stockport <i>District</i> (<i>h</i>). These are two industrialised Derbyshire towns and they look towards Stockport rather than Derbyshire. Although the argument for including these two towns in Stockport is perhaps not as clear-cut as that for Disley, or the argument for including Glossop in <i>District</i> (<i>f</i>), I would like to know the Minister's views for changing his mind from the proposals in the document circulated in February.</span></p>
<p>[Mr. ARTHUR JONES <i>in the Chair.</i>]</p>
<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I now come to Amendment No. 135, which proposes to bring Alderley Edge into <i>District</i> (<i>h</i>), the Stockport metropolitan district. Alderley Edge, which is a very desirable residential area on the south side of Manchester, has close links with Wilmslow. For planning purposes, Wilmslow and Alderley Edge are one town map; road proposals are made for Wilmslow and Alderley Edge together. It is a commuter area for Manchester, and there are no sensible reasons for its exclusion. Its links with the rest of Cheshire are extremely weak.<br><br>
I have tried to describe this group of Amendments which bring in the area surrounding the Greater Manchester county, and which were included in the Minister's proposals in February, but which have been excluded now. I think that the exclusion is an unfortunate step.<br><br>
Before I sit down, I should like to speak to two more Amendments, which bring in areas which were already excluded in the February proposals, Amendments Nos. 225 and 227, which bring the Culcheth and Newchurch wards of the Golborne Urban District Council out of the proposed Cheshire County Council, and back into <i>District</i> (12.) with the rest of the Golborne Urban District.<br><br>
I do not understand why the two wards of Golborne have been excluded from the Greater Manchester <i>District</i> (<i>a</i>), the Wigan district, and I do not think that the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 394</span>
Golborne Urban District Council do either. I would like an answer from the Minister.<br><br>
I have a letter from the Golborne Urban District Council, dated 7th December, which says:
<br><blockquote><p>"That this Council confirms its view that no part of the Urban District of Golborne should be separated from the remainder consequent upon the reorganisation of Local Government boundaries and that the Secretary of State for the Environment be informed that it is the Council's wish that the wards of Culcheth and Newchurch be included in the Wigan/Leigh District of the proposed Greater Manchester Metropolitan County along with the remaining wards."</p></blockquote>
I hope the Minister will give a satisfactory reply to the Golborne Urban District Council as to the reasons why its boundaries have been truncated in this way. The wards have close affinities with the areas to the north of Golborne, to Leigh and Tyldesley. Communications are as good towards Leigh as they are towards Cheshire and Warrington. I am loth to see further parts of the Greater Manchester conurbation eroded in this manner.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fitch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend permit me to interrupt? I used to live in one of these wards, the Culcheth ward, and the communications with Leigh are better than they are with Warrington.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Wigan (Mr. Fitch). This is one part of that conurbation which I do not know as well as he does. His intervention has clarified the situation. Communications with Leigh are better than they are with Warrington, as my hon. Friend says.<br><br>
I must apologise for the length of my speech, but I felt it better to speak to the whole group of Amendments at once, rather than to make individual interventions on each.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Reed</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper) has said so much, on so many places, that I find it difficult to follow him. I should like to re-focus the attention of the Committee on Amendment No. 130 to which I have added my name. That Amendment relates to Turton. Under the present proposals Turton and the neighbouring villages will be excluded from the new Bolton district. I support that Amendment on the grounds of geography, convenience and necessity.<br><br>
Turton is separated from Darwen by a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0221">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 395</span>
moor as high as 1,300 ft., and anyone looking at the map will see that it forms an integral part of the Bolton area. Many of those who live there are former Boltonians.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Farnworth has already mentioned the important transportation links between Bolton and this area, and the inadequacy of the transport between the area and Blackburn. He has mentioned the cultural link, that so many people from this area come into Bolton to shop, that they read the <i>Bolton Evening News</i> and not the <i>Blackburn Evening Telegraph,</i> that they support the Wanderers and not the Rovers. The hon. Member might also have mentioned that those in this area look to me and to the hon. and learned Member for Darwen (Mr. Fletcher-Cooke) for political inspiration, and not to Mrs. Castle.</span></p>
<p>[Sir STEPHEN MCADDEN <i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have arrived back in the nick of time to remind the hon. Gentleman that Members of Parliament are not referred to by name.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Sir Stephen. I meant the right hon. Lady the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle).<br><br>
The other advantage for the people living in this area is educational. At the moment anybody winning a place in a grammar school has only one school to attend, and must travel the moor to Darwen. If the area were included with Bolton, there would be immediate access to seven schools of grammar school status.<br><br>
The mothers in this area are dependent upon the Bolton Maternity and Child Welfare Clinic, and they look to Bolton for water, for sewerage, for disposal of one kind or another, for fire, ambulance, medical and other hospital services.<br><br>
I have received representations in support of inclusion in Bolton from Belmont, and representations opposing this from Egerton and from Chapeltown. Those who are opposed are mainly concerned at the threat of the area being built up for residential purposes if it is included in the Greater Manchester area, but the fear is not solidly based.<br><br>
I have a map—a far better map than anything the Government have produced—which has been drawn up for me by the borough planning officer, which I shall pass to my right hon. Friend for inspection.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 396</span>
The areas covered with green stripes are landscape, about three-quarters of the area in question. Areas coloured brown form a fifth of the area or thereabouts, and represent land which is over 1,000 ft. high. An eighth of the area is covered by-reservoirs, and, with the problems of pollution and the provision of adequate drainage, it is unlikely that anybody would build in the neighbourhood of those. In addition, about another eighth of the area is dedicated woodland. It is unlikely that there will be a massive build-up in the region in the future, as the people of Bolton look to the region as an amenity, using it for sailing and for all types of recreation, and will guard the area as zealously as anybody against encroachment from urban development.<br><br>
In essence those are my reasons for hoping that my right hon. Friend will consider accepting Amendment No. 130—reasons of geography, convenience and necessity.<br><br>
These disputes are not new to us in Bolton. Our history goes back a long way, and until about 1830 the area consisted of three towns, Bolton, Little Bolton and a place called The Haulgh. We were the first town to apply for incorporation under the Local Government Act of that time. There was great commotion and dispute about this, and much opposition was shown by the people of Little Bolton. An election was held, with some 9,000 ratepayers entitled to vote. The majority in favour of forming larger Bolton was 272, and that figure was only achieved after the examiner of the petitions decided to delete the names of the women who had voted in this referendum on the grounds that the views of females were of no interest whatsoever.<br><br>
Today the people in what are now wards in Bolton are happy and content to be part of this area. The mayor of the town and the leader of the town council come from one of these areas. I am sure that history will repeat itself, and that in time to come the people of Turton, Egerton and Chapeltown will also be happy and content to reside in Bolton.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I speak to Amendment No. 211 I should like to comment upon and support the views of the hon. Member for Bolton, East (Mr. Laurance Reed) and my hon. Friend the Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper), especially on Turton and Belmont. Before I became the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0222">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 397</span>
Member for Widnes, I had the honour lo represent Bolton, West. I have some considerable knowledge of the towns of the area, and I would associate myself entirely with the hon. Member for Bolton, East and with my hon. Friend in regard to the affinity of interest between Turton and Belmont with the present County Borough of Bolton. There are no links between this area and Blackburn, the area in which they are to be based.<br><br>
This is moorland area. It may be difficult for some members of the Committee to visualise that in Lancashire there are large areas of bare moorland, and that the whole approach of these areas, Turton and Belmont, is into Bolton itself. Even my hon. Friend's tea towel map cannot clearly show the Committee—although a picture might do better—how the natural tendency of people in Belmont and Turton is into the Bolton area.<br><br>
The reservoirs of Bolton Corporation are in Belmont. Belmont is a Sunday afternoon's journey for a picnic, and a lovely picnic, for the people of Bolton, who go there on fine Sunday afternoons. I cannot imagine people from Blackburn coming over the moors in that direction merely to go to Belmont, and I fully support what both hon. Members have said. I hope that the Minister of State listens to the argument, which is based on the community of interests—an important factor, as the Government stress in the White Paper.<br><br>
Before I come on to my Amendment, I should like to support my hon. Friend the Member for Farnworth in what he said about the Culcheth and Newchurch wards of the present urban district of Golborne. I too have received representations from Golborne which is mystified—that is the only possible description—as to why two wards of the existing urban district should be taken out of that urban district and put into another county altogether. My own constituency of Widnes is to be incorporated in the County of Cheshire. There are reasons for that, and, although there is some feeling locally on being incorporated into what some regard as an alien county, I have no Amendments on it down on the Order Paper. Widnes borders on the River Mersey and is contiguous with Cheshire. There is a bridge over to Cheshire. However, the whole basis of Culcheth and Newchurch, for shopping, for enter
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 398</span>
tainment, sport and everything else is, as the hon. Member for Wigan (Mr. Fitch) pointed out, into Leigh, and into Wigan itself. Quite properly these two wards of Golborne should stay with Golborne, and not be taken out and put into the county of Cheshire, where there is no link.<br><br>
Football has been used by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. When we talk of social geography we can look at an area and see which teams the people of that area support. That argument is not easily used in respect of Liverpool, Manchester and the great conurbations, but—</span></p>
<p>12 noon.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Soccer is an important factor in social geography, as well as being a world famous game. However, today, with more expense, with first-class players costing as much as £250,000 and certainly £200,000, it is becoming more and more difficult for the Boltons and the Blackburns, and indeed the Burnleys—[An hon. Member: "Or Accrington".] Accrington is finished. Burnley, for example, with a first-class side, find it difficult to maintain their position at the top. We may now have two Manchesters in the first division, but Blackburn could be in the fourth division next year, although I hope not.<br><br>
I suggest that the matter of football and its appeal over an area is lessening in the Lancashire towns in the context of distance over which a magnetic social pull is exercised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can see my hon. Friend's point. There is a growing tendency to support and to go along to the top division clubs. As to feelings in other divisions, what the people of an area support is important—for example, in this case, whether they support Blackburn or Bolton. It shows where their main interests lie. Everybody may support Manchester United or Manchester City, but I am not talking about soccer on the Amendment which I am now discussing—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not only soccer. Cricket is extremely important in Lancashire. League cricket has built up around the Lancashire towns. We have not mentioned that an excluded part of Turton, the Egerton Cricket Ground, is mentioned in the Schedule. In Part III of Schedule 1 the boundary is demarcated excluding the Egerton Cricket Ground
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0223">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 399</span>
from the Bolton metropolitan district and yet Egerton plays within the Bolton metropolitan district, as does Edgworth.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A good point. Would the hon. Member deal with that point in the context of the Middlesex County Cricket Club, which exists with no local authority associations at all?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I was enjoying the speech of the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes), but there is a danger of his being interrupted so often that we lose the thread of his argument. I hope he will not go into the history of the various football clubs, as he has been tempted to do, but will get on with the speech he was making which was relevant to the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fitch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to go into the history of the football clubs. The great sport in the Leigh, Wigan and Culcheth areas is Rugby League, and not Association Football. The people of Culcheth, where I used to live, are followers of Wigan and Leigh rather than Warrington.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Mr. Gordon Oakes, to resume his speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was exactly the point I intended to make before the sports round-up began.<br><br>
I come to Amendment No. 211, to which I have put my name. I hope the Committee have noted that my hon. Friend the Member for Rochdale (Mr. McCann) and the hon. Member for Bury and Radcliffe (Mr. Fidler)—two hon. Members on opposite sides politically, neither on the Committee although both spoke on Second Reading—have added theirs. They unite on the matter of the metropolitan district proposed in the Bill which seeks to unite two entirely different places, the County Borough of Bury and the County Borough of Rochdale. I can only conclude that this is an administrative arrangement. Knowing the area, and coming from Lancashire, I know perfectly well that there is little, if any, community of interest between the two great county boroughs, or their people.<br><br>
Community of interest is a matter on which the Government laid great stress in the White Paper. In paragraph 8 they say:
<br><blockquote><p>"Local authority areas should be related to areas within which people have a common
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 400</span>
interest through living in a recognisable community, through the links of employment, shopping or social activities, or through history and tradition. Local boundaries, the allocation of responsibilities and the system as a whole should be understood and accepted as sensible by electors, by members and by officers."</p></blockquote>
The link-up by shotgun marriage between Bury and Rochdale is not acceptable to the hon. Members who represent those constituencies; nor is it acceptable to either of the councils, to the officers or to the people of the area. Consequently, the Amendment, which I put down on behalf of two hon. Members who are not members of the Committee, and whose arguments I fully support, knowing the area as I do, is to divide that metropolitan district into two perfectly good metropolitan districts, one based on the County Borough of Bury and the other on the County Borough of Rochdale.<br><br>
Each of the two towns has its own services; its own main post office branches, main telephone exchanges, Inland Revenue, Ministry of Social Security offices, county courts, hospitals, magistrates' courts, and offices of the Department of Employment and Productivity.<br><br>
Geographically they are separate and distinct. I hark back to geography because one of the difficulties is that those in the Ministry considering the matter did not have a relief map, but only a plain map, showing the geographical areas. Physical features around Bury and Rochdale divide the area into two separate river valley systems, one centred on Bury and the other on Rochdale, and separated by a ridge of high land running from north to south through Heywood. The centre of the new metropolitan area would be on top of that ridge of high land. The two authorities should clearly be divided into two separate metropolitan areas.<br><br>
The Minister of State may be wondering how viable this would be in respect of population, although I would emphasise that population is not the sole criterion. Community of interests is a more important criterion than population in any area. If the proposals in the Amendment were carried out, then, as the Minister of State was informed in a submission from the Town Clerk of the County Borough of Bury in May, 1971, the new metropolitan district of Bury would have a population of 175,140, and the population of the metropolitan district of Rochdale, if one included Middleton Borough, would be 206,630.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0224">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 401</span>
Those are the present population figures, but we are here concerned with a Bill that looks to local government for the future, and the projected figures of the Registrar-General are more important in this context than the present populations. They show, for the proposed Bury Metropolitan district, in 10 years' time, 1981, 205,300, and for 1991, 238,400. Rochdale metropolitan district would have 229,400 in 1981, and 247,490 in 1991. By any meaning of the term they are viable authorities. They are sufficiently large, and they have a community of interests. The councils of the areas concerned want it. The social geography of the area demands it.<br><br>
I ask the Minister to look seriously at the Amendment, which has been tabled by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee and which has the full support of the people and the councils of the areas concerned, and to exercise some flexibility with regard to this authority. If the hon. Gentleman is prepared to indicate that he sees some merit in the arguments put to him, not only by me this morning, but by other hon. Members on Second Reading, and by the councils concerned which have written to him on this subject, and that he will reconsider the points which have been raised, I shall be delighted not to press the Amendment.<br><br>
Will the hon. Gentleman take particular note of the fact that, as regards the Amendments to the Schedule, all hon. Members taking part in the discussion, particularly when their own constituency is involved, are speaking from the heart and with local knowledge and backing? Will he, therefore, show considerable flexibility, taking account of the clear and forceful arguments advanced in the Committee?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patrick Cormack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) has spoken eloquently on the Amendment. It was with some hesitation that I promised my hon. Friend the Member for Bury and Radcliffe (Mr. Fidler) that I would support the Amendment, because I am without detailed local knowledge of the area concerned. However, I decided to do so because it is important that Members of the House who are not members of the Committee should not see local issues of burning importance go by default.<br><br>
It appears to me that a most curious shotgun marriage, as the hon. Gentleman
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 402</span>
termed it, is being arranged in this case. Indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for Bury and Radcliffe, in a powerful speech on Second Reading, referred to the new concoction as "Botchdale". He said that the local people would regard it as such and that it could have only been dreamt up at some curious moment by officials who did not know the feelings of the local people concerned. It is extremely important that local feeling should be taken into account if the new local government structure, which I welcome, is to work.<br><br>
A very good point was made in the letter to which the hon. Gentleman referred, sent to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State on behalf of the County Borough of Bury in May of this year. The letter reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"Whilst approving the basic structure proposed"—</p></blockquote>
in other words, there is no opposition to the general principle of the White Paper and the Bill—
<br><blockquote><p>"my Council are, however, extremely concerned at, and opposed to, the Government's proposal to join the County Boroughs of Bury and Rochdale together into one Metropolitan District … as they are o£ the opinion that this proposed District would be unwieldy and unbalanced, would have no natural centre and would contain areas which have little or no community of interest. "With their personal knowledge of the social geography of the area my Council are convinced that this proposal would not provide for good Local Government and indeed would make the task of the new Authority very difficult indeed, if not impossible."</p></blockquote>
Those are powerful words. They come from the senior official of the County Borough of Bury, speaking on behalf of his Council. This is an issue which cuts across party, as indeed do all the debates on this Schedule. For that reason, I believe that the debates on the Schedule will be constructive, concerning as they do people who speak either from local knowledge or, as in my case, to put forward, on behalf of their hon. Friends, deeply felt local convictions.<br><br>
I should like briefly to refer to a letter which I received only yesterday from the Town Clerk of the County Borough of Bury. I was very touched by the letter, since there is obviously tremendous appreciation of my agreement to speak briefly in support of the case. The Town Clerk writes:
<br><blockquote><p>"An informal meeting of representatives of the Councils of Bury, Prestwich, Radcliffe, Tottington and Whitefield was held recently to discuss this matter, and they considered that in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0225">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 403</span>
the interests of good local government in the area it is imperative that the amendment succeeds."</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend the Minister is a just man, who has a great and real regard for just this kind of local feeling, eloquently expressed, as in the letter which I have quoted. I beg him not to let these earnest pleas fall on deaf ears, but to reconsider these matters of acute local concern. If he persists in proceeding in accordance with the terms of the Bill, he could jeopardise the very success of that Bill, the broad principles of which I personally support.</span></p>

I am glad to have the opportunity of advocating that special consideration should be given to this small, free-standing village, at present situated in Cheshire. It is clear that local feeling, which my hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield has asked me to reflect, is in favour of this small community staying within the county of Cheshire rather than being absorbed as scheduled in the Metropolitan District of Greater Manchester.<br><br>
The village stands in the green belt of North Cheshire, in open countryside, with, I understand, local countryside lying to the north of the village and the great urban area which will form the Greater Manchester Metropolitan area. Understandably, there is a local community of spirit in this village, which is enclosed unto itself in the rural countryside and which has played its part to the full in local parish affairs and in rural council affairs in this part of North Cheshire.<br><br>
I understand that it is proposed to take only nine parishes into the Greater Manchester Metropolitan area, one of which is Poynton-with-Worth. One important question is concerned with education. The village contains a secondary school which serves a large surrounding district particularly meeting the requirements of children from Pott Shrigley and Aldington, who undergo primary education in their
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 404</span>
own local schools and later enter the secondary school at Poynton. I submit that it is not a good arrangement for children to move out of North Cheshire into the proposed metropolitan area of Manchester. Nor is it educationally desirable, as it may well be found that differing systems of education obtain between the new County of Cheshire and the Manchester Metropolitan Area.<br><br>
The proposal to take this small village out of Cheshire into Manchester must be seen to be justified. Unless the case is overwhelming, surely the advocacy for the village remaining in Cheshire is overwhelming?</span></p>
<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes), the hon. Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack) and the hon. Member for Northants, South (Mr. Arthur Jones) by saying this. I hope the Minister is listening to the points that are being made, and that it is not some form of charade. I would not have raised the point but for two things. First, there is an article in <i>New Society</i> for 9th December, on page 1148, entitled "The politics of reform" in which it is clearly set out—I do not know whether the Minister has seen it—that there is no intention whatever of making any concessions, even on boundaries, that the Government have not already decided to concede. The second is the rather curious speech made by the Under-Secretary earlier this morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Development (Mr. Graham Page)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have not seen that article, and I do not know from where they could have obtained that information. The right hon. Gentleman's first point is entirely untrue. We have been listening to these arguments and we are prepared to be flexible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to hear. that. I now want to deal with the Under-Secretary's speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Thomas</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that applies to the Welsh Office.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not speak for Wales.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary was chiding us earlier this morning with having wasted the time of the Committee. In view of that fact, I will make my
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0226">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 405</span>
comments as short as I can and as appropriate as I can.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary said that we were wasting time on this side of the Committee. He ignored the fact that there were some questions that were of vital consideration to us. He ignored the fact that we did not oppose the Sittings Motion. Indeed, we suggested that there should be three Sittings a week, with Tuesday afternoon being open-ended. He ignored the fact that since 11 o'clock this morning, and on many previous occasions, it is we, on this side of the Committee, who have kept the quorum. If the hon. Gentleman cares to look around he will see for himself that there is not a quorum opposite. We have used no procedural tricks. We do not intend to. This is an important Bill and deserves to be considered Clause by Clause and Schedule by Schedule. That is what we are doing. We are doing what an Opposition ought to be doing. The hon. Gentleman should stick to Question rigging and not bother trying to teach us our job.<br><br>
Having said that, I come now to the Amendments dealing with Greater Manchester. I had not intended to intervene, but it has been an extremely interesting and important debate. It shows someone like myself, who has no great geographical acquaintance with the area in question, that important considerations of this sort really do arise and ought to be taken into account.<br><br>
When one is dealing with any local government change, there are four communities which one should consider. First, there should be in any area of municipal authority a community of interest. Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have drawn attention to what these various forms of community of interest are. There is football, whether Association or Rugby League. There is cricket. There are sports of all kinds. There are local newspapers. These are more important in the provinces than in London where they have tended to decline over the years. There is schooling. This is an important question because obviously authorities will change in the light of local government reorganisation. There is community travel. These are the things which are concerned in the community of interest.<br><br>
The second is community of population. Obviously it must be a contiguous area.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 406</span>
One cannot have divided areas, although in London there is one such area where North Woolwich, as the Minister knows, is separated as a kind of colony from the rest of Woolwich on the other side of the Thames. But this is a very unusual situation, and one that the Bill is trying to avoid. There should be contiguity. There should be a community of population in the areas.<br><br>
The third is community of transportation. People should be able to travel logically to the centre and away from the centre of a conurbation. The S.E.L.N.E.C. Passenger Transport Authority includes the whole of the various areas which are proposed to be excluded by the Bill: Ramsbottom, Turton, Tintwistle, Glossop, Disley and Alderley Edge, either in total or in large part. I hope I have properly understood the arguments. If that is so, the Minister is sorting out some extraordinary complications for himself if these areas are excluded. They look, from a transportation point of view, right into the centre and ought to be so considered.<br><br>
The fourth is the community of planning. One should take an area that ought to be planned as a whole rather than in different parts. This is always a difficult point. Geography has a tendency to intervene and perhaps to cloud the issue somewhat. But the exclusion of the areas which I have mentioned does militate against good planning. I drew attention on Second Reading to what some of my hon. Friends and I considered to be a defect in the drawing of metropolitan county boundaries, and that is the tightness with which they are drawn. One sometimes gets into an argument as to whether it is.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper), in a very powerful speech, perhaps over-stressed the question of housing. It might be that he really meant to say that it was not the only important thing that should be considered. That is more likely what was in his mind.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Bolton, East (Mr. Laurance Reed) put the point very well indeed. He was talking not only about the planning of an area but about the inclusion of its woodlands, its heights and its hills—in other words, the creation of a lung to an area.<br><br>
In drawing the boundaries of this conurbation so tightly, the Minister has not given the area the chance it should have to expand, to breathe as an area and be planned as an area so that it may
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0227">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 407</span>
have its own open spaces and its own town as well.<br><br>
These were the things which impressed me. I do not know what advice I could give to my hon. Friends about this series of Amendments. With respect to my hon. Friend the Member for Wigan (Mr. Fitch), who is always eloquent and a joy to listen to, he did not totally carry me with him. Some of my other hon. Friends did, and so did the hon. Member for Bolton, East. I had not considered this to be as important as it clearly is. Perhaps the best course is to hear what the Minister has to say, and, if he gives us some indication that he may be willing to look at this again, to leave the matter open until Report. But this is a matter upon which the Minister should enlighten us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I say at the beginning of the first reply on the issue of boundaries arising under Schedule 1 that I have real sympathy with the views expressed by the right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin). Without trying to swap quotations in any way, I think the right hon. Gentleman will have sympathy with many of the phrases which first saw the light of day in the White Paper. Intellectually it is attractive, when one is dealing with so complex and all-embracing a subject as local government reorganisation, to try to find a set of standards and guidelines by which one can award, so to speak, metaphoric points to each case and say "that is in" and "that is out".<br><br>
That is where one starts, and I would not want in any way to take issue with the hon. Member on the community of four separate interests that he put forward as possibly providing a guideline. They make a great deal of sense. It is only when one comes down to individual cases, listens to individual arguments and meets the people individually on the ground, that the immense difficulties of trying to fit the specific instances against a general background stare one in the face.<br><br>
As one of the Ministers who, literally, spent many hours listening to the elected representatives of the people in the areas which we are discussing, and having flown over and driven over the areas concerned, I make it clear to the Committee that it is very difficult, and in many cases impossible, to find such a set of background standards which could be applied. One has in mind the general principle that was
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 408</span>
set out in the White Paper, and the general view which we have taken, that wherever possible we wanted to listen to what people had to say to us and then try to meet the views they put forward.<br><br>
This deals, as my hon. Friend has already done, with the point that we have no interest in being flexible and have already made up our mind. That is far from the truth. The difficulty is that there is a large number of issues in which the balance of argument is very fine and on which one person might reach a different decision from another. In the end, decisions have to be taken; and in the balancing exercise, which we shall now begin to discuss, perhaps we can try to explain some of the reasons that influenced us in reaching the decision that we did, and which was published in the Schedule which we are debating.<br><br>
12.30 p.m.<br><br>
The first Amendment is No. 205, which is linked with Amendment No. 206. The purpose of this pair of Amendments is to i move Westhoughton urban district from <i>District</i> (<i>b</i>) in Greater Manchester, which is centred on Bolton, to Greater Manchester <i>District</i> (<i>a</i>) centred on Wigan. Westhoughton has a population of about 18,000 and it immediately adjoins the county borough of Bolton. It is perfectly true that development is not completely continuous: there is a small distance from Wigan on the other side, but it is closer to the county borough of Bolton. In terms of geographical separation, therefore, there is a greater proximity to Bolton county borough and the district of which Bolton is the core than there would be if we were to accept these Amendments.<br><br>
The second factor, which I think is important in this case, is that the Bolton district is itself smaller than the Wigan district. Therefore, if this switch were to be made, it would tip the balance even further in the direction which already exists, and the population figures would drop from 258,000 at present in the Bolton district to about 240,000. On the other hand, the Wigan district already has a population of 305,000 without Westhoughton.<br><br>
It seemed, on balance, that the argument was in favour of linking Westhoughton with Bolton. I hope that the hon. Member for Wigan (Mr. Fitch) will feel that this situation has progressed as we propose.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fitch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with what the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0228">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 409</span>
Minister has said so far, but one thing that ought to be taken into consideration and which I hope the Minister will consider is the unanimous opinion of the members of all <i>parties on</i> Westhoughton Urban District Council that they should go into <i>District</i> (<i>a</i>) and not <i>District</i> (<i>b</i>).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Reed</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That does not agree with the view of the people of Westhoughton, who take a totally different view.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I fully accept that there is this view, and it is very much the view of the power structure that is likely to develop, because I think that the people of Westhoughton feel that they would have greater influence if they were to be moved than they will if they remain where they are. This is a legitimate view for the local authority representatives to put forward. However, I am not sure that it is one in reality or that it is related to the interests of the people they represent. Therefore, although I have tried to bear in mind all the factors raised, I do not think that I could advise my hon. Friends that this Amendment should be accepted.<br><br>
The next group of Amendments is Nos. 225 and 227, dealing with the urban district of Golborne, which was referred to by the hon. Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper). The aim of these Amendments is that the two wards of Culcheth and Newchurch should move from the new county of Cheshire into <i>District</i> (<i>a</i>) within the Greater Manchester conurbation, so that the whole of the urban district would be within the metropolitan district based on Wigan.<br><br>
The population in the urban district is about 28,000 and it is our view that this is separated into quite identifiable individual communities. The northern part of the urban district, which is the town of Golborne itself, is the centre of an industrial area largely centred on mining and silk, and in our judgment is closely linked with Wigan. That is why the greater part of the urban district was included in <i>District</i> (<i>a</i>) which is based on Wigan within Greater Manchester. But the area which has been left out—namely, the south-eastern part of Golborne—is more rural, and our judgment is that the settlements have developed primarily as commuting dormitories, first to the wartime factory of Risley and subsequently to the atomic energy establishment at Risley, as well as to Warrington itself.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 410</span>
The orientation, therefore, is more towards Cheshire than it is towards Manchester, towards the Wigan district. This was the balance of arguments that seemed to us to confirm the totally different character of the two divisions of the Golborne area. As the north-west seemed to fall logically into the Wigan district, and as the south seemed to point directly in the Cheshire areas, we felt that this division was reasonable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cocks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As this is the first reply we are having from the Government Front Bench on the Schedule, would the Minister say a word about the point he has just made? The hon. Gentleman illustrated his argument by saying that one area is more rural than the other. With the best will in the world, we cannot check that information. Is it really beyond the wit of the Government to provide at least one set of Ordnance Survey maps here which could be easily referred to, so that the whole proceedings of the Committee can be expedited and we can the more readily understand the sort of point the Minister has just made?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We costed this and learned that to provide such maps to each member of the Committee would be extremely expensive. Perhaps we might provide them in the Committee Room, for reference.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That would be very suitable, Sir Stephen, and it would meet my hon. Friend's point. I suggest one on either side of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary was just dealing with the question of the commuting patterns from the Newchurch and Culcheth wards being different from the other parts of Golborne. We do not have any journey-to-work figures covering these parts of an urban district. We have them only for the urban district as a whole. Has the hon. Gentleman any figures from the ward or enumeration district analysis which presumably has been done for his Department, showing that this is or is not the case?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Certainly. This is the sort of factor which is being taken into account in trying to reach these decisions. On this detailed point, I will write to the hon. Member and give him whatever information is available. The difficulty is always, when one gets down to very narrow points, to indicate the precise
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0229">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 411</span>
figures that might be relevant. I will try to help the hon. Gentleman if I can.<br><br>
Amendment No. 255 deals with the three parishes to the north-west of Wigan—Parbold, Dal ton and Wrightington. The effect of the Amendment would be to move these three parishes back into Greater Manchester. They were in Greater Manchester in the original Circular in May and were removed following the consultative processes which we undertook.<br><br>
The representatives of these parishes were very eloquent in asking that they should be allowed to continue as part of Lancashire. I looked very carefully at the geographical lie of the land, and it seemed that the parishes consisted largely of open countryside, with the hills rising out of the South Lancashire plain. There is an element of commuter development spreading into these villages, but it did not seem to me that it had spread to the extent of swamping the villages, nor had it changed their character. There is a quite distinct band separating the villages from the tighter urban development of the conurbation. It seemed to be legitimate to heed the wishes of the local people and agree with their proposals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Did the Minister take into account the Wrightington Hospital? Most of the patients treated there come from the Greater Manchester area.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was very impressed by the arguments put to me on a number of occasions about hospitals, and I satisfied myself that the choice of doctors and the use of local hospital facilities would not be affected by the proposed drawing of local government boundaries. I cleared that in my own mind before any arrangements were embodied in the proposals as published.<br><br>
The next group of Amendments—Nos. 130 to 134—were spoken to by the hon. Member for Farnworth, who referred to the judgment of Solomon. This is the group of Amendments dealing with the Turton and Ramsbottom Urban District Councils. His description of it as a judgment of Solomon is very accurate. It was a difficult situation and, looking at the maps which the Department has produced, I think that anybody—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Reed</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend bear in mind that the judgment of Solomon was never carried out?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 412</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Every so often people make a very good intervention; and I would not wish to diminish the impact of that intervention. As is the way with this Government, we are determined that our opinion should be carried out on this matter and we feel that we have reached a judgment which makes sense in the context of these two communities.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Farnworth quoted the population figures for the various wards which are left out of the conurbation. He indicated that in reaching our conclusions we took the very low population wards which did not automatically fall within the concept of a great conurbation.<br><br>
It is fair to make the point to my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, East (Mr. Laurance Reed) that, when I met the local authorities in this area, both Turton and Ramsbottom argued passionately to be allowed to stay outside the conurbation. One of the arguments they used with particular force and strength was that they were distinct communities identifiable individually and had little in common with the other authorities—in this instance, Bury and Rochdale. I thought that their arguments were right only in part. I thought that there were a considerable number of people in Ramsbottom and Turton who had relationships with Bury and Rochdale and that it would be wrong to—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are not referring to Bury and Rochdale but to Bolton and Bury, and there is no link at all with Rochdale.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry; the hon. Gentleman is right. We are referring to Turton and its relationship with Bolton and Ramsbottom and its relationship with Bury. It seemed to me that the arguments put forward by the two local authorities—Ramsbottom and Turton—that they were two individual communities which could be separated from Bolton and Bury were only partly right. The argument was correct concerning those areas to the north of the present urban districts which appeared to have a quite different character—much less densely populated, more rural and, particularly in the northern areas of Ramsbottom, associated very definitely with the character of the Rossendale valleys.<br><br>
In trying to help as much as possible, I asked if we could find a way of drawing lines that would reflect the very real difference which appeared to exist and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0230">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 413</span>
which was argued in generality by the representatives of the authorities that saw me. The results are the divisions which we are considering in the detailed map that has been provided.<br><br>
It would be quite impossible, taking ward boundaries as we have done, to find an ideal division. In the Bill we have provided for a tidying up process under the influence of the Boundaries Commission. I see this process as something which will deal with the anomalies to be found around the lines we have drawn. The lines themselves are broadly representative of the arguments put to me by the local authorities in so far as I was able to accept them.<br><br>
12.45 p.m.<br><br>
As to the difficulties envisaged by the hon. Member for Farnworth in many of the services he indicated which are now being administered from Bolton, there is no reason why in the <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements that will be made between one authority and another, the services should not continue to be administered from Bolton, in the short-term, after local government reorganisation. This will be a matter for discussion and negotiation between local authorities, and I have not the slightest doubt that they will be carried out very widely throughout the country to cope with the short-term adjustments and changes which are bound to follow from this legislation.<br><br>
Amendment No. 211 undoubtedly is the one which has detained the Committee longest in this group of Amendments. It is one of the harder decisions which has confronted us on local government reorganisation within metropolitan areas. Of all Members in the House who have taken an interest in local government reorganisation no one has been more assiduous in representing the interests of his constituents than my hon. Friend the Member for Bury and Radcliffe (Mr. Fidler), who is not a member of the Committee. He has put to us with a zealousness which I have never seen surpassed, and rarely seen equalled, the arguments on which he feels so strongly. Certainly the constituents who elected him to the House did themselves an immensely good turn in taking that decision. I do not put that on a party basis, I put it purely on a representative
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 414</span>
basis which all of us would seek to emulate.<br><br>
When we held a meeting in the conurbation to discuss this issue, we had a whole session devoted to the possible split of Bury and Rochdale. Amendment No. 211 would have the effect of creating two separate districts within the metropolitan area of Greater Manchester.<br><br>
It would be misleading for me not to say that the Government's view remains that it would not be in the best interests, either of the local people or of the form of local authority reorganisation which we are introducing, to accept this Amendment. Our reasons are not taken without great regard to the arguments put forward by hon. Members opposite and by my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack) in favour of this proposal. We have considered this proposal at great length and with immense care.<br><br>
In answer, I will now put the arguments as to why we were not able to change our minds. First, we believe that the two towns of Bury and Rochdale are broadly similar in that they are south-east Lancashire territory; they are a combination of old industrial towns and commuting into the centre—mainly to Manchester itself. We accept that there is a narrow strip of land between them which embraces Heywood and which would form part of the proposals that we have outlined.<br><br>
The second reason why we would find it difficult to accept is that it would then involve transferring the northern wards of Ramsbottom back into Manchester as outlined in Amendments Nos. 133 and 134.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry to have to remind hon. Gentlemen in the back row above the Gangway, who I know have many interests in common, that it would be better for them to have their "committee meeting" outside this Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The most important argument is on the size of the two districts that would come into being if these Amendments were accepted. The new proposals would give Bury a population of only 175,000. In place of our present proposals which create two strong districts—one based on Bury-Rochdale and the other on Oldham—we would end up with three under-sized metropolitan districts, the metropolitan districts of Bury, Rochdale and Oldham.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0231">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 415</span>
The figures which are before the Committee are Bury-Rochdale, 334,000 people and Oldham 277,000. If we were to accept the Amendments, Oldham would go down to 224,000; Rochdale would have 208,000 and Bury 180,000.<br><br>
In paragraph 12 of the White Paper we said that the 250,000 figure should be the lower limit for metropolitan districts. We also said that we
<br><blockquote><p>"should not be inflexible"</p></blockquote>
in applying this but that
<br><blockquote><p>"it should only be in special circumstances that these services"</p></blockquote>
—education and personal health services carried out by the metropolitan district—should be provided by populations below this range. Some metropolitan districts are below this range, but those were special circumstances where we could find no other solution, and in each case the Committee will want to look at those special circumstances when we reach them.<br><br>
To bring about the kind of a change envisaged would, in our view, lead to the possibility of a range of other smaller districts in metropolitan areas, and we should have established yet another precedent where there was no overwhelming case for so doing.<br><br>
The other argument put to me on Bury and Rochdale is that the figures will come within the range indicated by the White Paper, in a given time. The Government could not accept this. By 1980 the figures will still be substantially below the criterion, and it will be after 1991 before they become acceptable. We would be wrong for two reasons, first, because we would open up a whole range of discussions throughout the country about other population projections for 1990 and beyond, and second, because we have included in the Bill a review procedure to ensure that if there are to be changes, they will be covered by the various processes to which we will come when we look at the opportunities for review provided in the legislation.<br><br>
I regret that, despite the remarkable efforts made by my hon. Friend the Member for Bury and Radcliffe (Mr. Fidler), we would not feel able to recommend this Amendment to the Committee.<br><br>
Amendment No. 135, in the name of the hon. Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper), seeks to include Alderley Edge in the metropolitan area of Greater Manchester—another instance of a difficult decision.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 416</span>
The area continues through Wilmslow and out to Alderley Edge. I was, as the Committee knows, unable to accept the arguments as they were applied to Wilmslow; and the arguments for Leverhulme and Manchester seemed substantially on that side. As one progressed outwards, the gap between Alderley Edge and Wilmslow seemed sufficiently large to regard Alderley Edge as a community on its own, particularly when flying over the area. I am not suggesting that we should all take off to fly over the area, but if I may pray in aid this relatively small argument, my own particular experience is that I felt that gap to be credible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary had the advantage of flying over those areas. Commuter trains coming into Manchester start at Alderley Edge, for most of the inhabitants of Alderley Edge. I suspect that the train rather than the plane is the appropriate method of locomotion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is true, but the hon. Gentleman will appreciate that the feeling in Alderley Edge was overwhelmingly against being included in the Greater Manchester area. Taking all the arguments into account, we have gone as far as we needed to along that peninsula that juts out through Wilmslow, and we felt able to agree with what the local people wanted in that case.<br><br>
Amendment No. 136 proposes that the rural district of Disley should be put back into the Greater Manchester conurbation, and the arguments applying as to Alderley Edge.<br><br>
There are undoubtedly links with the conurbation for work, leisure and shopping. The importance of the train service was stressed to me in the consultations. However, driving through Disley, it definitely has the character of a village. I was much impressed, and thought it was a very attractive village, and I was delighted to see that it had been able to preserve that atmosphere in the face of all the pressures. A clear gap separates Disley from the conurbation, and this, with the very strong local feelings in favour of remaining in the County of Cheshire, influenced me finally to the view that we should try to agree with what had been requested.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the Under-Secretary leaves the question of Disley, would he be prepared to tell us something of his views on Lime Park? Lime Park is owned by the

National Trust and administered by the County Borough of Stockport. It occupies the largest proportion of land in the Rural District of Disley, and provides the lung for the County Borough of Stockport, which would seem—as mentioned by my right hon. Friend earlier—a very strong argument for including Disley in with the Stockport metropolitan district.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no reason why the administration should not be dealt with by the successor authorities. From my own experience—and I am sure hon. Members on both sides of the House will agree—the National Trust will be zealous in ensuring that adequate maintenance takes place. This is a routine adjustment which will be sorted out later.<br><br>
The same answer can be given to the question of the hon. Member about schools in Disley. Cheshire will need to look at this in the longer term when it comes to work out solutions. In the short term, the possibility of inter-county arrangements will perhaps be considered.<br><br>
The next group of Amendments—No. 137 and No. 138—dealt with the eastern side of the conurbation, the Derbyshire frontier, where the proposal is to bring Glossop back within the metropolitan area. This was another marginal case. Associated with Glossop are the communities of Tintwistle, Charlesworth and Chisworth, all of which were excluded after consultation.<br><br>
Glossop seemed to have two important characteristics: as a dormitory for the conurbation itself, and very definitely as an independent town. Its importance as the first has grown with the establishment of the Manchester County Borough estates, but these have by no means swamped the town or changed its character. The lie of the terrain certainly sets the town of Glossop apart from Greater Manchester, and that, coupled with the strong views of the small communities of Tintwistle, Charlesworth and Chisworth, and the equally strong views expressed by the representative of Glossop itself, would seem to tip the argument in favour of allowing those communities to remain independent within the new Derbyshire.<br><br>
I would mention that this gave rise to another of those questions on the hospital
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 418</span>
situation, which I have dealt with elsewhere.<br><br>
Amendment No. 237, which was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Northants, South (Mr. Arthur Jones), deals with the parish of Poynton-with-Worth. My hon. Friend may not be aware that the population of Poynton is some 11,000 people, and, having driven around and looked at it very carefully, I would not be able to describe it as a village separated from the conurbation. There is, it is true, a small green field gap, but it is very small. It would be wrong to separate Poynton from the conurbation, and I would ask my hon. Friend if he would consider withdrawing his Amendment. If one were to accept that Poynton should come out, one would find a whole range of communities on the edge of conurbations pleading the same case, and that would totally destroy the nature of what we are trying to achieve.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope the Minister will say something about Amendment No. 256, dealing with Whaley Bridge and New Mills.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought I had concluded the very large number of Amendments. However, Amendment No. 256 covers the eastern side, where a decision must be made as to whether New Mills and Whaley Bridge should be included in Derbyshire or in the Greater Manchester area. Both those communities can be seen as independent free-standing communities. The local authority representatives were firm in pleading this case, and, on balance, the arguments were on their side.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members on this side of the Committee—indeed, many hon. Members on both sides—will have found the Under-Secretary's reply exceedingly disappointing. A number of Amendments have been put forward; they have been argued from both sides of the Committee—</span></p>
