CONSTITUTION OF PRINCIPAL COUNCILS IN ENGLAND</div> <!-- title -->
<p>4.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 46, in page 2, line 41, leave out from "be" to end of line 42.<br><br>
The purpose of this Amendment is to ask the Minister what this subsection really means. It is very inelegantly worded, if I might say so; the subsection states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Each council mentioned in subsection (1) or (2) above shall be a body corporate by the name of the county or district council, as the case may be, with the addition of the name of the county or district".</p></blockquote>
When I first read that, I thought that it was one of those extremely rare things, a printer's error in the Bill, because it is very difficult to make any sense of it as it stands at the moment. Quite independently, my hon. Friend, who has another Amendment to delete this subsection—although he is not at present here to move it—was equally confused about the meaning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was looking after the Amendment for my hon. Friend, but the Amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) was so infinitely better that I thought it preferable not to move that Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged to my right hon. Friend for those kind remarks. As far as I can see, this wording could mean that one would have to say, for example. "the county council of Cheshire, Cheshire", or "the county council of Lancashire, Lancashire". It might get even worse, because it does not define whether one adds the name of the county or district. Does one then say, "the county council of Lancashire, Preston", which is the district in which the county council would be? It is very confusing, as it now stands. I am not labouring the point, Sir
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1070</span>
Stephen. I am sure that the Minister of State will have an adequate explanation, but although there may be reason behind it, is it not possible to word a statute a little more clearly and concisely?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Michael Heseltine)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) for putting his point so briefly and clearly. I was in some difficulty, because I was not sure of the purpose of his Amendment. I must admit that I did not know that it was what it has now materialised to be. This is the wording as taken from the 1933 Act. It has survived and worked, and everybody seems to have learnt to work with it. We have no hard feelings. There can be no objection to our looking at this again, between now and Report, to see whether it can be more clearly worded.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think it could be better worded if my hon. Friend's Amendment were accepted. This wording probably was in the 1933 Act. Possibly nobody noticed the point and it has just gone through, as often happens, from statute to statute. My hon. Friend's eyesight is extremely good. Euphoniously as one can make certain combinations of names, the fact that they make total nonsense is possibly a reason why, in 1972, we should put 1933 right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the fact that the Under-Secretary of State has said that he will look at it again—it is only a question of wording—I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1071</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This Amendment comes back to a debate which we had some considerable time ago, before we went through the infinite length of the Schedules, when I moved an Amendment that districts should be called boroughs, because the word "borough" had a distinction connected with local government that would elevate the rather flat-sounding "district" into a clearly recognisable word for a local authority. When I moved that Amendment, I subsequently withdrew it, because the Minister of State made it fairly clear to the Committee that any district which applied for borough status would be granted it. There would be no difficulty for an existing borough or, indeed, for a new district created under the Act that wanted to be a borough; if it petitioned the Queen for the status of a borough, invariably that status would be granted.<br><br>
My Amendment seeks to clear up some of the difficulties which would be put in the way of a district which applied for borough status, because, if this is so, one does not need this somewhat cumbersome procedure by which the Queen must receive the advice of her Privy Council who, if they think fit, will grant a charter.<br><br>
The effect of my Amendment is that if a district petitions the Queen for borough status, then, in accordance with what the Minister of State says, borough status will be granted. I am not being in any way discourteous to Her Majesty in the exercise of her discretion. I am merely avoiding unnecessary delay at a time when districts will have a lot to do. They are new authorities; they will have many problems. They will have a new area, new councillors and all sorts of problems which they possibly did not envisage. We do not want to put difficulties in their way at such a time.<br><br>
The other part of the Amendment is that for some reason the Clause requires a two-thirds majority of the councillors in the area to decide that their district wants borough status. I cannot see why on earth it should be a two-thirds majority. Why should it not be a simple majority, if 50 per cent. or over of the councillors request borough status? I agree that it should be at a special meeting. I am not seeking to amend that. It cannot be the sort of decision which is slipped in with "Any other business" at the end of a council meeting. It should then be decided like all issues, in nearly all authorities, on a simple
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1072</span>
majority of the councillors present and voting who decide that their district should receive borough status.<br><br>
If what the Minister said in reply to my earlier Amendment will be the case, namely that any district which applies for borough status will be granted that status, then I can really see no reason why the Amendment, although it may be somewhat untidy so far as wording is concerned, should not be accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Development (Mr. Graham Page)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Amendment were accepted, I understand that the first part of the Clause would read:
<br><blockquote><p>"If a petition is presented to Her Majesty by the council of a district praying for the grant of a charter under this section, Her Majesty may by the charter do all or any of the following:"</p></blockquote>
By this means it removes from the provisions of the Bill the reference to the Privy Council advising Her Majesty. Her Majesty will, in fact, be advised by some Minister and I presume that the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) would wish that. If one assumes that Her Majesty would act without the advice of a Minister, then there would be no one responsible to the House to answer Questions or to say why Her Majesty had not granted this petition or that petition. It is a perfectly well-established constitutional procedure, and the Minister responsible in the House would be the Lord President of the Council, for the advice given to Her Majesty by the Privy Council.<br><br>
I think it best to make it quite plain in the provisions of the Bill exactly how this procedure will operate. If I may say so, I speak as one who, before accepting ministerial office, practised at this very matter of presenting petitions for various purposes to the Privy Council. The procedure and practice of putting petitions through is very well planned in the Privy Council, and it would have to be done by another Government Department if we did not mention it as a petition to the Privy Council. I think it is right that we bring out clearly in this Clause the procedure and the ministerial responsibility for the advice given to Her Majesty.<br><br>
I understood from what the hon. Member for Widnes said that he thought that the words "think fit" refer to the Privy Council. I think not. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Her Majesty by the advice of Her Privy Council thinks fit to grant …"</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0584">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1073</span>
It is Her Majesty thinking fit, and not the Privy Council. It is she who thinks fit on the advice of the Privy Council. I do not think this will cause any delay. It would cause more delay if we left doubt as to how this machinery was to work, how the petition was to be presented, who was to deal with it and who was to be responsible to the House.<br><br>
On the second point which the hon. Member raises in these Amendments, he asked why there should be any particular formality other than a majority vote of the council for applying for a charter. There are certain matters in the Bill which we have thought to be of such importance that something more than a simple majority of the council is required, to make quite certain that these matters have a thoughtful decision by the council and are not pushed through on a snap vote. The important matters are the application for a charter, the change of name, the change of audit from private audit to district audit or <i>vice versa,</i> and the election of honorary aldermen and honorary freemen. The provisions as we have them now in the Bill are not as stringent as the provisions for applying for a charter at the present time. The present provisions for applying for a charter are that the resolution must be passed on two occasions a month apart at meetings of the council. We have only retained that formality in the one case of a local authority intending to apply for a private Bill. We thought that in drafting the present Bill it was right to adopt something which is well known to those who deal in company matters, a sort of special resolution of this proportion of the council after notice of the special meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I intervene briefly on two points. The first is one that comes up in most Committees, that it is not an Opposition's duty to act as unofficial and unpaid draftsmen for Her Majesty's Government. It is for Her Majesty's Government to employ their own draftsmen. Therefore, I never thought it a good point to say "The effect of so-and-so's drafting is to make nonsense of what he is trying to do", provided that it is clear what he is trying to do. I think it is very clear what my hon. Friend is trying to do.<br><br>
The second thing is that there are a number of local authorities throughout
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1074</span>
the country who might be very concerned by this. Taking the point as one of substance, I quite take the Minister's argument that there might be a simple majority, perhaps a majority of one, to seek borough status, which might be reversed at another meeting or another election. Basically, what my hon. Friend is seeking to do is to put the onus on the authority which wishes to become a borough.<br><br>
4.45 p.m.<br><br>
I should have thought that it would be quite possible for the Minister to take this Amendment away and look at it to see whether there is some other way to meet my hon. Friend's point. The obvious answer that would strike any hon. Member is that if there were a unanimous vote of the council, going for the title of borough is something that would either commend itself to the council as a whole or would not be worth doing, whether a charter was given or not. If one could get every councillor to accept this, then, surely, this ought to be good enough.<br><br>
I do not think it is necessary to go into which ministerial responsibility it is; the important thing is: is this the wish of the community as a whole?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roger Moate</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to comment on the point about a two-thirds majority. It seems to be an excellent proposition, but if one is going to engage in a major constitutional change of this nature, it should be seen to have the full support of at least the local authority and, possibly, even the people of the area.<br><br>
The convincing argument put forward by my hon. Friend troubles me a little. He is prepared to apply it to the local authority, but would it not be better to apply it to the country as a whole? On 28th October last a major constitutional step was taken and only 57 per cent. of this House actually voted in support of the proposition which would mean a major constitutional change in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Lamond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, should like to say a word about this two-thirds majority, but first of all I should say that I am a little alarmed by the suggestion of my right hon. Friend that we might simplify the procedure by allowing the assumption that borough status is required on a unanimous vote of the council. My
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0585">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1075</span>
experience of town councils is that there is always at least one awkward person who, for publicity reasons if nothing else, will object to almost anything that is proposed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Usually aldermen!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: While I think the Minister should try to simplify this matter, I hope it will not be simplified in the way suggested by my right hon. Friend. I also think the question of the two-thirds majority should be looked at, because although those who are involved in local authority work are quite familiar with this procedure, and it is common, that does not mean to say that it is right or acceptable.<br><br>
We in Parliament are prepared to accept a simple majority for even the most important change, but we seem to lack faith in those for whom we are passing laws. For example, in the Industrial Relations Act we had a long argument during the Committee stage about the majority which was required for various things to be done. Again, the Government seem to lack a certain faith in democracy if the members of the Government are not taking part in it themselves.<br><br>
I think we should let local authorities have the same freedom as we require and say that things that are to be done there, even if they are of a major nature, should be allowed on a simple majority of the council.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Might one not have the rather curious situation that one week the council decided by a simple majority to become a borough and the next week, by an equally simple majority, it decided to revert to a district? It might be a little awkward.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lamond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These things can happen, but they can happen in quite a number of important matters that come before councils now—when they take steps which may involve them in considerable financial outlay, for example, and they are in danger of having this decision overturned at the next meeting. However, I do not think that that should prevent them from having the same freedom as we have. After all, we can change our minds in Parliament too, I understand.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ted Leadbitter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is important for us to get away from the machinations of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1076</span>
local councils, though they are always interesting, and I speak as one who has spent a considerable time in local government.<br><br>
Any notion of a two-thirds majority invites all sorts of backstage agreements, understandings, misinterpretations and confusion. Simple majorities, left as they are, bring about the possibility that my right hon. Friend has mentioned. It is not unreasonable to suggest that if most of our public affairs are determined on a simple majority, we should, having accepted that principle, introduce something which deals with the difficulties that arise from so doing in certain fields. That is, we should introduce a locking device. In other words, when one has by a simple majority a decision about a constitutional change, for instance, or one regarding contracts, or the powers of a particular committee—there are many examples—there should be in the Standing Orders or written into the legislation through which local authorities work, a locking device by which the decision cannot be reversed for a period of time.<br><br>
Perhaps the Minister, with his considerable legalistic background, sees the desirability of seeking a solution to this problem through the principle of the simple majority that my hon. Friend has suggested. The problem mentioned by my right hon. Friend the Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) and others could be overcome by writing into the Bill some locking device procedure whereby the simple majority would not be misused.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) anticipated me on the point with regard to simple majorities that can be taken in the House. He did not continue, as I thought he might, to draw this parallel also, that where a district council takes the decision to be called a borough, that is the point of no return. It cannot cease to be a borough and return to being a district; there is no provision for so doing, so far as I can see. That is for all time. Yet he mentions 28th October. I could mention last Friday when, far from there being a two-thirds majority, so far as this House was concerned, we traded away our sovereignty on a simple majority. But, so far as a name is concerned, a borough council is not in a position to change its name from "district" to "borough" unless it has a two-thirds majority.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0586">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1077</span>
With regard to the Minister's reply, what I am trying to do is to cut out unnecessary red tape. If it is true—and I accept what the Minister said on this matter—that any district which wishes to be a borough can become a borough if it passes a resolution, even by a two-thirds majority, why go to the completely unnecessary expense and time-consuming procedure of taking the matter before the Privy Council for the Privy Council to advise Her Majesty, for what will be a foregone conclusion? The charter will be granted because the authority has requested a charter since, as we understand it, any district that wants to become a borough can become a borough. So why go through all this?<br><br>
It is not just a question of the time involved before the Privy Council. There will be a log jam of authorities in the next and following year, of boroughs and some districts which are not boroughs, all of which will be applying <i>ab initio</i> because they will want borough status right from the beginning.<br><br>
What exactly will the Privy Council do? How will it examine the claims and merits of the different districts in respect of borough status? If a local authority, whether by a two-thirds or by a simple majority, requests borough status, surely it could be granted. While that delay takes place—the Minister could not tell us how long the delay would be; this is not a simple academic point or a question of cutting out red tape—perhaps the Committee could think of what goes on in the local authority. The name, from the date of operation of the Bill, will be the district of "X". Then it applies for borough status. Meanwhile it is known as the district of "X", and all its letterheads, its blocks, its buses and its bin carts read "The District of X". Then it receives borough status; and, although we are suffering from a severe period of unemployment and, no doubt, the work would be welcomed by the painters' union and many other people, all that has to be altered to "The borough of X".<br><br>
I am exaggerating, but I think that the Minister and the Committee see my point. I accept that the wording of my Amendment might not, by the words that I have used, achieve what I want, but I think the Committee and the Minister know what I want. I want the position to be such that, without formality, a district can, at the beginning, decide that it wants to become
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1078</span>
a borough, and that, automatically, without any examination of its claim, it can become a borough, so that all the time-consuming red tape of going to the Privy Council and waiting for the Privy Council and Her Majesty to make a decision—the result of which will be inevitable if what the Minister said is so—will be avoided, along with the needless expense to local authorities, which can be considerable and which is borne by the public and the ratepayers, by a simple alteration of the Bill to accede to what the Minister himself said will be the position.<br><br>
I hope that he will look at the position again. The wording of my Amendment is far from sacrosanct, but I hope that the Minister will look again at the position in the light of the objects behind it, as distinct from the actual wording on the Amendment Paper.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think the latter part of the hon. Gentleman's speech is met by Clause 3(5). A district has merely to indicate its desire to become a borough, present its petition, and, without any further study of it at that point, Her Majesty can indicate that it has permission to use the style or title which it wishes to use—"the Borough of X" or whatever it may be. Right from the outset, the name of a borough can be used once the borough has presented its petition.<br><br>
This is not just a simple matter of the town clerk drawing up a document saying that Her Majesty grants the petition of the borough of X, and that is that. We shall have a good deal to sort out in the provisions of the charters; in the cases where there are, perhaps, three or four boroughs with existing charters in one district, or where perhaps the area of a borough stretches over more than one district, there will be much to get right in the actual drafting of the charter. If the town clerks and their advisers have the assistance of the Privy Council, who are used to this form of charter and know how its machinery works, there will be far less delay than if we leave it to a Government Department, whether it be the Department of the Environment or the Home Office, to see the matter through. We have the procedure in the Privy Council for doing it, and it is the quickest way to put it into operation.<br><br>
I should be very reluctant to give any assurance about removing those words from the Clause, because I am quite certain that by making it clear that this
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0587">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1079</span>
will be achieved by petition, in the ordinary way in which petitions have been granted for centuries past, this will be the speediest way of doing it.<br><br>
On the other point of the resolution by the district council, this, I may say, is an Amendment that was inspired by the A.M.C. As it seemed to be the desire of that local authority association, we looked at it carefully and it seemed to be the right progress from the existing law.<br><br>

I started from the position that under the existing law, if a local authority wishes to apply for a petition, it has to have not merely a majority vote but a majority of all the members, and not just those attending the meeting. That resolution has to be passed twice in two council meetings with a gap of more than one month. This is the present stringent provision for applying for a charter. The provision in the Bill is a reasonable compromise in order to ensure that a council considers this proposal fully, that it gives notice of the meeting at which it intends the resolution to be put, and that at that meeting two-thirds of those present at the meeting vote.<br><br>
One must remember that the quorum for a council is only a quarter of the total membership, so a snap decision might be taken which would not reflect the feeling of the council. I think this is the right compromise, and I do not feel inclined to give an undertaking for reconsideration of it at a later stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee is making good progress and it is not my intention to hold up the Committee, but I wish to take up the point made by the Minister of State about subsection (5). Of course, I have seen subsection (5). Can we get into perspective what will happen next year? The elections for district councils will take place in November, 1973. The proceedings of this Committee started in November. Next week it will be February. Between those months the elections have to take place; the council has to meet and hold its special meeting to decide that it wishes to become a borough; a petition then has to be sent to the Privy Council. It will not be the only one during those few months or weeks, but one of hundreds of petitions received during that time. As the Minister
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1080</span>
has said, the Privy Council and the committee and the people concerned with investigating the claims will have to look into all this log jam of applications for status in about December or January, 1973-74. The decision has to be made by 1st April, 1974, if all the bin carts and the dustbins are not to be changed.<br><br>
When one considers how long it has taken the Committee to reach this stage, can the Minister guarantee that, with that tremendous amount of work, the Privy Council Committee will be able within those few weeks to grant those charters to be in operation by 1st April and save all the unnecessary time, trouble and expense?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They do not have to be in operation by that date. They have to be presented and the Privy Council can advise Her Majesty there and then that she would be willing to grant a charter without all the details of the charter being worked out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is not an answer. If a district presents its petition before 1st April, has it then the authority, by merely presenting the petition on 1st April, to call itself a borough without that charter being granted? On 1st April, 1974 it has to have a name. It has to call itself the district of somewhere or the borough of somewhere, and that name has to appear on all its correspondence, vehicles and everywhere else.<br><br>
If the Privy Council can work a lot faster than this Committee works, and between November and April get all the petitions out from all those authorities, or alternatively, if on the mere presentation one can call oneself a borough without waiting for the Queen to grant the charter, my point would be met. I am sure that is not the position. These authorities will have to call themselves something on 1st April; they will be new authorities, new names, new districts. Let them get off to a good start and with the name that they will be called for the next several hundred years.<br><br>
All I am trying to do is to provide a formula that is devoid of red tape, that will save the expense of the authorities concerned and will allow an authority to have its own name right from the start.</span></p>

Amendment No. 198, in page 3, line 2, after "district", insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"not already possessing a charter"</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this Amendment we can take Amendment No. 199, in page 3, line 9, leave out paragraph (<i>b</i>).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cocks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I begin by quoting some remarks made by the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) this morning. I hope that he is not alarmed by the <i>rapport</i> which sparked between himself and this side of the Committee from time to time. He said that no one is in favour of change for change's sake, and that the purpose of the Amendments is to maintain the continuity of existing charters.<br><br>
Although I should like to think that I speak for all charter holders, I shall illustrate my argument by specific cases of the cities which are represented by the names on the Amendments. The hon. Member for Norwich, North (Mr. Wallace) spoke very strongly on Second Reading about this point and followed up with a letter to the Secretary of State for the Environment on the whole question of charters and of Norwich in particular, which received its charter in 1404. He wrote:
<br><blockquote><p>"… I sincerely trust that the Government will find ways and means of preserving what may be said to be one of the treasures of British life and which to a great extent has significant tourist value".</p></blockquote>
In Norwich as a whole this view is entirely supported, and the Norwich City Council, commenting on the Local Government Bill, said that it was deplorable that existing cities such as Norwich should have to petition for their ancient charters to be re-granted. I should like to feel that this is not a party point.<br><br>
I come to the question of Bristol. With all due respect to Norwich, when Norwich's charter was granted, Bristol's charter was already beginning to show signs of age and turn yellow. Bristol was the first provincial town to be made a county in 1373. I shall not weary the Committee by reading from the charter, but I shall tell them that the phrase "in perpetuity" occurs no fewer than three times. Next year we shall be celebrating the 600th anniversary of the granting of the charter, and the Corporation are already starting to discuss how best to undertake the celebrations to make it a great occasion.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1082</span>
The Government's proposals, however, will break the continuity, and unless the Minister relents, the celebrations will be clouded. It will be like merrymaking on the night before an execution and I am sure that the Government would not wish to be cast as the skeleton at this particular feast.<br><br>
I make this plea to the Minister because, as I have said in the Committee before, Bristol itself has no need of local government reform. It is a city with a long and glorious history; indeed, the Government have made frequent use, over the past months, of a famous Member of Parliament for Bristol, Edmund Burke, who represented the city from 1774 to 1780. He came to Bristol, having represented a rotten borough for nine years, to fight his only popular election, because he was attracted by the honour and the dignity of representing what was then the second city in the land. It is fair to say that he did not go down too well in Bristol, and he spent the remainder of his parliamentary career in another rotten borough for a further 14 years.<br><br>
If we look at the authorities on British borough charters, Ballard, in his introduction, makes the point that the charters are now historical documents and they are very rarely, if ever, referred to for the day-to-day running of municipal affairs. Weinbaum—another authority on British borough charters—makes the point, which I want to emphasise to the Minister, that charters of any given borough are the still-recognised landmarks of civic history. It is this point of historical tradition that I beg the Minister to consider. I can see no reason why existing charters should not continue. I cannot see that there are any arguments on the grounds of cost or administration; having listened to my hon. Friend the Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) on the previous group of Amendments, I feel that a great deal of work, time and money would be saved by adopting my solution.<br><br>
We live in a changing society. Values are always being challenged now, but I think that where tradition is good where tradition is valued and where tradition cannot be replaced, we ought to think very seriously before destroying it. I ask the Minister to consider this non-party point. It is a non-party matter in Norwich; it is a non-party matter in Bristol. Bristol has made great sacrifices in local government reorganisation. We are being stripped of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0589">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1083</span>
most of the powers which have been exercised so well for years. I ask the Minister not to subject us to the humiliation of having to go cap in hand for a charter which we have had for 600 years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that I am the only other Member with a city that is comparable to Bristol. Kingston upon Hull is a very ancient foundation. When I hear my hon. Friend talking about Edmund Burke I add that we have names such as William Wilberforce, Andrew Marvell and many others. We had a distinguished period of fighting in the Civil War from 1642 to 1649. Hull today is well known, not least for my colleagues and myself and the divided borough. We have a dignified past, just as Bristol has. I echo all the factual statements made on behalf of his ancient city by my hon. Friend. I could add to these statements, but since the night is now wearing on I shall content myself by saying that I am wholly in favour of any Amendment of this nature.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denis Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope the Minister will be accommodating in respect of the Amendment and the next series of Amendments. They raise matters of considerable concern to most of our large cities at the present time.<br><br>
Coming as I do from Birmingham, I cannot compete with the historical evidence provided by my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South (Mr. Michael Cocks) and my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. James Johnson), but they would be the last people to suggest that our contemporary history is not as illustrious as their own more ancient history. One does not wish to bandy names about, but in terms of modern municipal government Chamberlain is a hallowed name in this place, as it is in the annals of local government generally. When one looks at Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield and other great cities, as well as the more modest-sized but more ancient cities, one can begin to understand the amount of civic feeling that exists on this matter.<br><br>
I assume that the Government would not wish to do anything to stop these cities from enjoying their ancient rights and privileges, especially if citizens take a pride in that situation. Whatever view we may take about the representation on boundaries and powers, for example, there is a great deal of evidence that the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1084</span>
citizens are taking a much keener interest in the Bill and its application to their local authorities than they take in most Bills that come before us.<br><br>
5.15 p.m.<br><br>
Getting people to serve on local authorities, building up a tradition of service and a tradition of standards of Government and local government, is, as we all know, a long and arduous process. Many cities feel strongly about the treatment they receive under the Bill. One would not wish to press that view too far, but that would be common ground. Whether one supports the Government's two-tier proposals or whether one supports the unitary principle, it is common ground that some sore feeling exists across the parties throughout the country. One way to show that any changes we are making are not to the detriment of the status and standing of existing cities would be to adopt the Amendment and also the next series of Amendments.<br><br>
In those circumstances, I cannot see why it is not possible for the charters and the style of our cities to be automatically carried on under these changing arrangements. I beg the Minister to appreciate that it is giving considerable concern to our cities that this automatic translation of the old into the new is not apparently happening under the Bill as it is.<br><br>
On the principle, no-one can see any argument against it. Indeed, the Government themselves, by virtually encouraging all cities to apply immediately for borough status and for the granting of a new charter, acknowledge that this ought to be possible. Therefore, it cannot be an argument of principle between us, but just the pure mechanics of doing it.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South made a compelling point when he said that to have held this charter for 600 years and then to have to apply again to be reinstated is to add insult to the injury which many of these cities feel they are now suffering. I hope therefore, that, on reflection, the Minister will decide that this Amendment, or at any rate something like it, is desirable and practicable, because we shall need a lot of convincing that it ought not to be accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if the Clause could give offence, as the hon. Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) put it, or that it would create any
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0590">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1085</span>
sense of humiliation—the word used by the hon. Member for Bristol, South (Mr. Michael Cocks). Indeed, if one of our great cities applies for a revision of its charter—and this is really all that is happening here—it still holds the ancient charter, as it always has done and, frankly, I cannot see that it is humiliating to apply for the petition that it will require under the new local government structure.<br><br>
Let me first deal with the matter theoretically. In the Bill we are destroying certain existing local governments and their areas, and in those circumstances there is no area to which any charter applies. There is no local authority to which any existing charter applies.<br><br>
We have endeavoured by subsection (5) to give as much continuity as possible. The whole machinery of the Clause overcomes many of the difficulties of continuity. For example, in certain areas we may have more than one borough: there may be two or three boroughs in one district. Somebody must choose which charter is to continue there if, as the Amendment desires, an existing charter continues. Indeed, it would not be possible to continue the charter of one borough in a district where there were already three or four boroughs, all having their own charters. The new district must have its new charter. The machinery we have suggested in the Clause would overcome that sort of difficulty.<br><br>
I appreciate the feeling behind the speeches which have been made on this Amendment and, although I think that our machinery would overcome the difficulty of several boroughs in one district, would overcome the difficulties of certain ancient powers or responsibilities, honours or privileges which a new district might want to have revised in some way, I should like to meet the point which has been put forward in this Amendment.<br><br>
If we are dealing in a new district with an area which is for all purposes the same as the area which already holds a charter—for example, we can see that Bristol itself, with its existing boundaries, even if they may be pushed a parish here or a parish there, is really the old Bristol with its charter, and we can see that the new district of Norwich is the old Norwich City—I cannot see any reason why we should not make provision in the Bill for that. I am speaking without any authority from the draftsmen of the Bill, trying to think of a reasonable way to meet these matters.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1086</span>
I have just had put in front of me the name of Plymouth. There, again, perhaps we can satisfy the aspirations of a city.<br><br>
I should like to see whether we can give Her Majesty a discretion to continue a charter where this is practical, rather than issue a new charter. I suppose one could have a petition for the continuation of a charter, as much as one could have a petition for a new charter. This would not apply if the boundaries of the district were not coincident with the boundaries of the city which already held the charter. We should have new charters then, so we shall disappoint some of the smaller boroughs which will have to surrender their charters for a charter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am loth to interrupt the Minister when he is making such an accommodating speech, which we appreciate, but I am not quite certain that he carries us all the way with him. I well understand that if the new boundaries are almost exactly the same as the old ones, what the Minister has said is absolutely satisfactory to all of us. But I should like him just to go one step further. I have Birmingham in mind, where Sutton Coldfield, only three more wards, is being added. If there were an argument about it the Minister would be right. He would say that there were two authorities here and that a new charter must be applied for. But if the people from Sutton—which is only a small addition to Birmingham—were satisfied that the Birmingham charter ought to be renewed, I hope that where there was agreement the hon. Gentleman would be happy to concur.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. The hon. Gentleman is driving me too far. If there are two different areas and part has a charter at the moment, I will not say that Birmingham must call itself the Borough of Sutton Coldfield, with the Sutton Coldfield charter. I am quite sure that I already have a machine-gun in my back from the parliamentary draftsman who is sitting behind me. I do not want to have it from Birmingham as well.<br><br>
I think that I have gone as far as I can to meet the reasonable aspirations of those who wish to continue the existing charter.<br><br>
I believe that there is some form in which they can petition Her Majesty to continue their charter rather than petition Her
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0591">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1087</span>
Majesty to create an entirely new one. If the Committee will let me look at this question between now and Report, I shall be happy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to seem to have touched the Minister on a sore spot—we shall be very happy to leave it for him to think about again—but I assure him that, if I come back to the case of Birmingham, he certainly will have his friends from Birmingham coming down with machine-guns, if he says they are to be an exception to what has been, if I may say so, a magnanimous concession to other cities.<br><br>
When it is a case of an addition of one small borough to a major borough, I agree with the Minister that, if this were a matter of argument, this in logic would be right. All I am asking him to do is, where there is agreement in such cases to the continuation of one charter out of the alternatives, in those circumstances, too, he would consider the situation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has been extremely generous in the way in which he has gone to meet the point made by my hon. Friend for Bristol, South (Mr. Michael Cocks). I am, however, a little concerned about one implication in what he has said and the way it may be taken either by the Boundary Commission or by local authorities drawing up districting patterns.<br><br>
It may be that, if local authorities feel that they will be able to maintain their charter if the new district is identical with the existing district, they will press for certain districting patterns within the new counties which might not be optimal ones for the new pattern of local government. I hope that, in order to avoid any danger of that sort and our ending up with districts which might be able to preserve old charters but might not necessarily be the right districts for the future of local government, the Minister will clarify very soon what he has said today in order that there can be no misconception in the country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This Clause merely deals with the dignities of the areas; it does not deal with their functions or their boundaries. I should hate to think that any suggestion I have made by way of concession to the larger cities would cause any friction in any other way, or cause an altera-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1088</span>
tion in the basis of the Bill and the boundaries which will be found to be right from the local government point of view.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is being accommodating on this matter and, incidentally, to do this, where there is an existing borough which retains its boundaries almost intact, and would then be called a borough again, would to a considerable extent reduce the log-jam of the authorities which will be petitioning. It would be a way of cutting them down but, distinguished though the Minister of State's record is, and his experience at the Minstry of the Environment and with regard to councils and borough councils, it is obvious from what he has just been saying to the Committee that there is one position he has never held—he has never been a mayor.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank God!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He has no idea of the implications of what he has just said to the Committee in respect of mayors and mayors' attendants. He has no idea of the mud which he has stirred by the speech which he has just made. Boroughs are not rated by their size but by the age of their charters and, therefore, the precedence of the mayors, so some of the greatest cities in the land come way behind some quite small authorities whose charters go back much further.<br><br>
If a mayor happens to forget that, I can assure you Sir, Stephen, that his attendant never forgets it. I have been there, and my attendant would fight to see that I had the right place in the queue, whether it was ahead of Ellesmere Port or slightly behind Liverpool, and so on. That is for quite a small authority, because it is on age and length of charter that precedence is determined when mayors get together—a "nest of mayors" is the normal collective noun, I believe.<br><br>
This will allow some places whose boundaries remain intact to keep their charters of 1200 A.D. and 1400 A.D., while another authority, which possibly was more ancient, would have a charter dating from 1974—the newest of new boys. It will not go down very well with mayors, and even less with mayors' attendants.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If he presses me any further, I shall withdraw all the concessions I have made. I can see that what I have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0592">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1089</span>
said is causing great friction, and that is the last thing I wanted. May I defend myself. I know that genius skips a generation, but my father was a mayor, my grandfather was a mayor, and I think my great-grandfather was, too.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cocks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise hastily lest any more of my hon. Friends speak. I should like to thank the Minister most sincerely for recognising the position of cities like Norwich and Bristol, and for undertaking that he will try and reach some form of accommodation. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p>5.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cocks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 200, in page 3, line 11, after "privileges" insert
<br><blockquote><p>"including the title of city and the offices of lord mayor and sheriff."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this Amendment we are to take the following:</span></p>
<p>Amendment No. 201, in page 3, line 27, at end insert "or city".</p>
<p>Amendment No. 202, in page 3, line 29, after "mayor", insert "or lord mayor".</p>
<p>Amendment No. 203, in page 3, line 30, after "mayor", insert "or deputy lord mayor".</p>
<p>Amendment No. 204, in page 3, line 31, after "mayor", insert "or lord mayor".</p>
<p>Amendment No. 380, in page 3, line 31, after "borough", insert "or city".</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cocks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These Amendments would build into the Bill the style of deputy lord mayor, lord mayor and sheriff, rather than leaving them unspecified. I am sure the Minister will appreciate that the authorities which already have these offices are most anxious that they should continue, and will be reassured to have them written into the Bill so that they may have that continuity. The Minister, with his antecedents and experience, will have appreciated how these titles are respected and sought after in the best sense; and how the people in these offices fulfil useful functions. I know from his response to the last Amendment that he understands the motivation behind this series of Amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I join with my hon. Friend in hoping that the Minister will
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1090</span>
find it possible to accept this series of Amendments, or will give us an undertaking that it meets with his approval. We are here discussing the style of our great cities of this country in terms of their economic importance and the weight of numbers; not just Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool, which I mentioned before, but Leeds, Sheffield, Nottingham, Leicester, Newcastle, Plymouth. These cities attach tremendous importance to being called cities, and to the fact that their first citizen is known as the lord mayor. It is this which is at stake here, and on which we are pressing the Minister.<br><br>
I am sure that the Minister will concede—because I do not think any Minister in modern times possibly has visited more of the cities than the Minister of State and his colleague—that wherever he has gone, or whatever the outcome of these discussions, he has been impressed by the tremendous interest and enthusiam which goes into local government, and the importance which those who serve local authorities attach to the status and style of their city and to the style and title of its chief citizen. It would be regarded by all our great cities as a grievous blow if they were not to be known as cities and if their first citizens were not to be called lord mayors.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can give a guarantee on this point without the Amendments. I am advised that the Amendments are unnecessary. Things like this can be taken into account in the charters when the district applies for the charter, and are included in the words in Clause 3(1,<i>b</i>), in which it is said that:
<br><blockquote><p>"Her Majesty may …
<ol>
<li>provide for the preservation of any special provisions included in earlier charters and the application to the borough of special privileges otherwise enjoyed …"</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
Those words, I am advised, will cover such privileges as may appear in previous charters.<br><br>
But there is a practice, which has been adopted by Her Majesty on the advice of the Privy Counci, to grant the titles of "city" and "lord mayor" in letters patent. I should not like to try to explain to the Committee why it is done in letters patent instead of charter, but that is the practice. I am sure that there will be no difficulty whatever in preserving these offices and the titles to them. We have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0593">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1091</span>
innumerable offices over the country: stewards in some cities, sheriffs—of Nottingham, as well as others; the Remembrancer, and various titles of that sort, which are preserved either in charters or in letters patent. This will follow from Clause 3. To use a phrase that has been used several times in this Committee, I have taken this aboard. I do not think that we need these Amendments, and I ask for them to be withdrawn.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cocks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the Minister's wholly satisfactory response, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this Amendment we can take Amendment No. 477, in Clause 16, page 9, line 5, leave out from "councillors" to the end of subsection (1).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend said this morning that various Amendments coming before the Committee on various questions can be divided into "Yes" questions and "Yes-ish" questions. This is a "Yes" question, and what I am attempting is to say that the chairman of a district or county council shall be a member of that authority duly democratically elected by the people. This seems to be absolute common sense.<br><br>
I was a little encouraged by what the Under-Secretary said this morning when he was talking about aldermen. He made the very point that it was better that aldermen were members of the authority, because it would be wrong to allow aldermen to come in who were not members of the authority. If it is wrong for aldermen not to be members duly elected of the authority, how much worse it is for a man to be unelected and yet appointed by the council to be its mayor or chairman, whether it be a county or a district council.<br><br>
There are all sorts of problems, I know, about a man being elected to the chair. The Government spokesman will probably say that it is possible that a man may
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1092</span>
have given many years of service to his council, and then, for some reason, he loses the election immediately before his turn comes to become its chairman and that, to allow for such cases, it is necessary to provide for a person other than a councillor to be made chairman.<br><br>
That is equally wrong. If a man is defeated at the elections when the public know that he is about to have the honour bestowed upon him of being chairman of the authority, he clearly should not be made chairman of that authority. The matter is determined, not merely by the voice of the councillors but by the voice of the people; the voice of the electorate.<br><br>
I can see no reason at all why this hangover from the 1933 Act and previous Acts should go on. The Bill in its present form permits a person who has never been elected at all, who has never submitted his name to the electorate, to be given the important office of chairman of a county or district council. I have praised the Government for their enlightenment in getting rid of aldermen, and I should now like them to go further in the process of democratising local government, by saying that if a person is to exercise authority as a councillor, no matter what the local authority may be, he shall be elected to that office. That is even more essential if the office is the very important office of chairman, giving him the casting vote.<br><br>
I hope that the Government will accept the Amendment and insist that, in future, any person who is a councillor or a chairman shall be elected to the office of a councillor by the people before he can occupy the office of the chair, and not allow an outsider, no matter how distinguished that outsider may be, to sit as chairman of a local authority body that ought to be a wholly democratic body.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) for putting down the Amendments. He anticipated my reply, pointing out that this is a continuation of existing practice. There has never been any pressure to change it. For that reason, the matter has not been ventilated perhaps as much as it should have been. In the light of the hon. Member's Amendment, and looking at the matter again, it would be impossible to defend the present position. Amendment No. 54 is totally right, and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0594">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1093</span>
I strongly advise the Committee to accept it. Amendment No. 54 deals with the chairmen of principal authorities, county and district authorities. It says, in effect, that nobody who is not elected to those councils can be chairmen. Perhaps the Committee will agree with the hon. Member, and perhaps with me, in saying that in the case of the principal authorities, counties and districts the position is quite untenable, and will therefore accept the Amendment.<br><br>
Amendment No. 477 deals with the identical position in parish councils. The case I put to the Committee is whether quite the same circumstances apply in parishes. One cannot doubt the logic of what the hon. Gentleman has said; that these are democratically-elected councils. One could argue that pure democratic theory demands that the chairman should be a member of that council, should be elected to the council, and that nobody who was not elected should be allowed to be chairman.<br><br>
The fact is that parish councils are not conducted in quite the same way as principal councils. Everyone will accept that reality.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if I looked amazed when the hon. Gentleman was talking. Amendment No. 477 is not my Amendment. My Amendment relates only to principal councils. That is why I looked somewhat startled when he spoke about the other Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Amendments are being taken together. What the hon. Member for Widnes says is perfectly true. I am in something of a difficulty because the case has not been put, and I am replying to it. The Committee may feel that, in the cases of parishes, it would be reasonable to continue the existing situation.<br><br>
The argument is advocated strongly by the National Association of Parish Councils. I will read to the Committee the letter which was sent to us on 20th January, and hon. Gentlemen will realise why the parish councils feel as they do. They say that the matter
<br><blockquote><p>"… has been exhaustively and recently discussed in this Association, and we have always concluded that in the circumstances of village life the very limited power of co-option entailed in the right to appoint an outside chairman can be exceedingly useful. It arises particularly where there is a local public personality whom everyone wants"—</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1094</span>
—this is what the Association says; I am quite open-minded:
<br><blockquote><p>"on the parish council, but who has good reasons, with which everyone equally agrees, that he should not stand <i>against</i> anyone at an election. A practical example is a personally respected Methodist minister in a parish with a large Anglican adherence."</p></blockquote>
5.45 p.m.<br><br>
That is the point put by the association. One could expand on that sort of argument considerably, and it is for this Committee to discuss, if it wishes, whether we should accept the validity of these arguments and, therefore, ask the hon. Member who put down Amendment No. 477 to withdraw it, or whether we should pursue the matter further.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for the concession he gave in the first part of his remarks. My hon. Friend the Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) was quite right in saying that it would be wrong in this day and age for a non-elected person to be chosen as the chairman of an authority.<br><br>
Then we move on to the other Amendment, about which the Under-Secretary told us he had representations. We have been discussing among ourselves the content of that letter which we had not known about before and which the Minister rightly read out to us. I hope that he will not mind my saying that what is involved here is the squire and his relations.<br><br>
It is all very well for the Association of Parish Councils to talk to us about a Methodist minister in a predominantly Anglican area, or, presumably, a Roman Catholic or some other minister of a minority religion, or any other respected public personality, but so often in the rural areas there are tremendous pressures on small councils from the landowners and squirearchy—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patrick Cormack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would give one or two specific examples from his own deep knowledge and experience of rural areas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an example of my reasons for never wanting to give way to the hon. Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack) again—Hon. Members: "Oh".]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must make the point to the Committee that so long as I am in the Chair I will not tolerate
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0595">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1095</span>
for longer than I can possibly help interruptions from a sedentary position; they only delay our work and lead hon. Members off the subject they are discussing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Sir Stephen. Perhaps I can leave the matter there, and ask the hon. Member to appreciate that although all one's experience is in the city, anybody who for 20 years has been concerned with local government and has been official Government spokesman for about ten years of that time really has had experience outside' his own cabbage patch. If the hon. Member appreciated that fact we could have more respect for each other.<br><br>
When I go around the country, as I often do, on party political activities I find, particularly in the south-west and the west that there is a real sense of the difficulty of getting people even to stand for election to authorities, because the last remnants of the feudal system still exist. This is what worries me about the Under-Secretary's proposition.<br><br>
I agree that the letter from the Association of Parish Councils sounds quite reasonable—it dresses up its examples in religious terminology—but the Opposition know that the real fight here is in respect of people who have economic power and influence but who do not intend to stand for election. I suppose we have to decide whether we vote on this when we come to Clause 16. We believe that parish councils or neighbourhood councils or community councils ought to be more important in the future than they have been in the past.<br><br>
I do not believe that anybody can justify the assumption of the chairmanship of any one of these councils by anyone who has not offered himself to the electorate as a whole. People should have the opportunity of knowing what a man stands for, rather than having any strong and dominating personality, whoever he is, saying, "I, by divine right of my personality or local position, am entitled, without giving any views to the public, to assume the chairmanship of this council".<br><br>
That would be wrong and, much as I welcome the Minister's concession in respect of the Amendment, I hope that he will think it right to extend the principle even to parish councils. Unless we hear
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1096</span>
anything strongly to the contrary, I suggest that, when we reach Clause 16, my hon. Friends should register that opinion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before we get confused, I will explain the position to the Committee. As I understand it, Amendment No. 54 has been accepted by the Minister and has the general goodwill of the Committee. We need not debate that any further. Amendment No. 477 is being discussed in its reference to Clause 16, and we shall not vote on that until we reach Clause 16, but, when we do come to its position in the Notice Paper, when we reach Clause 16, we shall not, of course, be able to debate it. There will merely be a Division. Hon. Members must make up their minds whether they wish to continue the debate on Amendment No. 477 now, or whether they want the time between now and when we reach Clause 16 to make up their minds how they will vote. That is the position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cormack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend said that he would welcome a discussion on Amendment No. 477 and it would, therefore, be a good idea to have one, particularly in view of what the hon. Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) has just said. I was totally in agreement—I hope that it will not be out of order to say so—with the Amendment which the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) moved so eloquently and forcefully. I do not think that anyone could possibly dissent from the essentials of his argument. Equally, however, the argument advanced by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary was valid in respect of the smaller authorities. These are authorities which do not wield great power, although we are concerned that they should have great local influence. They represent, for the most part, small, closely integrated, closely knit communities where everybody knows everybody else.<br><br>
They are not bastions of feudal England. I do not know what part of England the hon. Member for Small Heath has in mind if he thinks that a feudal squirearchy still holds sway. We are talking of ordinary villages and parishes. There is nothing wrong in that sort of authority deciding that it wishes to honour a distinguished local servant, be he Anglican vicar, Methodist minister or anyone else—even a descendant of the former squire—

by appointing him to be chairman for a year or so. It is a signal mark of honour which is often very highly regarded, and it is not the function of this Committee to take that power from those areas.<br><br>
After all, for the past several weeks we have been debating Schedule 1 and, time and time again, I myself and hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have talked about local wishes. We have said how important it is to pay regard to local wishes. Almost all of us have advanced causes which we know intimately or on behalf of colleagues. Here, again, we are talking about local wishes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely one can differentiate between the wishes of a community in total about the institutions or about the margin of their local authority area. This is not, however, a decision of that kind; this is about personalities and sentiment. If the hon. Gentleman disbelieves that there are any squires about in counties like Yorkshire or Cornwall, will he cast his mind on the female of the species and think about the power that is wielded by the President of the Women's Institute and by those who consort with her? Even in Lincolnshire there is influence here.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cormack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be a highly dubious exercise for the Committee to indulge in discussions of the President of the Women's Institute and those who consort with her—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It would also be entirely out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. I do not want to stop the hon. Gentleman in full flow. At least, I do for another reason. It seems to me that the Under-Secretary's very fair point that this was a matter that needed consideration, and your very fair offer, Sir Stephen, to the Committee that we had the choice of debating it now or of debating it in context. on Clause 16, is something on which we ought to make up our minds. At the moment we are doing half and half. I should very much appreciate it if we had this absolutely in context in Clause 16, partly because I want time to consider it myself and I know the Under-Secretary does also, and partly because I think it right that it should be considered then rather than now.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1098</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should very much like to have been able to agree with the hon. Gentleman that we could debate this point again on Clause 16. But, in fact, we cannot. We have this Amendment; we can divide on it when we get to Clause 16, but we cannot at that time debate it. Therefore, I was suggesting that as it is obvious that some hon. Members have different views about it, and as the Minister himself has said that he would like to think about it, I thought it might be a good idea if, between now and the debate on the "Clause stand part", hon. Members, having used that time for research and having thought about it, were able to exercise their votes intelligently when we reach the right stage on the Paper.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. I fully understand your ruling, Sir Stephen, but that would preclude hon. Members from the opportunity to think before speaking, which I think was the point the right hon. Member had in mind! Would it be in order for the right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin), to withdraw the Amendment? Then perhaps if a vaguely similar Amendment appeared in Clause 16, further debate might be possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cormack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Stephen. Would it be in order for me to finish my speech?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The best way to get over the difficulty is by getting the consent of the Committee. We have embarked on a discussion on Amendment No. 54 with which we have taken Amendment No. 477. If it is the will of the Committee that we should take Amendment No. 54 and the hon. Gentleman is willing to withdraw his Amendment No. 477, or postpone its consideration until Clause 16, that would be the best way of getting over it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Since the Amendment does not stand in my name, can I do that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is quite in order.</span></p>

<p>6.0 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to say that the helpful attitude of the Under-Secretary and the Minister in the last two discussions has meant that I do not again have to go through the whole of the discussions about the importance of having chairmen who are actually members of the authority. I will confess at once to the Minister that that argument was part of the reason for putting this Amendment down.<br><br>
It is our experience—and I am advised bye minent local government advisers—that there have been one or two extremely unfortunate incidents around the country where last-minute nominations have been thrust upon local authorities for various reasons, which has unsettled and disturbed the local authority for a period. There is nothing which concerns local authority members more than the proper rotation of the chairmanship, the acceptance of which is in most authorities the highest honour which a citizen can have, certainly the highest honour which a member of a local authority can have bestowed upon him—namely, becoming the mayor or the chairman of his county borough or his district council. The question arises as to how this can best be brought about.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1100</span>
When we were giving consideration to this Bill, it seemed proper to us that there should be nominations in writing by two members of the authority in advance of the day on which the election of the chairman or the vice-chairman was going to be held. All the members of the authority would have the opportunity to give adequate consideration—the point very properly put by you, Sir Stephen, a moment ago in another context—the opportunity of thinking before voting. This is what we are asking for in respect of the appointment of chairman and vice-chairman of the various authorities.<br><br>
The practice which we have outlined here, and the method by which such a vote should be conducted, was invariably the practice which was used in the election of aldermen under the old system in most of our cities. The Under-Secretary will be able to tell us whether it is enshrined in the law. People wrote on a piece of paper the name of the candidate whom they supported, and handed it to the chairman of the council. We adopted this procedure because it seemed to be time-hallowed.<br><br>
The main point of principle is that in the conduct of our main authorities it is reasonable, when electing the chairman of that authority, or the mayor or lord mayor, that adequate notice should be given, to enable the council to take stock of the situation. In my experience, in most of our authorities, this sort of thing is done by agreement between the parties. Invariably the custom is that, well before the day of the election, the members of the authority have decided between themselves which of their number they wish to honour by electing as the chairman, the mayor or the lord mayor. It becomes almost a ceremonial occasion, when members of opposite political parties propose the mayor or chairman. That is something which we should all welcome, in view of the impartial, non-party position which the chairman or the mayor takes up for the year of his office in most authorities.<br><br>
There have been, as I say, one or two unfortunate experiences, which have clouded the local government scene for quite a time afterwards. It is in respect of those that we seek to obtain the thinking of Government. This is not the sort of Amendment that I should advise my hon. Friends to go to the stake for, but it is worth airing in the Committee. The Government may think it proper to write some such machinery into the Bill, or at
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0598">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1101</span>
least to consider it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the arguments put forward by the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) have a great deal of strength and are based on much research into the way in which this could be dealt with. He has produced a scheme which I do not want to talk about in great detail, because my arguments will be centred elsewhere. Anything that I say is no reflection upon his scheme. In this case I do not think that the scheme, and its details, are the essence of the Government's case.<br><br>
One of the arguments put forward by hon. Members opposite is that this is a Bill without philosophy. My personal guess is that no local government reform Bill would ever contain the sort of philosophy that could be so described, because one is dealing with such a range of difficult decisions. If there is a philosophy, it has been that throughout we have tried wherever possible to take the pressure of central Government off the backs of the local authorities. Speeches have been made, which are totally accurate, that we had on our desks when we first started looking at this matter. I am sure hon. Members opposite will remember the same sort of exercise being done when they were in power—a schedule of no fewer than 1,000 powers of central Government over local government. There was page after page of reference, check and control that had to be made by local authorities to central Government.<br><br>
We therefore made up our minds that wherever possible we would claw through this schedule and eliminate whatever controls we humanly could. We recognised the fact that the authorities which we are talking about will be large, powerful and rich and that the best way to make them responsible is to give them the maximum degree of freedom.<br><br>
It was either Lloyd George or Gladstone who said that nothing befits a man for freedom so much as freedom itself. This is the philosophy that we would bring to bear on issues of this sort. I dare say there have been occasions when the non-existence of a framework has led to examples of abuse, but my information is that the numbers of such occasions are few and far between.<br><br>
One could go through local government reform with the determination to tidy up
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1102</span>
every possible loophole so that there is absolutely nothing under any circumstances that local elected representatives could do. I should have thought that we ought to avoid that particular temptation, and we, as a Government, have certainly been absolutely determined not to take powers unto ourselves which do not exist this moment and, indeed, to find powers which do exist and to remove them.<br><br>
Looking at the Amendment on that basis, we felt that, however practically sensible it may be in itself, it would be wrong to impose a statutory control for the first time—for it certainly does not exist in the 1933 Act—on authorities which everyone agrees will be larger and more responsible. I put this forward as being the main argument which I think important. I very much hope that the hon. Member for Small Heath will feel, on reflection, in the light of what we believe that these authorities will be, that it is not necessary to press the argument and that, on this very important matter, where most of them have always found it perfectly possible to come to agreement, we should not proceed to put controls on them.<br><br>
Under the legislation there is ample opportunity for the local authorities to set out under their own standing orders their provisions for the election of chairmen and I have no doubt that they will act as responsible bodies in so doing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to make two small observations before I seek leave to withdraw the Amendment. The first, as my right hon. Friend said to me, is that freedom is often helped when the users of freedom have clearly before them the rules in which freedom cart be exercised. That seems to me an impeccable sentiment. However, I am aware, as I said when I moved this Amendment, that the most important part of our thinking was that we did not want people from outside brought on to the local authorities as chairmen. That has been conceded by the Under-Secretary.<br><br>
The second part of the argument to which I was going to address myself was that people from outside certainly ought not to be brought in at the last minute. As the first part of the argument has been conceded, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Basically, this Amendment, together with the related Amendments that follow, would assimilate the holding of elections throughout county councils, district councils and parish councils, and would do it on the basis of a two-year election system. The Under-Secretary and the Minister have been so busy this afternoon—and, indeed, this morning—handing out goodies to the Opposition and their own side by the acceptance of Amendments or promises to look at them favourably, that I have a horrid suspicion that the Minister of State, Home Office, has been infected by this and may give me what I want. That is the last thing that I want at this moment; I want to put it to the Minister that this system of elections for local government under the new scheme has not been thought out properly.<br><br>
I can understand that there might be some Government objection to that statement. They may say that they have looked hard at it; that they are following precedents, and so on. It is not quite what I mean. There is a totally new system of local government. I realise that time is relatively short—although I imagine that it could be done in the very near future—but I should like the Minister of State to call together the representatives of the political parties and ascertain their views.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1104</span>
I do not believe that it is done. There cannot be a partisan political point on this question. It is something on which the organisers and activists in all the political parties would have roughly the same views—the convenience to them in holding elections, and the proper way in which they should be organised.<br><br>
In case anyone should say, "Are you not handing over local government to the party machine?" my answer is a slightly hollow laugh—because we all know that party machines have the question of local government very much in mind, and that all political parties grow, become active and continue in their work because of those who are interested in local government. It is the engine that drives the machine.<br><br>
I imagine that there is also common ground between the two sides of the Committee, as there has been on many occasions today, on the need for a vigorous local democracy, and not just vigorous local government. We would probably all accept that it is mainly through political parties that our local democracy—like our central democracy—is run.<br><br>
I do not wish to repeat myself. I have been giving the Minister of State time to remember whether or not he consulted the political parties. If he searches his mind he will probably find that if there has been any consultation it has been at a very primitive level.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What is primitive?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Primitive means, "These are my ideas. Go away", and that is that. Sophisticated means, "What are your ideas?" If the Minister of State will take to heart what I say and give me some assurance it will be with overwhelming relief that I shall beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Richard Sharples)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can put the right hon. Gentleman out of his misery straight away. First, it is not my intention to advise the Committee to accept the Amendments. Secondly, I will respond to the point that he has raised. On the question of consultation, some of the proposals contained in the Amendments were put forward by the Labour Party in consultations. There was full consultation with the political parties at professional level.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the Minister of State may have been so advised. Will he look into the point again? He is not committing himself very much if he says that. That was not the advice that I received.</span></p>
<p>6.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sharples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, I will look into it again. But I can say now that although there was nothing in the form of a round-table discussion, our proposals were circulated confidentially to the political parties.<br><br>
They were also circulated to other bodies. In proposing a system of election of this kind we have to take into account not only the views of the political parties, which are very important, but also the views of the various other affected bodies.<br><br>
I can assure the right hon. Member that we are not dogmatic about this. We all have the same objective in mind. I use the words used by the right hon. Gentleman. What we want is a vigorous local democracy, and our objective is to try, by a system of having some form of local government election every year, to increase the participation of ordinary people—the electors—in local government.<br><br>
I do not know whether the solution that we have put forward, after a great deal of consideration, is the ideal one. I do not think that any solution would be ideal, but I can assure the right hon. Gentleman that we have given full consideration to the point. If he feels that his party, the Liberal Party, or any other party, would like to come forward with other proposals and suggestions, I should certainly give those proposals full consideration.<br><br>
I accept what the right hon. Gentleman has said in the constructive sense in which it was put forward. But our present view, having considered at great length all the alternative suggestions put forward by the professional elements in the various political parties, and the comments put forward on the scheme by the various outside bodies—for example, the local authority associations—is that the scheme that we are now putting forward offers the best solution.<br><br>
The scheme contained in the Amendments was put forward, broadly speaking, by the Labour Party at the time. From what he said, I think that the right hon. Gentleman recognises that there are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1106</span>
considerable defects in it, but as he is not pressing me to accept the Amendments I do not want to go into all the arguments again. I shall consider what he has said very carefully. Perhaps we can have a talk about it later. But I cannot advise the Committee to accept the Amendments as they stand.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister of State will not mind my saying that the Clause involves considerable principles which are entirely new in our local government system. Two principles have never before applied in local government service. The first is that a local authority councillor shall be elected for a period of four instead of three years.<br><br>
The second, which is even more important—indeed, it would justify a lengthy discussion, though I do not intend to embark upon one—is the proposition that when we deal with metropolitan areas, for example, one councillor shall for four years represent a constituency of a considerable size, and shall do so as a voluntary individual.<br><br>
I am sorry to return to the subject of Birmingham—I am sure it is true of other large cities—but we now have the Home Office proposals for the ward boundaries in that city and the size of constituency that people will represent on the metropolitan authority. The Home Office proposes that for metropolitan areas in the West Midlands one councillor shall represent over 20,000 people, and shall do so as a voluntary individual, earning his living in industry or commerce.<br><br>
He may have to travel considerable distances to do so. For example, if the headquarters are in Birmingham, some people will have to come in from Wolverhampton and Coventry.<br><br>
That is a considerable new principle, the practicalities of which cause me some concern. I say, in passing, that Conservative Members go into print asking how they can find people who are prepared to give time on a voluntary basis in these new metropolitan areas. I say this in order to illustrate the importance of the principle of the Clause.<br><br>
In those circumstances, having four-year periods of office with a single representative only in the metropolitan areas, one would have thought that there would be a maximum consultation with the political parties. I am astounded that the Minister of State cannot tell us more defi-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0601">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1107</span>
nitely about the processes of consultation that have been embarked upon. I am advised that there is an institution known as the Home Office advisory committee or the Home Secretary's advisory committee. The best way of explaining what that committee is supposed to do is to say that it forms the other channels operating in the sphere of electoral influence in the Home Office, dealing with all those things that people with legitimate party interests to project can project and dispose of, and reach sensible conclusions.<br><br>
The system is probably difficult to justify by logic, but it works, and it enables the political parties to say, for example, that it is asking a lot of a man to represent 20,000 people for four years, on his own, when in respect of the district councils for exactly the same size of ward, of 20,000 people, there are three councillors. That is the issue.<br><br>
As my right hon. Friend said, we are not asking the Minister to pronounce on this matter today, but we thought it odd that the calling together of the Home Secretary's committee had not taken place. It may well be that there ought to be more mature thinking about the size of constituencies, and the whole question of the optimum level of representation, or the work load one can put on a local authority councillor in any of the new metropolitan areas. We ought to consider what is the optimum work load that we can expect any such man to carry on a voluntary basis, having regard to the distances that he has to travel to committee and subcommittee meetings.<br><br>
We think that this is a proper object of discussion between the parties and anybody else with a legitimate interest. I am not so arrogant as to suggest that only the political parties have an interest. There may well be other people. We hope that the Minister will give fresh thought to the matter. I agree with my right hon. Friend that there are no party politics here. We are concerned purely with the mechanics of politics, and I would have thought that the three main political parties would reach a similar decision as to the load that could be put on one man, the period of duration of office, and so on.<br><br>
That is all I have to say. I hope that the Minister will be able to tell us a little more about the Home Secretary's consultative committee, and the possibility of calling it together so that he and his offi-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1108</span>
cials can consult the parties and other interested people. It may then be possible to return to this at a later stage—although we all hope that agreement will be reached and that that course will not be necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sharples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member referred to the electoral advisory conference which, as I am sure he realises, is concerned with parliamentary election arrangements and not with local government elections. What has happened in this case is that the proposals were circulated to the various interested parties.<br><br>
The Labour Party accepted the idea of the four-year term, as do the Amendments. The Amendments also accept the principle of having elections in each district every other year, although they do not quite work out like that.<br><br>
The other point that was accepted was the idea of having one councillor representing each area. That was accepted in the terms of the Amendments. That may place a heavy burden on the individual county councillor, but the alternative is to have so many councillors on a county council as to make it an unwieldy body.<br><br>
As I say, the proposal in the Amendments is for an election of half the county council every two years. That means that there would be two county councillors representing a very large area—say, of 40,000 as compared with the one of 20,000 mentioned by the hon. Member for Small Heath—and having the campaign over that whole area. In my opinion and that of the interested parties that would be too large an area.<br><br>
Full consultation took place, at professional level, between the various interested parties. If it is felt that a better solution can be found I shall certainly consider it, but I have not seen one yet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept what the Minister of State has said, in the spirit in which he has said it, because I have made my point, namely, that some form of consultation ought to take place again. I did not really want the Minister to try to justify the Government's case at this moment, any more than I wanted to justify the Amendments—as he is well aware. I merely thought that there ought to be some process of consultation, and I was suggesting it to him by the only means I know—by putting down an Amendment.<br><br>
It seems quite appropriate to have an
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0602">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1109</span>
electoral advisory committee concerned with Parliamentary elections and not to have the same sort of system where local government continues year after year, unreorganised. There must be a better word than that. I mean where there has been no reorganisation of local government.<br><br>
But we are dealing with the reorganisation of local government, and it would be better—I am not teaching the Minister of State his job, but merely thinking aloud—to get all the interested parties together and, by a scratching of collective rather than individual heads in reply to letters asking for views, to reach the best possible answer in the circumstances.<br><br>
As I said earlier, I accept the Minister's good will. I think that he warns exactly the same thing that I want—a viable system of local government. Having raised the matter, I am content to leave it in his hands. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>

ELECTORAL DIVISIONS AND WARDS</div> <!-- title -->
<p>6.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 72, in page 5, leave out lines 22 and 23 and insert:
<br><blockquote><p>(<i>b</i>) every district shall be divided into wards each returning three councillors provided that in rural districts where geographical considerations make this impracticable wards returning only one councillor may be established and provided that the ratio of electors to each councillor shall be as near as practicable the same throughout the district.</p></blockquote>
In Committee one must be careful about saying certain things. I recall that I started this afternoon's Sitting by criticising the elegance of language of a certain part of the Bill. I now find that there is an Amendment, in my name, expressed in language the elegance and clarity of which by no means satisfy me. I shall try to explain to the Committee the purpose of the Amendment. Subsection (b) provides that
<br><blockquote><p>"every district shall be divided into wards, each returning a number of councillors which is divisible by three".</p></blockquote>
I am seeking to provide that at any one election only one councillor shall be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1110</span>
elected. Hon. Members who represent London constituencies do not have this problem, but some constituencies which return not one but two councillors. Under the Clause there is no limit; they can return two, three or even four councillors, or any number so long as it was divisible by three.<br><br>
That confuses the electorate. In a parliamentary election people are used to electing one Member. In 1948 we got rid of the dual borough system, whereby one borough elected two Members of Parliament. One reason was the confusion that existed in the minds of the electors; they had not one name to vote for, but one name from each of the two parties, and possibly from Independents, Liberals, and other parties intervening in the election.<br><br>
In wards where two members are elected—the hon. Member for Bolton, East (Mr. Laurance Reed) will know that this takes place in a number of wards in Bolton—the electors are confused. What happens is that they often carry on the same tradition at parliamentary elections, and vote for two candidates, thus ruining their votes.<br><br>
I appreciate the difficulty of what I am proposing in terms of rural areas. If there are to be three councillors for a rural ward the boundaries of that ward, because of the sparseness of the population, might make no sense; the community of interest that should exist among people in a ward would be lost, because the ward itself would have to be very big to return three councillors, and there would have to be parity with other wards in the district otherwise there would be an undue weighting in terms of representation on rural councils as against more urban councils.<br><br>
Hence the inelegantly-worded proviso in the Amendment, which recognises the facts of the situation in areas where there are exceptional geographical conditions, where only one councillor would be elected because the population would not be sufficient to stand three.<br><br>
I am mainly concerned with towns which, in the past, have elected two or perhaps three members for a ward at an election. That is wrong. It confuses the electors.<br><br>
It would be much simpler if, at any given election concerning the county, only one councillor were elected for each district. I should like to hear the Government's views on the matter.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0603">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1111</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend's argument, at least as far as this may be termed a probing Amendment. He has drawn modest attention to the inelegance of the language—a modesty which is perhaps not real, because he did not draft the Amendment and need not reproach himself.<br><br>
My hon. Friend has expressed clearly and adequately the basis of the Amendment, which is that we would like to have a single member representing a ward, just as we have a single Member representing a constituency in Parliament. At one time there were some two-Member constituencies, but that was felt to be a wrong and confusing method of election. Since we are talking about the total reorganisation of local government the time has surely come to reconsider the position.<br><br>
My hon. Friend and my right hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) are not alone in thinking as they do on the subject. This afternoon I had a letter from the County Councils Association saying that it supports the Amendment.<br><br>
Having looked at the Amendment maturely and reconsidering it, I have come come to the conclusion that it might be better not to complicate it—and this may reduce its inelegance—and simply to say that we should have a single-member ward, regardless of where it may be. The proviso is perhaps unnecessary, and too complicated. In any event, I think that the Minister of State, Home Office, understands the point, I do not want to labour it unduly at this stage. The point might apppropriately be dealt with by consultation, and perhaps considered well before Report, so that we can do something about it if necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Arthur Blenkinsop</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to intervene very briefly. Not only does the County Councils Association welcome the intention of the Amendment; I am assured that the Parish Councils Association does likewise. It says that there are real differences between what might be called urban areas and the wide stretches of countryside, and it feels that that point must be taken into account. My hon. Friend has sought to do that in the Amendment. Although the Parish Councils Association may have put alternative suggestions to the Ministry, it welcomes the broad intentions of the proposals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sharples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Amendments fall
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1112</span>
into two parts. The effect of the first part, as explained by the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes), would be to remove the possibility of having more than a three-member ward in any area. In future, wards with more than three members will in any case be very rare, but I wonder whether we should remove from the Bill the possibility of having such wards. There may be circumstances in which a six-member ward is needed.<br><br>
In the initial stage, and in the first election, it is almost certain that there will have to be a number of six-member wards. That would only be for the first election. It would add to the complexity of the Bill if we removed that possibility and had to make special provision for a certain kind of warding for the first elections. My advice on that point is that, on balance, it would be better to leave the Bill as it stands, although I think that in the majority of cases, and with very few exceptions, the three-member ward would be the right one. One-third of the councillors in each ward will be elected each year, except in every fourth year, when the county council elections take place. In county council elections only one candidate will be put forward by each political party.<br><br>
The second part of the Amendment is more controversial, because it goes against one of the principles of the Bill. The proposal is not that we should have for the country as a whole the position that we have in Parliament, with single Members representing constituencies.<br><br>
The proposal is that in certain areas where there are geographical difficulties—particularly in the more isolated rural areas—there should be the possibility of going against the system governing the remainder of the elections in the Bill, and of having single member wards. I can see the difficulty which the Amendments seek to overcome, namely, that in a very isolated area the members in a three-member ward, because of the small number of electors will represent a fairly large area. We must balance this against the disadvantage that if we were to accept the proposal put forward, in certain areas we would not have the annual election of somebody in local government.<br><br>
If we are to get more participation in local government it is important that the party machines should be kept in being, and that everyone in the country, in rural
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0604">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1113</span>
areas and elsewhere, should realise that each year, no matter where one lives, "Today is Local Government Election Day", and all should vote. We do not want a situation in which some vote and some do not, or in which some vote today and some not until another day. That is a fundamental principle, and that is why, after having given careful consideration to the point raised by the hon. Member for Widnes, I advise the Committee to leave the Bill as it stands in this respect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister has said, there are two points in the Amendment—one dealing with towns with multiple-member wards and the other with the country, where three councillors for a ward would make the ward so immense, if one had parity of numbers, that there would not be a community of interest in electing a local councillor for the area, because he could live in a village 10 or 12 miles away—or even further away in certain areas, such as Herefordshire.<br><br>
On the point made by the Minister of State on existing two-member wards, there are rather more of them about than he thinks. On his point that in certain circumstances there might be a need for a two-member ward, I thought that that was one of the reasons for the existence of a permanent Boundary Commission. It will be the duty not only of the local authority but also of the Boundary Commission to keep ward boundaries under constant review, so that there is some sanity in the size of a given ward.<br><br>
6.45 p.m.<br><br>
It is true that a ward could sometimes grow rapidly, or reduce rapidly, but under the present system that does not happen; it is often some of the smaller wards that return two councillors, while the bigger wards still return one, because of the hangover from the past, when the centre of the town was the most populous area. The Boundary Commission and local authorities—who should be ever vigilant about the size of their wards—should be able to rectify this position by making the necessary alterations from time to time, when they find that situation either existing or likely to exist because of their own planning proposals—for example, the reception of overspill in a certain area.<br><br>
On balance, I feel that it would be better to establish the principle followed in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1114</span>
Parliamentary elections, and as it will operate in county council elections, namely, the principle of electing only one man for one area.<br><br>
That would be far less confusing than allowing the Bill to leave loopholes for exemptions and exceptions, which ought to be cleared up by the Boundary Commission and the local authorities concerned. I ask the Minister of State to say that it may be better to create the principle of one councillor for one area—the same principle as in Parliamentary or county elections.<br><br>
There is a difficulty on the other point about rural areas. I appreciate what the Minister of State says—that there will be one polling day throughout the country instead of various polling days in a particular area, on any day from Monday to Saturday of a given week. All that will vanish, and there will be fixed polling times with the entire country going to the polls.<br><br>
If the Amendment were accepted it would mean that in a rural area one would vote only every three years, instead of every year. People are accustomed to that with county elections, where they vote once every four years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I point out to my hon. Friend that people would vote on the same day everywhere in the country only if there were enough candidates. That is not the situation at present.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. Unfortunately, in rural areas there is often only one man to fill the vacancy. Let us hope that when more interest is aroused, possibly by the passing of the Bill, elections will be contested. I am in favour of contested elections, as I know my hon. Friend is, because we know then that the electorate has been consulted and that whoever is returned is returned by verdict of the people, and it is not just a case of the perpetuation of the man who has been there for years and years because nobody has ever stood against him, or ever thought of standing against him.<br><br>
On balance, it would be better to give up the principle of an annual election in the rural areas for what I consider to be the far better principle of a community of interest of people together knowing that they represent one ward, rather than having either to elect three councillors—which they would have to do under the Bill—for an extremely large
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0605">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1115</span>
geographical area, where there would be so much remoteness that interest in the election might fall.<br><br>
That situation will arise in rural areas unless we are careful. The Amendment provides a way round it. I prefer to preserve that community of interest in the area by closing in the ward boundaries rather than having parity of councillors. We cannot have the rural tail wagging the urban dog, because that would be unfair. On the other hand, we cannot have the huge areas that could exist in certain counties—such as Cumbria, Northumberland, and Herefordshire—with the councillor concerned often living many miles away.<br><br>
I ask the Minister of State to think about this. I know that he is sympathetic to my point He has said that there could be exemptions, and I have answered by saying that the exceptions could be covered in another way. I ask him to reconsider the point between now and Report, in order to establish the principle, in the towns or the majority areas in the country, of each electoral area voting for one man, as they are accustomed to do, and in certain rural areas for the boundaries of wards to be sufficiently tight to create a feeling of community interest between voters of the area and the councillors whom they are electing to the district council.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sharples</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would not wish to be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1116</span>
dogmatic about anything in this field. We are all seeking the same objective—that as many people as possible should take part in local elections. We believe—and we have given much thought to the point—that the best way to proceed is by having everybody having the right to vote in a local election of some kind once a year. The proposal put forward by the hon. Gentleman breaches that principle. The idea may have some merit, but at this stage I can tell the Committee that I do not advise acceptance of the Amendment on those grounds. Between now and the Report I shall consider the matter, and anything that has been said, but at the moment I am firmly of the opinion that we should stick to the proposals contained in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that the Minister of State is not giving me any undertaking. Perhaps, between now and Report, both sides of the Committee can consider how to meet the problem. With that end in view, and knowing that the Minister has given me no commitment, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
