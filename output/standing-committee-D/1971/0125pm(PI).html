and Amendment No, 38, in page 189, column 2, line 29, leave out:
	<br><blockquote><p>"except the areas in Dorset".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Development (Mr. Graham Page)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have previously discussed the names of the counties. In this instance it is proposed to change "Dorset" to "Wessex". The new Dorset will include a number of important areas of Hampshire, including Bournemouth and Christchurch. It is presumably for this reason that the new name has been put forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>902</span>
A referendum amongst the local authorities concerned reveals a total of 10 authorities in favour of the name "Dorset", and five authorities in favour of the name "Wessex". One Member of Parliament favours the name "South Wessex". Thus on the score of local authorities alone—I have not taken account of population—"Dorset" has the majority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Presumably, the name "Wessex" was favoured by the new areas to be incorporated into the county. However, I imagine that Bournemouth at least is so used to being adjacent to Dorset and to being almost part of that county that it will not resent its future incorporation into a county of that name.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that the name "Wessex" is rather pretentious. In Bournemouth, for example, it attaches to a golf club, a tennis club, a bridge club, a building society and to Hardy's Wessex. However, I doubt whether that represents sufficient justification, and I hope that the Committee will be satisfied to agree to the name "Dorset". I recommend, therefore, that Amendment No. 111 should not be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The remaining Amendments in the group have not yet been discussed. Is it in order, Sir Stephen, for me to mention them, under the circumstances?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is open to any hon. Member of the Committee to discuss the Amendments. However, it might be more convenient for those hon. Gentlemen who have tabled them initially to put their points of view. Mr. King.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evelyn King</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I calculate that seven of the Amendments refer to Dorset, and I wish to say something about each of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is true that seven Amendments have been tabled affecting Dorset. Nevertheless, we are at present discussing only Amendments Nos. 111, 35, 372, 192 and 38. The other Amendments belong to the debate on Dorset and Wiltshire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. King</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are therefore discussing five Amendments, of which at least two appear in the name of the hon. and learned Member for Dulwich (Mr. S. C. Silkin), and refer to Lymington, Mere and Tisbury. I do not quite know from where the hon. and learned Member for Dulwich obtained his ideas. Perhaps he plucked them
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0493">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>903</span>
out of the sweet air of Dulwich, but I do not think they owe anything—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not want the hon. Member to lead us astray. He is referring to the hon. and learned Member for Dulwich (Mr. S. C. Silkin). I do not see his name to any of the Amendments. Does he mean the right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. King</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise. I found myself in Wiltshire and should have found myself in Hampshire. To return to Amendment No. 111 which affects Dorset, I am sure the decision given by my hon. Friend will be wholly acceptable. No one, certainly in the part of the country where I live, wishes the name to be changed. Both poetry and reality convince us that the name Dorset shall remain, and so I hope it shall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Schedule 1 we have wound our weary way through the geography of England. The number of local authorities which wish to enlarge their sphere of usefulness is substantial. I shall be breaking into fresh ground by suggesting that we might take a larger view than that which would be confined to the financial or population interests of Dorset or Hampshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment seeks to highlight the major area as that of the New Forest, and suggests that the New Forest looks to Ringwood as the major town, which for many generations it has been. I am a little influenced by the fact that in the Committee there are two hon. Members representing constituencies in Dorset and none representing Hampshire. My hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, North (Mr. David James), with his usual eloquent persuasion, will be putting the case for Dorset and I must do likewise. If I put a slightly more balanced view than I otherwise would it is because there is no hon. Member for Hampshire present on the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hampshire is three times the size of Dorset in population; the rateable value is twice that of Dorset. I make no bones about saying forthwith that the 182,000 people who will ultimately reside in Dorset are fortunate, not only because it is one of the loveliest counties in Great Britain but also because the county council of Dorset is a first-rate authority, as efficient as any other in Great Britain. Those who live under it are lucky in that respect, too. I do not say that out of constituency patriotism; I have myself
	<span class='label label-info column'>904</span>
served on two local authorities. It is a belief based on evidence and experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With that background, the Amendment seeks to retain in Hampshire, Christchurch East, Sopley and Ringwood and to retain in Dorset, Hum, St. Leonards and St. Ives. Under the new proposal Dorset will have a population increase of 182,000 and a rateable value increase of over £12½ million. Within those figures I think we can be generous enough to argue that the trifling change proposed in the Amendment is not significant to either the population or rateable value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main argument against the proposal is that when we come to dividing the county into districts it could be difficult. It would have been possible for the Bill to define the districts, leaving the Boundary Commission to put the pieces of the jigsaw together to form the counties, but the Government have chosen to do it the other way. As no one knows what districts will emerge from the counties, I do not think that this is an argument to which one can, at this stage, attach great value or even argue with conviction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other small issues. The educational system of Ringwood is geared to the Sixth Form College at Brockenhurst and it will be inconvenient to take it into Dorset. One could dwell upon police or fire or social services, but I think the inconvenience in these small matters will increase if the organisation be transferred to Dorset.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I think my hon. Friend the Member for the New Forest (Mr. Patrick McNair-Wilson), if he were able to be here, would not place great emphasis upon those matters. What he would say is, first, that the population—whether one considers letters in the Press, petitions or local councillors—are almost unanimous that this Amendment should be passed. We ought have regard to the popular wish. Secondly, I think he would dwell on the New Forest as an area. The New Forest was the hunting ground of kings. It is an area of outstanding natural beauty. It is an area of high amenity and recreational importance. There is a need for good will and effective control, and a need for protection on the periphery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ringwood does—and through the centuries always has—looked to the New Forest, and as a planning entity I would have thought it was well that the two should go together. The New Forest has been described as a "miraculous survival
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0494">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>905</span>
of pre-Norman England". New Forest commoners are descendants of men who have pastured cattle and ponies on the Forest in Saxon times. They still exercise their grazing rights, and disputes affecting those rights are still decided by the ancient Verderers' Court of Swainmote and Attachment, almost the only sole survivor of the mini-courts of Forest Law, which once held sway over much of England, with powers of life and death over those who stole the king's deer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I do not want to rest the case wholly upon that kind of sentiment. Today timber production, rather than the hunting of deer, is the main concern of the Crown although its activities extend to the protection of wildlife and the safeguarding of public amenities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think I have said enough to show that here is an area which is of such outstanding significance that the minor arguments, which inevitably must take place some time between Hampshire and Dorset are subordinate. I take—and it is right that this Committee should take—the larger view. I have here a telegram which runs thus:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Verderers of the New Forest support Amendment to Local Government Bill to include whole of the New Forest perambulation and a cushion area in Hampshire. Malmesbury."</p></blockquote>
It is signed by the official Verderer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am the Member for Dorset and it is my function—and I try to fulfil that function—to speak for Dorset. Perhaps, therefore, I have departed from normal custom in trying to take the larger view. I have done so in the certain knowledge that the case for Dorset will not go unspoken, and my hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, North will put that case. I have tried not to come down too much on one side or the other. There is room for two views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not suggesting that tie future of either county will depend greatly upon this. It is a minor matter, but I think both sides of the case ought to be talked about. When my hon. Friend answers the debate, I hope that he will pay regard to some of the debating points I have put.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David James</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend on agreeing to the name "Dorset", if only for the fact that I would not have been able to go home this weekend if he had not taken that view. I have had 30 letters from parish councils
	<span class='label label-info column'>906</span>
in the last four days, and if I slip out of the Committee in a few minutes' time it will only be to send some 30 telegrams to tell them that Dorset is safe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to my hon. Friend's Amendment. I assure him that I appreciate not only his motive in moving this Amendment but also the manner in which he has done so, with which I have a great deal of sympathy. If I feel bound to oppose it, it is purely on more mundane considerations than the manner in which the New Forest Verderers' Court works. One could make out an admirable case for leaving in Hampshire everything that is currently Hampshire. Equally, one could make out an admirable case for sticking to the Bill as printed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is very hard indeed to make out is a case for detaching Christchurch but not the hinterland behind it, which would make a viable district. Unless my figures are wrong, the area which it is proposed to add to Dorset is approximately 52,000 people, which would make a very convenient district with Christchurch and the hinterland. But remove the five parishes as proposed by this Amendment, and the population transfer goes down to 32,000 which is below the viability line and would, therefore, have the effect of chucking Christchurch into the Bournemouth ambit and disbalancing the urban rural balance of the proposed new Dorset.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have done my best to meet my hon. Friend's point of view—I fully recognise its sincerity—with a few sums. In particular, I wondered whether it would be possible simply to detach Ringwood itself. This would mean that there would be only 8,000 people out of the 52,000 who would have to go. But this does not really work, as is evidenced by a letter from the Clerk of Ringwood; I realise that I am talking to one of his predecessors, because I believe my right hon. Friend started his professional life as Clerk of Ringwood. It divides itself most awkwardly. There is the North ward with 2,688 electors, the Hangersley ward with 1,325, the South ward with 3,493 and the Bisterne ward, which in area is greater than the other three put together, which has a mere 206 people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, no intermediate solution which would detach Ringwood—which I would fully understand—but not the rest of the area, seems even reasonably practical in geographic terms. I am forced back to the position which I adopt
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0495">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>907</span>
with a certain amount of reluctance—because I think my hon. Friend has been very eloquent—that it should be the whole cake or nothing, and that any sort of intermediate solution is not easy to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I might anticipate another Amendment, there is another difficulty here. The effect of the Amendment as it stands is that both the New Forest parliamentary constituency and the new Christchurch and Lymington constituency will be astride county boundaries, and I do not think that any Member of Parliament will be happy in those circumstances. I have always—and this is purely an individual opinion—been attracted by the possible idea that Christchurch and Lymington as a parliamentary constituency could come into Dorset, leaving the existing New Forest constituency intact. I suggest this idea should be investigated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have stated what I believe to be the objections to a proposal sincerely put forward. I should be be perfectly happy—because I recognise that this is a difficult question—if my hon. Friend were even to decide to chew the cud and come back on this one on Report. I am sure that all of us only want to see the best for all concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friends the Members for Dorset, North (Mr. David James) and Dorset, South (Mr. Evelyn King) for putting both sides of the argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like at once to give my conclusion. I do not think that the Bill is right in taking Ringwood away from the New Forest. I believe that Ringwood is an integral part of the New Forest and that there ought to be an Amendment to the Bill restoring Ringwood to Hampshire, so that it remains part of the New Forest. Ringwood is right on the edge of the forest. Part of it is in the forest. One cannot possibly say that Picket Post, which is at the top of Poulner Hill as one goes out of Ringwood, is not part of Ringwood and Ringwood not part of the forest. It is an area known within the forest, and I have it in mind to put down an Amendment which would place Ring-wood back into Hampshire. This Amendment is not on the Order Paper, because the Amendments on the Order Paper include other parishes as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To the south of Ringwood there is the parish of Sopley, which is very small
	<span class='label label-info column'>908</span>
having regard to population. I think it would be right to put that with Ring-wood. To the west of Ringwood there is the Avon Valley which should undoubtedly go with the area more to the west. It may, therefore, be right to divide the parish of Sopley, but again I would not wish to do it in Committee. I hope to take between now and Report the views of the local authorities concerned as to the right line to draw.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Coming further to the south, one comes to the parish of Christchurch, East, which is undoubtedly an extension of the interests of Christchurch. I do not wish to include that with Ringwood and Sopley as moving it back into Hampshire. Having decided that we are to have Poole, Bournemouth and Christchurch all within Doreset, one has to look at the districts to be formed along the south coast: Poole a district, Bournemouth a district, and one is then left with the rather undersized district of Christchurch.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would not have thought that the people of Christchurch would wish to be compressed into a district with Bournemouth. Therefore, having deprived, on a population basis, Christchurch of the possibility of joining with Ringwood, my mind goes to the east, as my hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, North suggested, of taking in Lymington. Lymington is so much the forest part of the southern part of Hampshire that this would be going too far in extending the boundary. We have drawn a boundary between the new Hampshire and the new Dorset which runs right through the built-up area of Barton and Highcliffe. I think we are wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I propose to take the view of the local authorities in the area for including part of Lymington with Christchurch: that is Barton Ward, Milton Ward, Bashley Ward and Becton Ward. That would take in the continuous built-up area from Christchurch.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, it is for the Boundary Commission to decide what the districts should be, but, on that basis, if one is thinking of moving a county boundary, and one looks to see how the districts will work out, with some adjustments to the parishes Sopley and Hum, which has Hurn Airport- we may have the same problems over Hum Airport as we have had with Elmdon and Birmingham one gets a district in the 50,000 mark for Christchurch. This is a reasonable figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0496">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>909</span>
These Amendments are not on the Order Paper and, having only brought them into public view at this stage, I wish to take the views of the local authorities concerned on them. But I consider it a reasonable, solution for this part of the country. I hope Bournemouth and Christchurch combine to put Christ-church Harbour into one authority instead of having a boundary through the middle. Perhaps we should have a better harbour than in the past if it were all within, say, the Christchurch area and the small areas of Wick and Tuckton in Bournemouth. In the end it is a matter of deciding districts and I suggest a county boundary—which will solve the problems which my hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, South has put concerning Ringwood and the problems which my hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, North has put concerning a reasonable district.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One key to it all is the conviction that Ringwood should be in Hampshire with the New Forest, and from that follows a revision which would give Christchurch a very good local government area. I ask my hon. Friends to be good enough to leave these matters outstanding, and allow me to consult the local authorities and consider this so that an Amendment may be put down on Report stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Cocks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 373, in page 189, line 11, at end insert—
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the administrative county of Wiltshire, the rural district of Mere and Tisbury.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this Amendment we can discuss Amendment No. 374, in page 192, line 39, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"except the rural district of Mere and Tisbury".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cocks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are essentially Amendments to tidy up what is, in fact, the extreme south-west corner of the County of Wiltshire, and the rural district of Mere and Tisbury. Perhaps the Minister will study the map of Wiltshire because this is a county which is essentially an area of uplands with the Cots-wolds to the north, including the area around Chippenham, and the chalk of the Marlborough downs and the Salisbury downs. Arranged around these peri-
	<span class='label label-info column'>910</span>
pherally are a number of towns which together form a group—Warminster, Westbury, Trowbridge and Bradford.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mere and Tisbury is very much the odd area out in this setting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a rather different area of settlement land use and topography from the remainder. The area is coming down from the Salisbury downs, is changing in character—and the Minister will have noted the disappearance of the characteristic strip parishes of the chalk down-land—and is not really oriented towards the rest of Wiltshire. It is much more a natural continuation of the area around Shaftesbury rural district.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be in the interests of good local government if this part of Wiltshire were tidied up, removed and tacked on to the next county because, together with Shaftesbury, it would form a reasonable district council. At the moment, Shaftesbury is on the edge of its rural district, and if Mere and Tisbury was taken in there would be an area of which Shaftesbury was approximately central and there would be strong community of interests such as transport and education. I know the Minister has not said that the educational argument is paramount, but I point out to him that there is the comprehensive school at Gillingham which provides secondary education for the Mere and Tisbury area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the basis of these facts, I ask the Minister to look at this case—the lack of identity with the rest of Wiltshire, the ready-made district council which could be formed by the amalgamation of Shaftesbury and Mere and Tisbury—and consider whether, in the interests of future efficiency and community interest, this Amendment might be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

used such phrases as "to tidy up" the extreme south-west corner of Wiltshire; that the rural district of Mere and Tisbury is the "odd area out" of Wiltshire; that they are "rather different in character" from the rest of Wiltshire; and that they have "a strong community of interest" with Shaftesbury. I do not think that the hon. Gentleman can ever have been to that district of Mere and Tisbury. I have some marginal knowledge of it, having actually lived inside it for the first 18 years of my life, and having strong personal contacts with that part of Wiltshire even now. I feel sure that my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary will disagree with the hon. Member for Bristol, South, so I shall not enlarge upon it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member should do his homework a little better before he makes such dogmatic statements about a part of Wiltshire which is certainly as closely connected with the rest of the county as any other part of it. Without enlarging on any of the other points which I wished to make, I shall stop at this point, except possibly to add to the Parliamentary Secretary's remarks if I think he has left anything out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. King</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Member for Bristol, South (Mr. Michael Cocks) is a distinguished geographer—indeed, cartographer, as I understand it—and therefore I hesitate to disagree with him. I would just put to him that, cartography and geography aside, it is slightly odd to suggest that two or three towns should be transferred from one county to another when the county from which they come, the people who live in those places, and the counties to which they are to be transported, have not the slightest desire for this change to take place. His is a curious eloquence, and I hope that my hon. Friend can dismiss it in a very few words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>912</span>
If I may come to the substance of the debate that the hon. Member for Bristol, South (Mr. Michael Cocks) has put before us, it would be possible to go to a large number of the rural counties and say that a particular area should be moved one way or the other because it was a tidying-up operation. The nature of the counties and the county boundaries must have an element of irrationality about them, but I do not think that it is the purpose of local government reorganisation to look for all the marginal cases which are difficult to pin down and define.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the views expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Devizes (Mr. Charles Morrison), although I do not know how he knew that I would express them, that it would be a mistake for the Committee to seek to make great inroads into the County of Wiltshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand the background to the proposal that Mere and Tisbury should be moved south into Dorset, it arose from the suggestion from Shaftesbury that those neighbouring parishes would have a community of interest with Shaftesbury and therefore should be moved into Dorset.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The County of Dorset did not argue the case, and those who are supposed to have this community of interest find it difficult to argue in support of it, and have made it quite clear that they are not in favour of the Amendment. One could even argue the Amendment the other way around, and say that if the community of interest exists, Wiltshire should be raiding Dorset's territory. I do not wish to suggest to my hon. Friend that that is in my mind, because I suspect we should then be on the Amendment rather longer than we would wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument could go either way, and similar arguments could be found all over this countryside. If there is an argument for tidying up the immediate areas surrounding Shaftesbury, that is a matter for the Boundary Commission, and we have told the Council at Shaftesbury that this is what we would see the Boundary Commission do. The very words "tidying up" imply what we had in mind initially, and perhaps the hon. Member for Bristol, South will not press the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fox</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos. 503-506 are designed to ensure that the interests of Teesside are shown to be to the north of the Tees, or to the west, with the County of Durham, rather than with the north of Yorkshire. I refer the Committee to paragraph 8 of Cmnd. 4584:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Local authority areas should be related to areas in which people have a common interest—through living in a recognisable community, through the links of employment, shopping or social activities, or through history and tradition."</p></blockquote>
On all of these counts I submit that Whitby and the surrounding areas should be in North Yorkshire County No. 5 and not Teesside No. 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Should the Bill go through as it is, we shall find not one recognisable community but two. As it is well known to
	<span class='label label-info column'>914</span>
many hon. Members, Teesside is a vast industrial complex with tremendous potential, and with plenty of land within its boundaries which can be claimed or reclaimed for expansion. Seamer Sands is a classic example. By no stretch of imagination can its future be said to depend either on its extension southwards into Whitby rural district area, or into Stokesey rural district area, a point which was effectively made at our last sitting by the hon. Member for The Hartlepools (Mr. Leadbitter).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the hon. Gentleman's support, his observations on the benefits of that expansion will eventually come to Teesside, and his thoughtfulness in bringing these observations to the attention of the Committee. I welcome also the support of the other two hon. Members representing Yorkshire seats—who sit opposite. The hon. Member for Goole (Dr. Marshall) wishes to make his own observations, and it may be that the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. James Johnson) will wish to do the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have here a reasonable map of the area, large scale, which should convince any hon. Member that the interests of the area lie within the rural county of North Yorkshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking of sparsely populated rural areas, and a number of fishing villages, the largest being the port of Whitby. Perhaps the best illustration of the difference betwen this area and Teesside is that it is hardly the mark of an urban area that the few hundred schoolchildren who get on the train in the Esk Valley to be taken to Whitby, or to return home, must each day, at this time of the year, take an overnight bag in case the weather deteriorates, and arrangements are made by the education committee of the North Riding County Council for them to stay overnight in Whitby.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the Christmas Recess like many other hon. Members I took the opportunity of visiting areas which we should be discussing subsequently in the Bill. I spent two days in Whitby urban district and Whitby rural district with my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Michael Shaw). Not that I needed to revisit those places. They have been known to me all my life. As one travels from York to Malton,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0499">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>915</span>
to Pickering and over the North Yorkshire moors to Fylingdales, and past the early warning station, the view of Robin Hood's Bay and Whitby is unforgettable. In all fairness, no Yorkshireman could sit by and see the 26 parishes and rural areas of Whitby, Sandsend, Runswick Bay, Staithes absorbed in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To turn inland is to be made even more aware of the outstanding beauty of the area. When I tell members of the Committee that virtually the whole of it is within a national park, I hope that they will appreciate the seriousness of the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As one proceeds north of Staithes one is struck immediately by the change in the countryside. Before long, without any shadow of doubt, it changes from rural to urban. It is no part of my submission that Loftus, Skinningrove, Brotton and Skelton should be taken out of Teesside. They are tied to the economy of Teesside, and belong there. I hope that I have said enough to make hon. Members realise the depth of feeling which exists on these proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move now to the question of links of employment as contained within the document which I mentioned at the beginning. Again, I must mention the hon. Member for The Hartlepools (Mr. Leadbitter). In reply to an intervention from me at a previous sitting, he confirmed my view that Whitby and its surrounding areas cannot possibly benefit from any improvement in the economy of Teesside. The heavy industry there has nothing whatever in common with the areas concerned in the Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To talk of Whitby as a commuter belt for Teesside is hardly worth examination. Geographically it is impossible for people to be certain of getting to work all the year round. Of the employed population in Whitby of 4,703, less than 500 work on Teesside. More, in fact, work within the Pickering area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems a pity to spoil such an excellent case, which I intend to support in the near future, but my figures indicate that there are more than 500 out of the 4,700—a little under 600, I think. It is a pity to spoil a good case in this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fox</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is saying that it is not between 400 and 500 but rather 600—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>916</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Between 500 and 600 commuting to Teesside.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fox</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not disagree with the hon. Member, but that is certainly not the up-to-date figure I have, which has been computed, I think, from a very reliable source. But be that as it may—I will give an odd hundred to the hon. Member—most of those are construction workers. Their work is temporary. They are taken in special buses. There is no question of the railway links or bus services being adequate for commuting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who would want to commute from Whitby to Middlesbrough in winter, when the departure time from Whitby is 6.55 in the morning and it takes 1 hour 20 minutes at a cost of 43p to cover 31 miles? The next train after that is at 9.30. I hardly think that that is any use at all to day workers or shift workers. The bus services, depending on the route taken, can take between 1 hour 37 minutes and 1 hour 57 minutes. Within our terms in the North, that is not a travel-to-work area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this amalgamation takes place the opposite could apply; the employment situation within Whitby and the rural district could become worse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a letter from the Chairman of the Harbour Committee in Whitby, who writes that he is
	<br><blockquote><p>"very troubled as to what could happen to this undertaking, together with the large number of people directly and indirectly employed therewith.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>A number of years ago, Lord Hailsham during an official visit to Whitby, advised that if we wanted anything (referring to light industry, etc.) it was up to us to help ourselves.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Since that time and through our own efforts, the Harbour in all departments and ancillary businesses has grown out of all recognition—a considerable increase in size and numbers of vessels of the fishing fleet—a wharf accommodating over two hundred ships per year (importing and exporting)—pleasure craft more than trebled, each giving promise of continuing expansion and in my estimation giving employment to about three hundred people.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>My own view, a view shared by very many others in Whitby and district, is that our joining with the new Teesside County Council would see the gradual running down of this growing enterprise, due to what would be our minority representation against that of the Teesside and the Hartlepool Authorities, who would quite naturally favour the interests of their respective Port undertakings."</p></blockquote>
That is a reasonable conclusion to draw, just as it is reasonable to say that within the Whitby urban district and rural district there is no land which can be of any use to industrial Teesside. Teesside has enough land of its own. In Billingham there are 50 acres of land available for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0500">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>917</span>
development; Stockton has 18 acres; Eaglescliffe has 80 acres; Eston has 25 acres; Thornaby has 200 acres; and in Seal Sands 200 acres per year are being reclaimed for a complex which has every prospect of bringing considerable prosperity to that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are some of the stories that I have collected in my travels in that part of the country. It adds up to the fact that this is not in character or background an area that should be tied to Teesside. All its interests are towards Scarborough, Bridlington, Malton and York. There is no question of people going to Middlesbrough to shop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whitby's problems are those of the other holiday resorts on the North Yorkshire coast. Depending upon the weather, they have a fairly prosperous short summer season, and a long, hard winter with considerable problems of unemployment. These areas have been fairly successful in finding light industry and, on their own, certainly within the complex of a North Yorkshire county, they will do far better than is proposed in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall say no more about the history of Whitby, because it speaks for itself. My last point concerns the wishes of the people. The Minister has accepted the worth of this referendum. The figures were given at a meeting previously, but I shall repeat them. Bearing in mind the geography of this area at the time that this was taken, in December and the early part of January, it is not easy, with dark nights, to contact electors. But 70.95 per cent. of the total electorate of the urban district and rural district were called on; and 96.4 per cent. opted to remain in Yorkshire. I am sure that the Minister will take account of that when he replies. The wish of the people has been established. The Minister has always been courteous during the sittings of the Committee. Above all else, he pays regard to the interests of the people who are affected by these boundaries. I appeal to him to accept the Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move on to the part of the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Kitson). In the company of my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack) I pent a day in that part of the world. I snow that my hon. Friend the Members for Cannock and my hon. Friend the
	<span class='label label-info column'>918</span>
Member for Brierley Hill (Mr. Montgomery) wish to speak on these Amendments. I simply say that the story was the same. I do not pretend that these areas are not closer to Teesside, but in character they are little different from the areas and communities that I have described previously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must be tired of petitions, but there is a rather remarkable petition from Great and Little Ayton—remarkable in the sense that within 10 days, out of an electorate of 3,500 more than 3,000 people signed it. I believe that it was signed between eight and ten points in the village. It was not a matter of people knocking on doors and asking for signatures; 3,000 residents of Great Ayton went out of their way to sign the petition pleading with my hon. Friend to be allowed to stay within Yorkshire where they rightfully belong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Between the White Paper and publication of the Bill the Secretary of State had taken out certain parts of the Stokesley Rural District. It is important to realise that the parishes left within Teesside are still villages. One accepts that there are commuters who live in Great Ayton and move towards Middlesbrough and Teesside, but this is a village. It has the character of a village, and it wants to remain so. It cannot be blamed, considering the urban sprawl that has extended gradually, as parts of North Yorkshire and South Durham have come together to form Teesside. The people concerned cannot be blamed for wanting to stop this sprawl. In the few remarks I make it is my intention to do what I can to bring about a change of heart.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Great Ayton looks towards Stokesley for its market and shopping. The children of Great Ayton go to a comprehensive school in Stokesley. Reorganisation went through in a very pleasant way. The children go there now, and are happy to do so. Stokesley virtually serves Great Ayton and yet in the Bill we are accepting a radical change of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

As a younger man, I thought in my innocence that the Opposition's duty was to oppose. However, I had not been
	<span class='label label-info column'>920</span>
long in the House before that notion was knocked out of my head, in terms of local government. For example, many years ago I found myself in the company of the then hon. Members for Stratford-upon-Avon and Leamington, aligned against my hon. Friends the Members for Coventry. Thus, it is often no sin moderately to support an Amendment tabled by hon. Members opposite.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having affirmed my integrity and my innocence in this respect, and in spite of the Whip moving so heavily along these benches a few moments ago, I wish to declare my interest in East Yorkshire. I am a Humberside Member. Many years ago I lived in Scarborough. But for the outbreak of the war I might have become a Labour Councillor there. I know that part of the world quite well, and I support the remarks made earlier by the hon. Member for Shipley (Mr. Fox).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, knowing the place as I do—having walked on the moors, sailed in a fishing vessel off the coast, and played games in Whitby Town and Scarborough—I can only echo what has been said about the complete dissimilarity between this part of the Cleveland Plateau, which slopes south-eastwards towards the Vale of Pickering and Scarborough and Malton. That is where such places as Whitby have their being, and that is where they wish to stay—in the administrative county of North Yorkshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several Sittings ago my hon. Friend the Member for The Hartlepools (Mr. Leadbitter) and I exchanged a few words. I accused him of being not a Marxist but perhaps a mild determinist. No one looking at the geography, topography, landscape, setting and environment—the whole of the living conditions of the people—could imagine that the people of North-East Yorkshire would look over the top down the sharp scarp towards the mouth of the Tees, rather than wish to belong, as in the past, to North-East Yorkshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people of the moors and dales are completely distinctive in their patterns of behaviour, their way of thinking, and their entire attitude towards life. They are not shaped in the same way of life as those who work in the steelworks of Teesport and elsewhere. I think that Middlesbrough and the Lower Tees valley belong to the Tyneside-Wearside area. That is where the people live and co-habit. That is where they take themselves—not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0502">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>921</span>
over the top but over the Cleveland Moors, towards the Whitbys and other towns, towards Scarborough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the people that I know there have come out in one voice. There is an association—"The Whitbys for Yorkshire", I believe it is called—which has within its membership anybody of status in the area. I cannot quote statistics, but thousands of names have been added to petitions. I know of no dissident voice in the campaign.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of all these people—many living nearer Hull than the Durham coalfield or shipbuilding belt—numbering about 7,000, fewer than 500 or 600 commute. My figure of 600 was taken a short time ago. Unemployment, or some other hideous happening, may have changed those figures in the meantime.

One could talk of agriculture, fishing, light industries, and so on, but none of these is the type of activity to be found in this conurbation. I will not say a word about the imbroglio that developed a little earlier on the question of Teesport. That has nothing to do with my present comments, which I make as a Humberside Member about North-East Yorkshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One could go into the question whether the multi-county national park would be better in the hands of one council, committee or administration. To discuss the water and other services would commit me to making a definite statement in favour of the "Whitbys for Yorkshire" campaign. I believe that people on the Yorkshire Moors, Goathland and Whitby would be submerged if they were to be included in the enormous conurbation north of the scarp, along with the activities of the Tees Valley—I.C.I., shipbuilding and steel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

I am delighted to have the chance of supporting the splendid speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley. I was part of the "mini-Pearce Commission" which visited the Richmond constituency a fortnight ago. It is a lovely part of a great and historic county. In the course of an interesting day—unfortunately we could not see much because of the Yorkshire mists—we visited Low and High Worsall, Crathorne, Picton, and Great Ayton itself. Everywhere we went we were met with tremendous enthusiasm. These were people who really cared.

I want to refer to the first speech that I made in this Committee, when I quoted the words of my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives (Mr. Nott) in his moving contribution to the debate on the Gracious Speech. My hon. Friend said that the real poor of the twentieth century were those without roots. That sentiment was echoed throughout the House. The people of North Yorkshire have roots, and their roots are in North Yorkshire. I did not know the area well before I went, although I had visited it. It was a great joy to go again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to refer first to Great Ayton, because it is the largest of the villages referred to in the Amendments. In all their long history, the people of Great Ayton, have probably never been more concerned about the future of their village. The Petition to which my hon. Friend referred is ample and moving evidence of this. The village has retained its identity. It has had a growing sense of history, and now sees itself and its security threatened. Captain Cook went to school there. Surely my hon. Friend, who is a sensitive and knowledgeable man, will not be so indifferent to local wishes and needs, as defined by local geography, as to disguise the identity of Captain Cook's village. There is an enormous community spirit there. It would be nice of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell), who has constantly upbraided me
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0503">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>923</span>
in the Committee, would listen to me for a change—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denis Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not only will I listen to you; in due course I shall reply very effectively to you.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will not reply effectively to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not dream of doing that, Sir Stephen; your conduct is impeccable. I shall reply to the hon. Gentleman in due course. Suffice to say, for the moment, that Captain Cook, in his day, was also engaged upon piracy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To impugn the name of a great navigator and Yorkshireman in that despicable way is totally inexcusable. I am sure that the whole Committee would wish me to censure the hon. Gentleman—as he has so frequently deserved censure during the past few weeks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell), belonging to Birmingham, must, by definition, be a landlubber. We must excuse him his lack of knowledge of these nautical subjects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged for that lesson in charity. I shall attempt to benefit from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an enormous community spirit in this village. It is expressed in modern terms in some of the superb facilities it has created for its people. I want to give two quotations. First, in an article in the 	<i>Yorkshire Life</i> magazine, in the summer of last year, the writer concluded:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Even as a West Riding chap I want Great Ayton to remain well and truly in Yorkshire. What's more, I'm sure that Captain Cook, a true Yorkshireman, despite his gallivanting round the globe, would wholeheartedly agree."</p></blockquote>
The other document to which I want to refer is a letter from an ex-constituent of mine who, about 18 months ago, moved to Great Ayton. She wrote to me at considerable length. I wish to quote two or three parts of her letter, because I think that the outsider going in and feeling part of a community can often given a truer indication of the situation than can one who has lived there all the time. She says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I have only lived in this area for about two years and three months yet in that time I very strongly support the unanimous feeling of the people of Great Ayton that this historic and
	<span class='label label-info column'>924</span>
ancient village should be left where it has always been, in the North Riding of Yorkshire.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Upon our arrival in Great Ayton it was soon apparent that this village has nothing in common with Teesside other than persons going into their various places of employment. I can tell you that in the time we have been here, I have not visited Middlesbrough more than six times. In common with the greater number of inhabitants shopping is done locally or in Northallerton, York or Harrogate."</p></blockquote>
That letter is an illustration of the Yorkshire community feeling of this village of Great Ayton, and I make no apology for quoting from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But if Great Ayton is the largest of the villages referred to in these Amendments it is not the only one. Crathorne and Picton have a petition, in which I am sure hon. Members will be interested, which begins:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We the undersigned being the entire adult population of the Parishes of Crathorne and Picton wish to make representation for inclusion in the County of North Yorkshire instead of in the enlarged County of Teesside."</p></blockquote>
When one went round those villages and saw, for instance, the village blacksmith still at work in the village of Crathorne—a rural area, with rural pursuits, and people who feel that this is part of agricultural, rural England and, more important, of rural Yorkshire—one could not but be moved by the people's determination to remain part of their native county.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same was true in the Worsalls—delightful places where, again, a petition was signed by all but a handful of the local inhabitants. I appeal most strongly to my hon. Friend, as an outsider who went in, felt at home, and was convinced by this local feeling. When we went we were fêted like heroes. We did not have the difficulties that the Pearce Commission is obviously experiencing. We knew that the local people wanted something done, and it was a great delight to have the chance to do it for them. One could say, without being out of order, Sir Stephen, that it is illustrative of the termendous local feeling that a party from this area has actually come to listen to the deliberations of this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When one talks about Teesside one does not criticise it but it is clear that the community interests of the two areas are different I would say that the area under discussion is best kept and administered as it is. There are justifiable grounds for alarm; the soulless housing which has suburbanised the rural charm of part of North Yorkshire already; the idea—
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0504">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>925</span>
which we were told about when we were going round Crathorne—that a marina should be put in one of these lovely valleys and that performing porpoises, no doubt, should delight the visitors from Teesside in future years. But that is not what it is all about; it is not the sort of rural area in which the people of Teesside would really enjoy refreshing and recreating themselves. They want the area left as it is at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore make this strong appeal to my hon. Friend. Far too often we talk about the country which feeds the town, and sometimes we give occasion for the town to eat the country in return. I hope that my hon. Friend will not do that here, and that he will honour the pledge given in the White Paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I put it to the hon. Gentleman that his name is signed to an Amendment that will bring part of my constituency, for instance—which has just as attractive countryside, with just the same traditions, and so on—into Teesside. The only difference is that parts of my constituency are about 10 times as far away from Teesside as is Great Ayton. I cannot understand how the hon. Gentleman came to put his name to such an Amendment as this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I explained at the beginning why I did so. If the hon. Gentleman will pay me the courtesy of reading my speech he will know that I did. He will have an opportunity to catch your eye, Sir Stephen, and make his own case in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman was "conned".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We cannot have sedentary remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend will honour the pledge given in the White Paper; that they will pay regard to these people, who are proud of their county—the people of these fine villages who wish to remain in Yorkshire. I hope that he will realise that no stroke of any pen, and no Act of any Parliament, can remove deep-rooted sentiments and a sense of history. If my hon. Friend attempts so to do he will alienate a community that ought to be there and destroy something which is of inestimable worth. I have the greatest possible pleasure in supporting the Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>926</span>
	<p>5.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Edmund Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Shipley (Mr. Marcus Fox) indicated, I am closely interested in the proposals for the northern part of Yorkshire and the Amendments that are now before us. As a Member for a Yorkshire constituency which is to be divided four ways by the county boundaries proposed in the Bill I am eager to see that no part of the present counties of Yorkshire are assigned to a new county unless there is a very good case for so doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must consider the areas lying on the boundary between North Yorkshire and Teesside in that light, and we must state good reasons for their being included with Teesside in a new county. In particular, I support very strongly Amendments Nos. 239 and 240, the effect of which is to transfer the Whitby urban district and Whitby rural district from the proposed Teesside county back to the North Yorkshire county. As has been described by both the hon. Member for Shipley (Mr. Fox) and my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. James Johnson), the two Whitby areas are of an entirely different character from that of the areas that form the main part of Teesside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had the description geologically and geographically. We know that Whitby is an historic fishing port, and that the population in the Whitby urban and rural areas is scattered, with 23,790 people occupying 116,000 acres. If that population is to be of value in any local government sense I submit that it will be of more value if it is reassigned to the North Yorkshire county, which is a predominantly rural county.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the Whitby area has connections with the south—in particular with Scarborough—in respect of many public service undertakings. The water undertaking serving Whitby is centred on Scarborough, and the main central electricity point for the locality is Scarborough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for Government Departments, the office of the Department of Health and Social Security—which hands out the money—is at Scarborough, and the local office of the Inland Revenue—which takes in the money—is also at Scarborough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be a tragedy if the whole North Yorkshire moors area was to be divided between different counties. Here we have a National Park, I understand
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0505">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>927</span>
that if Amendments Nos. 239 and 240 are accepted virtually the whole of the North Yorkshire Moors National Park will be retained in a single county. I support the Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I dissociate myself completely with Amendments Nos. 40, 503, 504, 505 and 506, which are totally unnecessary to give effect to the proposals for transferring Whitby. I regard this as a piece of extra slipping-in—of trying to dismantle the whole of the Teesside county purely to satisfy the people who want changes in the southern boundary of Teesside. There is no need to dismantle Teesside. Let us have the Whitby rural and urban districts incorporated in north Yorkshire, but let Teesside stand in its own right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. King</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to rise a third time in an afternoon, the more so because this is not of outright concern to my constituency. However, I assure the Committee that I can say what I want to say in about three minutes. My right hon. Friend the Member for Thirsk and Malton (Mr. Turton) is Father of the House, but as he is not a member of the Committee he cannot speak for himself. He has asked me to tell the Committee that this Amendment has his wholehearted support. The case has been argued so thoroughly by those living in the area that it is hardly necessary for me to say very much more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that Whitby is a rural district. Its association with Teesside is undesirable. Teesside is a district of a totally different character. If the Amendment is not accepted a national park will be split in two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whitby is also a seaside resort. It has its own unemployment problem. My constituency is very much associated with this problem. For that reason, too, I hope that the Committee will accept the Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Blenkinsop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intervene briefly. I have been a strong supporter of the idea that town and country can no longer be looked at separately. In planning and other matters we need to look ahead. There is a need for effective joint planning. For that purpose I want a regional centre, and not this kind of centre. I make it clear that the fact that I have advocated strongly the whole concept of broad regional planning, comprehending both urban and rural areas, is no reason for supporting the Government's proposals
	<span class='label label-info column'>928</span>
in this case. I accept the view with regard to the southern area, but not in respect of the villages in North Yorkshire, that I know very well. I agree that the attractive areas, in part of the national park and elsewhere, should remain with Yorkshire. I am not altogether sure that those who live there will like the suggested link-up with the Pearce Commission. I am not sure that it is a valid comparison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that there will be no doubt about throwing out the proposal that we should alter the Teesside situation with regard the northern part—the question of its link with the county of Durham. Most of us would reject the proposal in Amendment No. 503 that the area should go into Durham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The southern area is another matter. We have received much evidence about it. I admire the determination of all those who have sent us so much evidence in such a friendly and kindly way. Their persistence ought to be rewarded. Their keen support of their own position should be welcomed—as, indeed, the Minister has welcomed many similar representations in the past. I hope that he will in this case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fergus Montgomery</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to follow the hon. Member for South Shields (Mr. Blenkinsop), because we have crossed swords in the past. We opposed each other during the 1959 Election. If the hon. Gentleman does not mind my saying so, I have always found him a completely fair opponent. I am particularly glad to follow him today because I think that he is broadly in support of the Amendments that I intend to support—Amendments that have been so ably moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley (Mr. Fox).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the Amendments is to retain certain parishes in North Yorkshire rather than put them into the new Teesside area. The Bill gives the impression that the rural district of Stokesley has been mutilated; part of it is to go into North Yorkshire and part into Teesside. The aim of the Amendments is to ensure that the rural district of Stokesley is kept intact in the new metropolitan county of North Yorkshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said on an earlier Amendment that I was born in the North-East. When I was younger I visited this area a great deal. I do not think that hon. Members on either side of the Committee could deny that it is an area of great beauty and charm. The local people are anxious that it should
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0506">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>929</span>
remain so. They are fearful that if they are merged as part of the Teesside area they will become the victims of over-sprawl, and that the charm and beauty they know today will disappear. I understand their fears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a rural district in my constituency which at one time was threatened with being dismembered but which I am delighted to say the Government have now rescued, although certain hon. Gentlemen opposite have other ideas. I know the enormous indignation which was caused at the Seisdon rural district in my constituency at the prospect of being hived off into the West Midland Metropolitan County. It is the same sort of anger that I think the people in these North Yorkshire parishes feel today. They live in those parishes as a deliberate act of policy. They have gone to live there because they want to escape the urban sprawl and because they wish to live in a rural community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this country today far too much lip-service is paid to maintaining the countryside. It is essential that great industrial areas like Teesside should have pleasant countryside within easy reach, where people can go for relaxation and enjoy the beauties of the countryside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to stress the case for Newby, a small village of some 45 dwellings, with a further 10 to 15 dwellings scattered through the remainder of the parish. That gives some idea of just how rural the area is. Newby is a wholly agricultural community and has nothing in common with industrial Teesside. To merge it with Teesside would be entirely wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people in that area—and I think this applies to all the parishes under discussion today—were tremendously worried some five years ago when the Teesside conurbation first came into being. They felt at that time that there was a danger that they might be swallowed up, and I am sure that there was a great sigh of relief when they found that they were saved. Their anxiety has been rekindled by the publication of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am told that in Newby a petition was signed by practically every adult in the parish. As my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley (Mr. Fox) said, there is also the case for Great Ayton. I believe I am right in saying that the people of Great Ayton sent every hon. Member of the Committee a Christmas card. I am sure that it will not influence anybody's vote, but I think that
	<span class='label label-info column'>930</span>
the thought behind the Christmas cards had its effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Great Ayton, as my hon. Friend has said, there has been tremendous public feeling. I should like to confirm what he said. The people in that area look towards Stokesley, not Teesside. It is to Stokesley that they go for their shopping. It is to Stokesley that the children go to school. That is the way they wish to continue. I am told that many of those living in Great Ayton are people who moved there in fairly recent years, who moved from villages that were swallowed up by Teesside when the Teesside conurbation was formed some five years ago. So, having escaped once from the urban sprawl, they now find themselves—[	<i>Interruption</i>]. If the hon. Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) has something to say, I can wait.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a lot of sympathy with the broad case here, but I think the three Members putting it are overdoing it—for example, the phrase "these people have escaped from Teesside once", as if Teesside is a place from which everyone automatically ought to escape. It gives offence. The hon. Gentlemen have already given offence to the people of Hartlepool and Teesside, and I suggest to them, with great respect, that it ought to be no part of their case in trying to get support to cause offence in parts of Durham. That is what I am objecting to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.0 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have advised this Committee before—and I now repeat the advice—that it is much wiser to ignore sedentary interruptions. It only prolongs the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Montgomery</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly take your advice in future, Sir Stephen. The hon. Member for Small Heath was perfectly entitled to his view and, no doubt, as a Birmingham Member he has expressed that view very forcefully, but he must know that people in the areas which are going into the new West Midlands metropolitan county are just as worried about being dominated by Birmingham as some of the people in these villages are worried about the threat of being dominated by industrial Teesside. It is as simple as that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These people are worried that again they are threatened by becoming part of a great
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0507">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>931</span>
urban community, and this is a point that has been stressed by many hon. Members, and not just on this side of the Committee. Therefore, I hope that my hon. Friend will look favourably at this group of Amendments which are designed to keep these parishes in the North Yorkshire County.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to quote to my hon. Friend a statement that was made in paragraph 8 of the White Paper:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Local authority areas should be related to areas in which people have a common interest."</p></blockquote>
I would submit that the common interest of the people of these parishes lies much more in the predominantly rural authority, such as North Yorkshire, than it does with industrial Teesside.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a continuation of the debate which started last Thursday. The interesting thing about it is that the hon. Member for Shipley (Mr. Fox), who introduced the Amendments today, followed on quite naturally from the theme that was developed then. However, because of his awareness of the problem of the drafting of the Amendment, he omitted to make references to certain parts of it which naturally raise doubts in many hon. Members' minds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To be fair to my hon. Friends and to the hon. Member for Shipley, I take it for granted that the intention in the Amendment was to persuade the Minister to look at the question again and by so doing to introduce what was, in common with us all, the need to keep the North Yorkshire traditionally-established areas out of the proposals in the Bill. I take it that that was the objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I accept that perhaps the unfortunate wording might not have occurred if the hon. Member and his colleagues had visited Teesside and Hartlepool as well as the areas in North Yorkshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must not place too much emphasis on the drafting of the Amendment. The Minister is aware—and, certainly, I am aware, since we have been working in harmony here—of the objectives that we have in mind. We are convinced that, because of the problem of Teesside as a whole, because of the varied nature of the land mass within the boundaries proposed, the variety of interests and occupations and the different community interests, to adopt a rigid posture would be a fatal mistake. This is one of our criticisms of this proposal. We accept—there is no doubt about
	<span class='label label-info column'>932</span>
this, and I make no charge—that by the very nature of the timetable real discussion in accordance with the principle laid down in paragraph 8 of the White Paper and in Circular 8/71 has not taken place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recently we sought to get common cause in order to obtain the Minister's co-operation. We felt that we should not fall into the error of a rigid position, although hon. Gentlemen who are not aware of our thinking might well have interpreted some rigidity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The northern areas involved, the Whitby Rural District Council, the Stokesley areas and the parishes therein have need to be worried. I have received a letter indicating a worry, from the Stockton Rural District. The Minister knows that meetings of an exploratory kind are taking place on the assumption that it is a 	<i>fait accompli</i> that the non-metropolitan county borough will remain unaltered. This is one of the great dilemmas of members of the Committee. On the one hand, we read in the papers that the local authorities are talking about districts within the concept of the non-metropolitan county borough, and assuming there is nothing they can do. On the other hand, we know about their worries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a recent speech, the Chairman of the Committee on Local Government of the Stockton Rural District Council told his council of a meeting he had with the Teesside County Council members:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am sorry … I have to tell you I came away from their debate saddened and disappointed. Not because some members on the Teesside Council differ from us—everyone has the right to his own opinion—but because I got the impression they do not appreciate the real issues involved. I got the impression they were so concerned with retaining their present size they had not understood the implications of the two-tier system of local government which comes into operation in 1974."</p></blockquote>
The first point about such a responsible comment is that the speaker shows a degree of magnanimity which draws us naturally to attend to what he has to say. He does not say that the Teesside County Council does not have the right to make an assertion of one kind or another; he says he understands. What puzzles him and many people outside the boundaries of the present Teesside County Borough is an awareness that those who are taking a predominant rôle in determining the districts and so forth in the Bill do not seem to convey to the participants—the people who eventually may come into the new non-county borough—that they have a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0508">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>933</span>
knowledge of the issues involved. This is very important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point is that we must bear in mind the extent to which we shall take account of other opinion—that kind of opinion which is not 	<i>in</i> any way characterised by prejudicial, political or narrow-minded thinking, but genuine, spontaneous opinion that comes from the people themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a Member representing the northern area of the proposed non-county borough, I have been impressed with the degree of co-operation which I have received from many North Yorkshire areas. As a consequence, I was sad to learn of the recent heart attack of Mr. Caldwell, the Chairman of the Great Ayton Parish Council, although a recent report shows him to be on the mend. He and his colleagues, as well as those in Whitby Rural District Council and in the Whitby urban area, by referendum and other means, have worked in complete harmony to preserve the character of an area which is so different from Teesside that the Amendment, as a consequence, has received the greatest amount of support of any other Amendment to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister knows, as I know, that the beginning of the debate which took place last Thursday was on the basis of an appeal to keep open minds—not to imply that we doubt the Minister's words or that he is making wrong judgments. The point of view has rather been that the general growth and development of Teesside as an urbanised area and the general development of the North Yorkshire rural area are so different that great care must be exercised in making a final decision on the proposals. With that in mind, I suggest that the Minister was somewhat in error in suggesting to me, on Thursday night, with reference to those Members of Parliament who gave support to that which we have in common, that there was a common willingness to discuss the question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no question about the unanimity of the feeling which the hon. Members for Shipley (Mr. Fox), for Thirsk and Malton (Sir Robin Turton), for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Michael Shaw), my right hon. Friend the Member for Middlesbrough, East (Mr. Bottomley), my hon. Friends the Members for Cleveland (Mr. Tinn), for Stockton-on-Tees (Mr. William Rodgers), for Goole (Dr. Marshall), and for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. James Johnson), and the hon. Member for
	<span class='label label-info column'>934</span>
Brierley Hill (Mr. Montgomery) and I have on this question. We are the elected representatives, and a great deal of information has been presented to us. Surprisingly enough, the judgment of the two major political parties coincide in this connection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Representations have also been made at councillor level. I remind the Committee of my remarks the other day when the Town Clerk of Teesside County Borough appealed to me to oppose hon. Gentlemen opposite in Standing Committee. I telephoned him, and posed the following question: "Do you understand that I, as a Member of Parliament, duly elected to this place to represent a constituency and with a higher responsibility than that, once in this House, must have regard to Members of Parliament, irrespective of party, who similarly represent electors by direct vote, as against the opinions of councillors in a Teesside county borough who have no rights at this stage to make an appeal one way or the other about people they do not represent?" That is the issue. Here the Minister has an opportunity to establish the rule that Whitehall does not know best. Here is a situation where Members of Parliament have made their voices heard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have supported the plea for North Yorkshire to emphasise to the Minister the need to look at Teesside as a whole, but I cannot support the Amendment of the hon. Member for Shipley (Mr. Fox). To think of putting Teesside into County Durham is quite illogical. No doubt the Minister will draw upon his comments last Thursday night to emphasise that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One must also bear in mind that the Teesside County Borough was formed only as recently as 1968. By the same token, Hartlepool was amalgamated with its ancient borough of Old Hartlepool in 1967. These reasons of recent amalgamation, added to the growth potential of the urbanised area and the industrial characteristics of the area, surrounding the Tees on both sides, mean that if the Minister is prepared to go along with the plea that we now have in common, the door is open for him to say that he will look again at the question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During last Thursday's sitting the Minister said that the hon. Member for The Hartlepools
	<br><blockquote><p>"… has also drawn attention to some of the unsatisfactory features of this non-metropolitan
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0509">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>935</span>
county of Teesside. I willingly agree, as he obviously wished, to hold this decision open for further discussion, and I should be glad to look in detail at the matters which he has raised relating to those fringe areas."</p></blockquote>
He then continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I will certainly consider, and we shall have a chance to consider on a later Amendment, the southern boundaries, the Whitby urban and Whitby rural, and a number of the areas on the south side of the Tees which may rightly be included as being a continuation of the built-up area of Teesside. It is well worth having another look at those. On that basis I invite the hon. Gentleman not to press this issue any further but let us come back to it later."</p></blockquote>
I withdrew my Amendment on that undertaking, reserving the right to bring up the matter again on Report. I hope that the Minister may be able to go a little further in the light of that undertaking, and give us a firm assurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to close on a matter raised by the Minister on 20th January, 1972. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The non-metropolitan county of Teesside, as we have drawn it in the Bill, is already in danger of becoming a gigantic extension of Teesside county borough. It already would command 66 per cent. of the population of the non-metropolitan county we have suggested. Excluding the Whitbys would place Teesside in a position of commanding 69 per cent. of the population. If we exclude some of the other areas which he mentioned, such as Great Ayton, it would put Teesside up to 70 per cent. of the whole county."</p></blockquote>
I submit to the Minister that while that is an interesting observation, it is using the statistical or population figure for the wrong purposes. It is not a sufficient argument to say that if we exclude Whitby the population predominance in Teesside would be greater or to exclude Stokesley would make the population base in Teesside more predominant. That is not the argument. The argument here is that we need to look at the urbanised areas of the non-metropolitan county more closely as a cause of the need to get rid of the proposals to place North Yorkshire into Teesside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Teesside is growing. The Minister said in Committee last week:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In 1951, the population was 335,000; in 1961, it was 374,000; that is up 12 per cent. in 10 years; and in 1971, it was 395,000, up another 10 per cent. in 10 years. I think that it will go on growing within its own county borough boundaries because there is sufficient space for it to grow."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee D,</i> 20th January 1972; 	<i>cc.</i> 813–818.]</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>936</span>
But there is a danger—sufficient space to grow where? Into the rural areas? Would that be the consequence? Or should we say, "Here is the evidence of the growth of the urbanised area." Certainly allow it sufficient land to develop, but not so that it conflicts with the interests of the whole of the North Yorkshire area, including the important North Yorkshire National Park.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the hon. Member for Shipley in the North Yorkshire part of his Amendment. I also support the hon. Members who signed the Amendments—with the exclusion of Amendment 40. When I withdrew my Amendments last week, Sir Stephen, which included lines 11 to 25 of Schedule 1, page 192, I thought that that had come to an end with my debate last week—but the hon. Members for Thirsk and Malton, Shipley, Scarborough and Whitley, and Richmond, Yorks., craftily put their names on the end of an Amendment which I thought had been withdrawn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that, because we have worked in common cause, they will allow me to say that that was an unhappy thing to do and I cannot really be associated with that Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend in his closing sentence confirms the view I expressed earlier about the amount of piracy which seems to be going on in respect of these Amendments, and to which we take exception.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We strongly support the establishment of a Teesside authority, which is part of the argument that we ought to be discussing. The case for or against including the North Yorkshire authorities seems to me to rest on the proposition as to whether or not Teesside would be a viable authority if they were excluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are inclined to the view that it would. As I said in an earlier interview, we are inclined to the view that they ought to be excluded. But I must say that I have never come nearer to changing my mind than on hearing the discourse we had from hon. Gentlemen opposite who, not satisfied with dealing with the merits of Teesside and the people whose claim they are upholding in North Yorkshire, whose case we tend to support, willy-nilly are going to determine the future of Durham, Teesside and The Hartlepools in what I can only describe as the most irresponsible manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0510">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>937</span>
It really ought not to be the case that hon. Gentlemen trip round North Yorkshire, entertained extremely well, as one would expect from hospitable Yorkshire—indeed, to judge from the speech of the hon. Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack), the standard of entertainment must have been so overwhelming that he came here still intoxicated by the beatuy of that part of the country which left a lasting impression on him notwithstanding the Yorkshire mist which he encountered while he was there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman was not able to tell us that he carried his visit to the North to the extent of actually visiting The Hartlepools or Teesside. Had he been able to do so, his case would have sounded stronger. At least we should then have known that he was not putting forward a prejudiced case, but was putting his case forward after rational assessment and a visit to the whole area. We know that if the Minister went up there, to judge from what he has told us on previous accounts, he would at least pay all the people in the neighbourhood the courtesy of visiting all their authorities and having a look at the alternatives before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fox</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I realise that the hon. Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell), as a referee, has visited probably every part of the country. Will he accept that these places are known to us in Hartlepool and Middlesbrough? We did not put the Amendment down "willy-nilly". He of all people should know that to put an Amendment down is not to get it accepted, it is the basis of a discussion. And will he accept, in view of his remarks already, that if Teesside has to be expanded it must go in that direction rather than into Yorkshire?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was anxious to spare the Committee a dissertation on my visits to the Middlesbrough football ground. I shall go no further than to say that I went several times when, I am glad to say, we held World Cup matches there. The Government of the day thought it right to build up the importance of the football club there, with remarkable results. So I do know a little about the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was referring to the hon. Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack) who had made a special journey to that part of the world—which I think is in every way commendable, if I may say so—but regretting very
	<span class='label label-info column'>938</span>
much that the journey stopped in Yorkshire when the Amendments he was putting down had such a considerable effect in Durham.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made it abundantly plain that I was speaking specifically to Amendments Nos. 342 to 348 inclusive. I referred to those particularly. I referred to the others in saying that this gave the broad context in which the Minister could discuss the matter. For the record, I have been to Teesside and I do know the area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad of that interruption, because it enables me to get back at once to the short point I want to make. Both hon. Gentlemen concerned have put their names to Amendment No. 503 which has the most serious consequences for local government in Durham, Teesside and Hartlepool. Throughout their speeches they did not address themselves to that Amendment at all. The merits and the substance of that Amendment escaped discussion in the Committee until my hon. Friend the Member for Goole (Dr. Marshall) and my hon. Friend the Member for The Hartlepools (Mr. Leadbitter) spoke. I do not think that on the whole that is good enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I do not wish to take issue with them too much. They will be glad to know that so far as they have gone in concentrating on North Yorkshire they have carried us with them, relatively, provided that the Minister can assure us that the proposition is not absolutely indispensable for the future of Teesside as a whole. I must make that quite clear. If the Minister says today that we cannot have a Teesside authority if we exclude the North Yorkshire authorities, that would be a matter of concern to us. In those circumstances we would wish to go away and think about it, and hope not to be forced into a Division now, because we would hope that the Minister would also think again about what his hon. Friends have said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope that the Minister will say that he absolutely accepts the strength of the local feeling. I have said many times this ought to be one of the most important factors in determining these questions. I do not discount the strong feeling which exists in North Yorkshire. Indeed, I go so far as to say that when feeling of that strength exists, unless there are extremely compelling arguments to the contrary, one
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0511">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>939</span>
ought to heed it. I well understand that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our minds the whole of this point turns on the viability of the creation of the Teesside authority to which we attach very considerable importance. I hope that the Minister is prepared to say that a Teesside authority could be viable, which is the advice given to myself and my hon. Friends in this Committee and in the House. If that is the case, I hope that at any rate those Amendments which wish to main those authorities in North Yorkshire are acceptable to the Committee, and I want to make it clear that in no circumstances shall we be prepared to support Amendment No. 503, or anything like it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are dealing here with three groups of Amendments. There is the group of Amendments which deal with the exclusion of the Whitbys from the Teesside county—Amendments Nos. 239 and 240; the group of Amendments which would exclude certain parishes of Stokesley rural district from the Teesside county—Amendments Nos. 342-348; and there is the major proposition, if I may put it that way, of Amendments Nos. 503-507, which would dismantle the Teesside metropolitan county, at the same time taking into its sphere the other two batches of Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the Minister refer to Teesside as a metropolitan county?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I did, I meant to say the Teesside non-metropolitan county.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I should address my remarks to the major part of the Amendments we have been discussing. They would end the proposal in the Bill for the Teesside non-metropolitan county, dividing it between Durham and North Yorkshire. In population terms, this would mean a doubling of the county of Durham, from 575,000 to 1,137,000. It would be the sixth biggest of the non-metropolitan counties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present county borough of Teesside, if it did become part of a new Durham county of that kind, would account for 35 per cent. of the population of that new county. Durham, as it is at present proposed apart from this Amendment, would take 50.6 per cent., and
	<span class='label label-info column'>940</span>
Teesside some 49.4 per cent.—that is, Teesside, Hartlepool, and the urban districts to the south of Teesside. Teesside itself, as I said, would be about 35 per cent. The result for North Yorkshire would be to increase the population of that county from 597,000 to 631,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are, therefore, no difficulties in the Amendment about the figures. They work out as reasonable counties and reasonable influences within those counties of the various ex-county boroughs and such districts as one can expect within those new counties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ought to go back to the origin of the Teesside county proposal as it appears in the Bill. It was the unitary area put forward by Redcliffe-Maud, and when the Government published their White Paper in February, 1971, the area of the Teesside county then proposed comprised, in addition to the area proposed by Redcliffe-Maud, the major part of the Easington rural district which Redcliffe-Maud had had in a unitary area of Sunderland and East Durham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of representations on the White Paper, Easington was united with Durham by what I have termed on several occasions, the Easington corridor, and a large part of Stokesley rural district was added to North Yorkshire. As a result of these changes the Teesside counties at present proposed in the Bill have a population of 596,000 They consist of Teesside County Borough, which would take 66.3 per cent. of the population of the Teesside County, Hartlepool County Borough which would be 16.3 per cent., and other areas of the proposed county, 17.4 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be seen that there is a heavy predominance of the existing Teesside County Borough in the proposed county. Representations from the Whitby area, and from parishes in Stokesley rural district, indicate quite clearly that they see Teesside as a gigantic extension of the Teesside County Borough, though Teesside councillors have reacted by saying that that is a false picture of them and their borough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of this reaction from the Whitbys and the parishes of Stokesley rural district we have these Amendments, which have been argued so eloquently by both sides of the Committee. Although I was amused by the way in which the hon. Member for The Hartlepools (Mr. Lead-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0512">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>941</span>
bitter) reeled off the roll, finishing modestly with himself at the bottom, he is quite right in saying that there is a unanimity among hon. Members who have spoken and addressed themselves to the problem, for the Whitbys and the Stokesley rural district parishes to be removed from the proposed Teesside County. I accept the strong feeling in those areas to go to North Yorkshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Teesside County Borough in the county which would remain, would not be merely 66.3 per cent. but would increase to 70 per cent. of the borough. For that reason, I find the Amendments to remove the Whitbys and the Stokesley parishes unacceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new county must be looked at as a whole and it is much to be preferred that the Teesside district's share should not be increased. As the hon. Member for The Hartlepools reminded us, Teesside is growing. In that town there will be sufficient space for all the housing and industrial development it needs over the coming years. It is bound to grow, therefore, in its predominance in this Teesside County.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One result of concern among local authorities in the Teesside County has been for them to suggest that Teesside County Borough might be divided into separate districts in the new county, and that several districts be made of Teesside County Borough. I think that this would be nonsense. Having investment put into it as one whole, and having developed it as one county borough it would be an enormous and unnecessary upheaval for it to be split into districts merely to get a balanced county.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are good arguments in favour of abandoning the idea of the Teesside non-metropolitan county as set out in the Bill, and dividing that county between Durham and North Yorkshire. That would meet the wishes of the people in the Whitbys and in the Stokesley parishes who want to be in North Yorkshire, the district containing Teesside would not be left in a county in which it is so dominant, nor would it if put into the Durham County, dominate that County. It would have an important position at the figure of 35 per cent., but would not dominate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other considerations—such as the East Durham coal field—would no longer be divided. The dynamic growth of the town of Teesside, the county borough
	<span class='label label-info column'>942</span>
brought into the Durham County would be of very great value to the development of the County of Durham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am presented, in order to satisfy what I believe to be the right and proper wish of the Whitby and Stokesley parishes, with a County of Teesside which changes its character completely from that which we considered it to start. It may seem to be a small movement of percentage but removing the country areas from the town areas changes the nature altogether. The town and country argument was a strong argument for this County.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the major argument for including the Whitby and Stokesley parishes in Teesside was to produce a balanced county. I readily admit that, but I now feel that that argument is not strong enough to overrule the local wishes of the people; not strong enough to overrule the points of geography and socio-geography which have been produced in the debate; not strong enough to overrule the unanimity of the hon. Members who have spoken and who have taken an interest in this subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I take the logical step from the removal of the Whitby and the Stokesley parishes I am back on the Luton and Plymouth case; the small county dominated by one large town which, in short, is a unitary authority against which we set our face in drawing the Bill. Can I sustain a case for a separate Teesside County in face of that? I think I cannot, but in accordance with what I have tried to do all the way through, in drawing the boundaries and indeed in drawing the whole of this Bill, I must take this again to the local authorities concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the first occasion on which I have expounded this idea in public and I think that it would be quite wrong for the Committee to come to a decision on that right away. I only put it forward as a proposal which I believe is the right solution, and I would put it forward to the local authorities as my solution to the problem of this area. If the Committee will allow me to do what I have done on so many occasions in thinking again about these boundaries—gone back to the local authorities and discussed it with them—I would like to discuss that proposal with them. I would be quite frank that it was a proposal which I was putting to them as what I would like to see, but it would be on a basis of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0513">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>943</span>
consulting them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has listened with more than exceptional care to the points that we have put to him, and he has—as I suspected because of his reactions last Thursday night—gone a little bit further, as I forecast. May I put to him this question? In view of the undertaking that he is giving, will he bear in mind that many of us now quite genuinely—and I suspect very much he himself—are faced with a dilemma in respect of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are all aware of the very pressing legislation which is increasingly impinging upon us in relation to the Bill. If his suggestion is to be put into practice, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman would want it, would he be prepared to meet the hon. Members of the area concerned and discuss this question of time and also something else arising from it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many hon. Gentlemen will have counted the times on which the Minister has said that he is prepared to come back on Report, or that he is prepared to have an open mind. Nevertheless, the Report stage will be very limited. Since I do not want to increase his problems, and in view of the undertaking he has given, which we accept with all the sincerity with which it was given, will he allow the hon. Members in the area concerned to have preliminary talks, without prejudice, about timetabling, and the form that the discussions will take?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This will go out as a consultative letter to the authorities. I shall ask for their views in writing. It would not be right for me to tour the district or receive deputations from local authorities at the stage when hon. Gentlemen are debating this in the Committee. In a week or two, when the local authorities have had a chance to consider this matter—and I should like to do it as quickly as possible—I suggest that hon. Gentlemen concerned should consult me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I express our appreciation for the manner in which the Minister has approached the problem. It is not easy to resolve a situation like this, especially when one's hon. Friends are adamant about their proposals. The Minister has acted in a most responsible
	<span class='label label-info column'>944</span>
way. If I have understood him correctly, he is saying to the Committee that he recognises the force of the argument of my hon. Friends and hon. Gentlemen opposite that, if possible, these local authorities in North Yorkshire should be in the North Yorkshire authority area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Taking up my point, he says that if he does that the consequential situation in respect of Teesside and Durham can be considerable and, in fairness, he doubted whether Teesside would then be a viable authority. This would worry us too—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was not that at all. It will still be a viable authority, and I made the point when I said that I did not want it split up again. It must remain as a Teesside county borough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to have that assurance. From what the Minister said, I take it that, in the course of asking for representations, he will ask for them also from Teesside, the Hartlepools and the Durham County Council. In other words, everyone with a legitimate interest in the proposals before us should be given the opportunity to make representations to him. If that is what the Minister is suggesting, we welcome it. It may be difficult for him to receive deputations of local authorities, but I am sure he will follow the usual practice of Ministers that, if hon. Members wish to see him they may do so, and bring along any people they may wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a difficulty of time scale but we have a few weeks before Report, so I join the Minister in hoping—I assume that he is hoping—that hon.

	<br><blockquote><p>in the rural district of Halstead, the parishes of Alphamstone, Borley, Bulmer, Bures Hamlet, Foxearth, Great Henny, Lamarsh, Liston, Little Henny, Middleton and Pentlow.</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These Amendments, the principal one of which is Amendment No. 221, concern the Government proposals involving the counties of Essex and Suffolk. I hope it will be appropriate to look briefly at an historical picture relating to these two counties, and the long histories which they have, and of the long-established county boundary between Essex and Suffolk, formed by the River Stour and the estuary. I am told that this boundary is of some 1,000 years standing. It was originally between the East Saxons and the East Anglians. It was confirmed in the Domesday Book in 1086.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one looks at the Redcliffe-Maud proposals one sees the balanced judgment which members of that Royal Commission brought to the subject. In volume 1, page 277, the Report says this about the links which North-East Essex has to the south-west:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It has many links with Chelmsford and mid-Essex; Colchester itself … is becoming important as a residential area even for London."</p></blockquote>
The accent there is to the south and the south-west.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This situation was recognised in the White Paper of the previous Administration when they linked their proposals to the eventual decision of Redcliffe-Maud. Although Redcliffe-Maud recognised the southern and south-west look of Colchester, it proposed the unitary area which comprised North-East Essex, East and most of West Suffolk. It was upon
	<span class='label label-info column'>946</span>
that basis that the Socialist Government's proposals resulted in their unitary area No. 44. So there was some conviction in what the Redcliffe-Maud Report said and the actual proposals which it made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think one also needs to look at the principles which lie behind the proposals of the present Government. In the White Paper we, as has already been mentioned in discussions on an earlier Amendment today, were assured that it was the long-established and historic boundaries which were essentially to determine the reform of local government, and a recognition of the long-standing traditions, to which I have referred already. It said that essentially there must be a sound case for an alteration of the existing county boundary system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are proposals in the Bill which change our existing county boundaries, but the accent has been on the fact that there must be a good and substantial reason. Emphasis was put upon the recognition of existing loyalties to the fabric of our society. The extent to which these are based on counties surprises many of us. Even new counties seem quickly to adopt new loyalties. All of us, I think, would subscribe to this view. That was why many of us doubted the root-and-branch reform recommended by Redcliffe-Maud and the proposals involved in the unitary type of authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper visualised that Essex should be retained in its present form. Only on Second Reading was there a clear indication that the Government had changed their mind, feeling that the northeastern part of Essex should be included with a new county, formed by East and West Suffolk. I refer the Committee to the OFFICIAL REPORT of 16th November last for the Secretary of State's explanation of how this decision had been reached:
	<br><blockquote><p>"One proposal which is dramatically different from the previous proposal is that concerning the transfer of North-East Essex to Suffolk. I must explain why this transfer was made. The reason was that, of all the suggestions made to us, this one alone was supported by six out of the nine local authorities concerned … These six authorities represent the vast majority of the population of that area.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>This suggestion was made not by my Department but by the local authorities concerned."</p></blockquote>
The Secretary of State further said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I shall take a great interest in the views expressed as a result of the publication of this proposal. All I want to do is to ensure that this area is dealt with in a way which meets
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0515">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>947</span>
the wishes of the people there … It is understandable and right that my Department should endeavour to meet their wishes."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 16th November, 1971; Vol. 876, 	<i>cc.</i> 236–237.]</p></blockquote>
The wishes that were expressed prior to the publication of the Bill were based on decisions of varying local authorities. Those in favour of the transfer to Suffolk were the urban districts of Brightlingsea, West Mersea and Wivenhoe, and the two Rural District Councils of Lexden and Winstree and Tendring. Three authorities—Harwich Borough Council, the Clacton U.D.C. and the Frinton and Walton U.D.C.—were in favour of remaining in Essex. Colchester Borough Council were primarily in favour of a separate county for North-East Essex. However, they accepted as second-best a transfer to Suffolk. That is clearly the basis upon which the Government made its representations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation involved a shift of 18.49 per cent. of the area of Essex into the county to the north, and approximately 200,000 people. After the Second Reading, Colchester Borough Council re-considered the matter. Voting figures on the second discussion were that 23 aldermen and councillors were in favour of remaining in Essex and eight were against. Thus a majority of 15 were clearly in favour of Colchester remaining in Essex. This is the fundamental change of opinion which the Government, quite properly, will take into account in reaching a final decision with respect to the two counties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn from an expression of opinion of locally-elected members to the varying authorities, and wish briefly to refer to a number of functional considerations, and to the effects which the change would have. For example, as far as strategic planning is concerned, it is not only a breach of counties but also of the regional planning councils' arrangements. North-East Essex would thus be shifted out of the area of the South-East Regional Planning Council into the Eastern Area Planning Council. I have no doubt that very many significant and far-reaching proposals have been made by these two regional planning authorities affecting this north-eastern part of Essex. It will alter some of the planning concepts which have been considered and decisions which have been reached in the planning of the south-east regional economic plan-

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I dealt briefly with the broad planning considerations, as I propose to deal with that aspect of local administration only in regional terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to education, I recognise the excellent facilities which the present county of Essex provides for residential special schools. No fewer than four of these—Ogilvie School, Clacton, for delicate junior boys and girls; the Homestead School, Langham, where there is accommodation for 45 maladjusted senior boys; a senior type of school, with the same numbers, The Heath School, Stanway, and the D'Arcy School, St. Osyth, to be reopened in September for semi-maladjusted boys—are in the north-eastern area of Essex, which, under the Government's proposals, is to be put into Suffolk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New Essex will be left with one school, for junior maladjusted children, and one other school partially used for senior maladjusted children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the event of these proposals going forward, one can foresee tremendous pressure on the new Essex local education authority for this type of accommodation. In the county of Essex, at present, there are no fewer than 155 pupils attending out-of-county schools for maladjusted children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The North-East Essex Technical College, in Colchester, is a keystone of the present county's policy. The Essex County Council has spent about £900,000 on lands and building in developing that college in the past six years alone, and almost £1½ million since the 1950s. In the view of the Essex County Council, and the unanimous opinion of all the principals, the college's severance from the close association which it has enjoyed with the other seven Essex colleges will be harmful to the county's educational services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Coming to the University of Essex, Lord Butler, the Chancellor, is quoted as having said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I shall work with the county to restore justice and reverse this extraordinary decision."</p></blockquote>
I am sure he is referring there to the proposals in the Bill.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0516">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>949</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"I shall remain in the battlefield until we have won."</p></blockquote>
The Vice-Chancellor of that University is on record as saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I should deeply deplore any administrative changes which would weaken the ties between the University and the County whose name it bears and which has been so generous in its support."</p></blockquote>
Also I quote the hon. Member for Thurrock (Mr. Delargy), whose name appears on the Amendment with those of my hon. Friends the Members for Essex, South-East (Mr. Braine) and Chigwell (Mr. Biggs-Davison). The hon. Member for Thurrock is on record as having said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is absurd of the Government to propose that Suffolk should take over North East Essex which included the ancient Borough of Colchester, the oldest town in the country and the seat of Essex University."</p></blockquote>
In educational terms, therefore, I think that at all levels the disturbance which would follow the Government's proposals in the Bill is a genuine cause of deep concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to finance, we have the Green Paper, that discussion document, and we have yet to have any definitive proposals on the reorganisation of local government finance. The resources of these two authorities are substantially different from another, and this is perhaps most clearly revealed when one looks at the figures for rateable value per head of the population in 1971.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For North-East Essex, the area in question, the rateable value per head is £40.6, and for Suffolk, excluding the North-East Essex area, £38.30. The Suffolk as proposed in the Bill, that is the enlarged county, has £39, and Essex as proposed in the Bill, £50.60. So that Essex clearly has and will continue to have, in any event, a substantially wider resource base than Suffolk, but these figures show that the new Suffolk benefits very little from the addition of this area of North-East Essex. Suffolk clearly is a county of rather more limited resources, but it has the benefit of the equalisation grant procedure and the rates for grant regulations which deal with these circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think, then, that there are substantial grounds one way or the other in that respect. But the current Essex county rate of 54.1p in the £ compares with 56p for East Suffolk and 58p in West Suffolk, so that the rate poundage is higher in the two Suffolk counties than in the existing Essex county.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>950</span>
It has been the Essex County Council's policy, according to need, to ensure the provision of the same standard of county services throughout its area, notwithstanding that the ratepayers of North-East Essex have contributed on average substantially less per head than those in the remainder of the county.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To turn to the health services, here again there is cause for concern in the context of the Government's proposals. The National Health Services Executive Council for Essex is administered from Clacton-on-Sea. It is rather a strange location, right on the perimeter of the existing county, and if there are to be changes they would affect that headquarters and the staff there. There are all the uncertainties for the staff in local government generally, without the additions of the uncertainties that would be brought into this situation in the light of the Government's proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that it is a firm Government policy decision that the new area health authorities shall be coterminous with their respective county or metropolitan district local government authorities outside London. It is further envisaged that within each area health authority there will be health districts based upon district general hospitals. Here the position in North-East Essex is that it provides a natural district with the district general hospital based on Colchester. There are also plans for a new hospital to be built.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of transferring the Harwich constituency to Suffolk, whilst leaving Colchester in Essex, would create a health district without a district general hospital. The Colchester hospital would be sitting, not only on the extreme periphery of a health area, but also on the periphery of a health region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have received a letter from Mr. Shaw, the Clerk of the Council of the National Health Service Executive Council for Essex and a further letter has reached me from Dr. Brian Collins, who is the honorary secretary of the Medical Staff Committee of Harwich Hospital. Dr. Collins says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"My Committee has asked me to write expressing their strong disapproval of this proposal."—</p></blockquote>
that is, the proposal in the Bill—
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is felt that this would leave us in a geographical entity without access to a General
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0517">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>951</span>
Hospital … All our consultant cover comes from Colchester and over the years we have worked up a good relationship between our General Practitioner Hospital and the Consultants in Colchester."</p></blockquote>
Looking at the services, it can be clearly seen that the Government proposals would lead to a great necessity for a reorientation of services. I do not suggest that this reorganisation is beyond the wit of the health authorities, but I think it strikes at the existing loyalties to the present institutions. As I said in my opening remarks, I understand that the Government's policy is not—except where it can be proved necessary—to bring about change for any other reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principal aspect of this matter which weighs with me is the democratic expression by elected members with regard to the Government's proposals. With the Colchester Borough Council's revised decision, in which they oppose the Government's provisions in the Bill, we see something like 154,500 electors, represented by members of varying authorities, against the Government proposals, and about 65,000 only in favour of them. In democratic terms, therefore, by the decision of the elected representatives on nine local authorities, the expression is overwhelmingly against the proposals in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the context that reform proposals will interfere with existing boundaries, and in the light of the Government's policies that it is only where the necessity for change can be demonstrated beyond doubt, now that we have seen a revised expression of opinion I hope that the Government will find it possible to revert to their White Paper proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Daniel Awdry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been approached by my hon. Friend the Member for Harwich (Mr. Ridsdale), who, although not a member of the Committee, has a constituency affected by the Amendments. I have been asked to point out to the Minister that the Essex County Council has mounted a massive publicity campaign organised by a public relations firm. There is no criticism of that, because they have done a good job on the publicity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the Minister announces a final decision I hope that he will consider the further observations put forward by the East Suffolk County Council, the West Suffolk County Council, and the Ipswich
	<span class='label label-info column'>952</span>
County Borough Council. Those observations were published yesterday, and it is only fair to the people of Harwich that matters put forward in this document should be considered with as much care as the arguments put forward by the county council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In particular, the document makes some fairly strong statements about the case put forward by the Essex County Council. Under the heading, "Fallacious Publicity" it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The publicity campaign mounted by a public relations firm paid by the Essex County Council has included unfortunate and misleading references…"</p></blockquote>
It goes on to deal in careful detail with some of the points so well prepared by my hon. Friend who moved the Amendment. We live in an age of pressure groups and protest meetings, and I should hate to feel that the Government could be pushed so completely by a campaign of this kind. Consequently, I ask the Minister to say whether he is prepared to give consideration to the views of the Suffolk County Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>8.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer to Amendment No. 353. It concerns an entirely separate proposal to transfer 11 parishes of the present rural district of Halstead, now in Essex, to the proposed County of Suffolk. They are small hamlets or villages in the valley of the River Stour, and they look towards the town of Sudbury as their main centre. It is generally recognised these days that county boroughs are not necessarily better placed along rivers. Indeed, rivers join areas rather than separate them. The map shows that by including these parishes in Suffolk a smoother boundary would be achieved between Suffolk and Essex than is now proposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be for the convenience of the Committee if I intervened after the powerful speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Northants, South (Mr. Arthur Jones), in which he set out strong arguments for retaining North-East Essex in Essex. He argued for retention of the traditional county boundaries, long established; the links between North-East of Essex and the South—Chelmsford and London—and the important Essex county services in the North-East of Essex. He referred to the hospital service, the education service, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I attended in this area to discuss
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0518">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>953</span>
the matter with local authorities I thought that the reasons then given for North-East of Essex being made part of Suffolk County were not strong. The arguments of Radcliffe-Maud—that one would equalise the population resources of the two counties by moving North-East Essex into Suffolk, and the arguments about the East Anglian spirit of those in North-East Essex—were put forward with great force at the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that I had even better arguments for moving North-East Essex into Suffolk. I was very keen on seeing the estuary of the Stour and the Orwell, Harwich Harbour and the Haven ports, all under one authority. If we put North-East Essex in Suffolk we could see the development of that area as a whole. Not only the Haven ports of Ipswich, Parkeston, Harwich and Felixstowe but the Stour Valley itself, in which is situated the great Dedham Vale—an area of outstanding beauty—is cut by the boundary between the two counties. It would have been nice to see that in one area. After all, we have county boundaries running even across national parks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I considered the authorities which are managing the estuary—the conservancy board, and so on—I found that this could not be a basic factor in the movement of North-East Essex into Suffolk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final factor, as the Secretary of State said in the Second Reading debate, was that at that time the local authorities in North-East Essex were overwhelmingly in favour of moving into Suffolk. I shall not go through the figures in detail, but at that time the total population in favour of the transfer was 154,534 and those against only 65,265. Since that debate, and since the Bill became known to the authorities in that area, there has been a change of mind. The figures have reversed in the last few weeks to only 78,389 for the transfer and 141,410 against.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One might say that that was due to a massive publicity exercise by Essex, but I cannot ignore those figures. The Secretary of State said that the fact that Colchester and Brightlingsea wanted to go into Suffolk was the final factor which made us put that in the Bill. When I find this complete change of mind I must take notice of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances I must advise the Committee to accept the Amendment
	<span class='label label-info column'>954</span>
moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Northants, South, moving this part of North-East Essex back into Essex as the local authorities there wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question raised in the Amendment of the hon. Member for Goole (Dr. Marshall), it might have been reasonable to move parts of the Halstead rural district into Suffolk if we had also been moving into Suffolk the part of North-East Essex of which I have been talking. I think now that it would be quite unreasonable to touch the Halstead rural district. Indeed, the rural district itself does not want to be cut into pieces, and does not wish for any move.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, I am deeply sorry that there has been mudslinging between the two counties as a result of what we did in the Bill. It is essential that the two counties work together in the future to improve the estuary, the Stour valley, the Orwell, and, particularly, the haven ports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a great future for the area with the Common Market. It is one of the main gateways into and out of the country, with passages from the haven ports into the Midlands, the North-West, to the industries, the production of goods and so on, which will be moving from this country into Europe. I hope that the counties will forget the dispute which we perhaps unwittingly encouraged between them because of the way in which we drew the Bill, and will get together to develop the area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blenkinsop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister not agree that this is another obvious case where we must have some declared regional facilities and policy to deal with precisely the kind of point that he has mentioned?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, this is being dealt with very thoroughly in the regional survey of the area. I assure the hon. Gentleman that I am looking at this. At the moment the regional boundary between our economic planning councils is the boundary of those two counties. We need to look at that in order to get the development of the area all together.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have great sympathy for the Minister. He was trying to solve something that Alfred the Great and Guthrum tried to do about 1,300 years ago with a marked lack of success. At least it has enabled us to see that there
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0519">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>955</span>
are strong links with the area in which we live and the counties. I think that my hon. Friend is right. Eventually we hope that there will be good association in the regions. County history and influence remain strong, and that is no bad thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We on this side of the Committee join the Minister in congratulating the hon. Member for Northants, South (Mr. Arthur Jones) on a powerful speech, and those hon. Gentlemen in Essex, including my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock (Mr. Delargy), who fought such a good and long campaign.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I offer my thanks to the Minister for giving favourable consideration to the Amendment. I also offer the thanks of my hon. Friends and the hon. Member for Thurrock (Mr. Delargy) whose name appears on the Amendment. I am sure that he is right, and in his wisdom has given good advice to the counties of Essex and Suffolk in insisting that they should forget the differences that have arisen because of the White Paper and the subsequent Government proposals in the Bill. I trust that we shall see his hopes fully realised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Roper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 428, in page 189, line 30, at end insert:

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this Amendment we can take Amendment No. 429, in page 192, line 39, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"except the areas in Hampshire."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Amendment has not occupied our postbags to the same extent as have the last two groups. However, I hope that the Minister will be as attentive to it as he has been to those dealing with Teesside and North Yorkshire and, more recently, part of the county of Essex. The Amendment would detach four authorities in the south-east corner of Wiltshire and put them into Hampshire, with which it is argued they have closer links.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move the Amendment with some trepidation, in view of the fact that there are two hon. Members from Wiltshire
	<span class='label label-info column'>956</span>
constituencies on the opposite side of the Committee, who no doubt have strong protective instincts about this part of their county. Nonetheless, I think that they will recognise that Salisbury has much stronger local ties with Southampton than with the remaining parts of the county of Wiltshire. It is only 23 miles from Southampton, and there is the good A36 trunk road linking Salisbury and the surrounding areas to Southampton. It is over 40 miles from Trowbridge, which is the present administrative capital of the county of Wiltshire, and hon. Members for the Wiltshire constituencies will confirm that those roads are not of the best quality, for all the route, from Salisbury to Trowbridge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are much better public transport facilities between Salisbury and Southampton than between Salisbury and Swindon. There is a half-hourly bus service to Southampton, taking 75 minutes, whereas the Swindon bus—the only really satisfactory bus service going northward—is a two-hourly service, the last bus leaving at 8 o'clock. On the other hand, there is a bus service into Southampton until well after 10 o'clock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, there is the continuing rail link between Salisbury and Southampton A number of people travel daily from the Salisbury area to work in Southampton. Salisbury has its own cultural and sporting activities, of which it is justly proud. Nevertheless, people tend to travel from parts of Wiltshire into Southampton, not only to participate in sporting activities—to which my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) would no doubt refer if he were present—but to shop and take part in various other activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus, there is a definite community of interest between the south-eastern corner of Wiltshire and the county of Hampshire—and Southampton in particular. The newspaper, 	<i>The Southern Evening Echo,</i> is based on Southampton. The hospital board is based in Winchester. The links are from Salisbury across to the Hampshire area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also true that most of the large public utilities which serve the whole of the south-east corner of Wiltshire are based upon Southampton—including the gas board, the electricity board and the telephone service. The Post Office works out from Southampton, as does the A.A.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0520">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>957</span>
and other important utilities. Thus, as Mr. Senior perceptively pointed out in his minority report to Redcliffe-Maud, the large and rapid development taking place in the Southampton corridor, together with the prospect of a substantial upgrading of Southampton as a regional centre, seems likely to pull the now "semidetached" Salisbury district fully into the sphere of influence of Southampton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
8.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus, in view of the apparently strong community of interests—in terms of occupation, shopping and other matters—between Southampton and the south-east corner of Wiltshire, I hope that the Minister will reconsider the possibility of drawing more logical boundaries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Awdry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could hardly believe my eyes when I read the Amendment. I can quite understand the trepidation with which any hon. Member would move that Salisbury, of all places, should be detached from Wiltshire. For centuries Salisbury has been the centre of Wiltshire—the cathedral town and the county town. No Wiltshireman would agree to the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one in Wiltshire would be in favour of this suggestion. No local authority wants it. The county council is bitterly opposed to it. I was born in Wiltshire, as was my hon. Friend the Member for Devizes (Mr. Charles Morrison). I ask the Minister to oppose the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Morrison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I strongly support my hon. Friend the Member for Chippenham (Mr. Awdry). As in the case of the previous Amendment, concerning Wiltshire, hon. Gentlemen opposite have not had an opportunity of studying the situation on the ground. If the point arose again during the course of the Bill, my hon. Friend and I would go so far as to invite some hon. Gentlemen opposite to come to Wiltshire, after which I feel sure they would support our view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cocks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the mover of the previous Amendment concerning Wiltshire, I took very much to heart the remarks made by the hon. Member for Dorset, South (Mr. Evelyn King) on the subject of consulting local opinion.

I had dinner with one of the local electorate of the Mere and Didsbury rural district. He told me that he fully embraced the terms of my Amendment—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>958</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are not discussing the hon. Gentleman's Amendment, which was disposed of some time ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cocks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that, Sir Stephen. I say only that strong undercurrents of local opinion in all these areas may not yet have been tapped. I believe that in the moving of these Amendments, we are performing a public service. I make no further comment except to say that there does appear to be some discrimination in the provision of the Ordnance Survey maps. I am unable to obtain a one-inch map of this area, whereas I see that the Minister is not only supplied with one-inch maps, but they are covered with various transparencies, showing all relevant points that should be brought out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure what the hon. Member wants a one-inch map for when this Amendment proposes to remove one quarter of the total land area of Wiltshire and put it into Hampshire. I should have thought that the detail was less important than the global arguments with which we are confronted. How is it that my hon. Friends know that in fact I am going to make these pronouncements on their side I have no concept whatsoever, because certainly I have had no conversation with them about the matter until this speech I make now. On the weight of argument which has been presented to us, it seems that the hon. Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper) is perhaps not on the normal coherent, intellectual case that he likes to advocate with such skill in this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may well be a whole range of community of interest between the people of this area and those in the communities that lie south but this is a point lost entirely upon the people of this area, none of whom apparently is prepared to support this Amendment. If I could move matters from the very important argument of local communities into the more rarified atmosphere of the Redcliffe-Maud Commission, this very argument was presented to the Commission and it was not prepared to accept that the argument was sufficient to justify this part of Wiltshire finding its way into Hampshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another balancing argument, if one were necessary in this case, is that one
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0521">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>959</span>
would be taking substantial population—about 90,000 people—from a relatively small county and transferring it into what is already an extremely large county. Wiltshire as it is now designed has some 486,000 people, whilst Hampshire has 1,466,000 people. So one is not looking for population shifts from one to the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I ask the hon. Member for Farnworth, although I appreciate his energy and enthusiasm in putting this case to the Committee, to consider whether it would not be best to allow us to proceed without asking the Committee to divide on this issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The name of Malvernshire came as a complete shock to the people of Worcestershire when the Bill was published. It was not foreshadowed in any way in any of the consultative documents which were presented on any previous occasion. It had not been mooted among the people of Worcestershire. It was universally condemned and as a result of a survey conducted by the Worcestershire County Council the name Hereford and Worcester has emerged as the most popular choice amongst people in Worcestershire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second choice—Wyvern—was a concoction which is quite popular amongst people in the county but came well down second. The name of Malvernshire attracted the votes of only two per cent. of those surveyed. I accept that the Government's Amendment is tidier alphabetically in that it puts Hereford and Worcester in the right place in the Schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only question which remains on this topic—and I would be grateful if the Minister would enlighten me about this—is where the name "Malvernshire" ever came from. As far as I have been able to discover it was originally mooted by the Borough of Halesowen. I do not know whether the Minister can confirm that. If he does, there is a certain amount of irony in the situation. Halesowen was anxious to remain in Worcestershire. Worcestershire County Council was anxious to retain the Borough of Halesowen in their county. The Government have decreed otherwise. It would be ironic if the borough of Halesowen, which is not in any circumstances to be part of the counties of Worcestershire, Hereford or Worcester, were responsible for the concoction of "Malvernshire"—Nevertheless, the Worcestershire County Council accepts the present situation in

	<span class='label label-info column'>961</span>
regard to the union of Worcester and Hereford.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful, Sir Stephen, for your permission to discuss Amendments Nos. 513 and 514, even though they were tabled only yesterday. At an earlier stage in our proceedings I explained to the counties of Hereford and Worcester that I believed that the interests of North Worcestershire were so dissimilar to the rest of Hereford and Worcester that North Worcestershire should and could stand alone. I gave you notice at the time, Sir Stephen, that I was considering Amendments which establish a new county council for North Worcestershire that I might move at a later date. I have not tabled those Amendments because I have been persuaded by the representatives of Herefordshire to table these two Amendments instead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These Amendments maintain the present separation of Hereford and Worcester. I have had a letter from the Hereford City Council. I understand that it has written letters to all Members of Parliament of Herefordshire and Worcestershire, asking them to table these Amendments. I received this letter only two weeks ago, and a meeting took place on Sunday. Neither I nor the people of Herefordshire thought that this subject would be discussed this week. At best we thought we might be discussing it on Thursday, and I tabled the Amendments yesterday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Herefordshire County Council and the Hereford City Council have acted with remarkable promptness. As soon as I told them that this subject would possibly be discussed at the end of the week, they prepared a complete brief for every member of the Committee, and these were brought up by special messenger this afternoon. I apologise to the Committee for the previous lack of information but I hope that hon. Members will understand why. I arranged for the copies for the Ministers to be put on the letter board, and the other copies were distributed to back-bench members of the Committee through the usual channels.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman accept that we have really had no time at all in which to study these documents, however powerful the case may be?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely. I am sure that the City Council of Hereford would wish me to apologise on its behalf. I hope
	<span class='label label-info column'>962</span>
that you, Sir Stephen, and the members of Committee appreciate that I, too, was only appraised of the situation on Sunday afternoon, and that I received this brief only an hour before other hon. Members. Any weakness in the case I present this evening will, I hope, be attributed either to my own lack of skill or to the inadequate time in which I have had to study the case, rather than to the case itself, which is the case of the people of Herefordshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a covering letter with the documents which have been distributed, and I hope that this makes it clear. I was concerned, when I met the representatives of Hereford and Herefordshire on Sunday afternoon, to discover that at no stage had they had any discussions with the hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Graham Page) and the hon. Member for Tavistock (Mr. Michael Heseltine).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was extremely surprised to be given that information, because my impression from our earlier proceedings was that the hon. Gentleman had taken a great deal of trouble to visit all parts of the country where there was concern or opposition to the Government's proposals. It may be that I have been misinformed, but that is the information that I was given by people in Hereford and Herefordshire. They were most upset to understand that the Ministers had actually visited other parts of the country but had never been to the county of Herefordshire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cocks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not in a helicopter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I understand that they have not flown over it or visited it at all. It is extremely serious. Although they have not had much time, they have not had the amount of paper that we had on Essex or Great Ayton. We are discussing a county, not a parish. It is extremely serious that, apparently, the Ministers have not taken the trouble to visit the councils of the county, either the county council or the city or the district councils, in order to appreciate their feelings. Frankly, I think there is some degree of discourtesy in this, and I hope that the Ministers will explain why it happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack) referred to a delegation of which he was a member which visited Great Ayton. Great Ayton is a parish where there is tremendous feeling about
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0523">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>963</span>
which county they should belong to, yet here is a whole county which has not been visited by any delegation at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is entirely their own fault. We were invited to Great Ayton. We did not just decide to go. It was up to Herefordshire to invite members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.0 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the representatives of Herefordshire will take note of what the hon. Gentleman says. It is fair to say, however, that they did ask to send a delegation to the Secretary of State; and I understand that that invitation was not extended to them. A meeting was arranged at the House of Commons by the two Members of Parliament for Herefordshire, and the Secretary of State visited this meeting for 15 to 20 minutes. That is the extent of consultations with the Department of the Environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I go any further perhaps I should explain my own connection. I am the Member of Parliament for Bromsgrove, which is in the northern part of Worcestershire. As I have told hon. Gentlemen on several occasions, I was born and brought up in Worcestershire, but I can claim to speak for Herefordshire too. Although my family has lived in Worcestershire since about the time of the Napoleonic Wars, the family has lived in Herefordshire for far longer. So my connections with Herefordshire, if not remote, are at least long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure whether Ordnance Survey maps are available. If not, it is a great pity, because it is most important to my case, and I shall have to ask the hon. Members to look at the maps I shall hold up. Maps are available of the local government boundaries. I see that the Minister has one, and I have one. I do not know whether they are distributed widely, but in case they are, let me point out at once that there is a mistake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A boundary which would be retained by my two Amendments is drawn in red on this map. Unfortunately, the boundary has been drawn in the wrong place because it transfers the rural district of Tenbury into Herefordshire. It has never been in Herefordshire. A case for transferring the rural district of Tenbury to Herefordshire might well be considered by the Boundary Commission, but it
	<span class='label label-info column'>964</span>
would not be achieved by my Amendments. Tenbury rural district would remain part of Worcestershire, where it has always been to the best of my knowledge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have commented on the lack of Ordnance Survey maps. I believe that the counties of Herefordshire and Worcestershire are little known in the House. If the hon. Gentlemen will look closely at the map they will see the relative positions of Worcestershire and Herefordshire. I have had to do this only because of the Government's inefficiency in not providing maps.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>An hon. Member</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Parsimony.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I want to hear the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are debating the future of a particular county. I appreciate that the Government did not have much notice of these Amendments, but they were notified earlier today, and maps are readily available from Her Majesty's Stationery Office and could have been provided for hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If hon. Members look at the map they will see where Herefordshire lies. The two counties are separated by the Glamorgan Hills; To the north of Herefordshire lies the county of Shropshire, with a series of hills. To the east is Worcestershire, divided by the range of the Malverns. To the south are Gloucestershire and Monmouthshire. There is the Forest of Dean, with its natural boundaries. To the west lies Brecon and Radnorshire—a point which I ask members of the Committee to bear in mind, because I shall return to it later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The county of Herefordshire is basically a lowland area surrounded by hills and mountains, except to the south-east, where there is the outlet of the rivers. To the west there are the Black Mountains, and to the east the Malvern Hills, which rise to a height of over 1,000 feet. Although that may not sound very much, anyone who has travelled along the M5 motorway will appreciate the way the range of the Malvern Hills shut out the countryside and the difficulty presented to travellers crossing from Worcestershire into Herefordshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The county of Hereford is traversed by the River Wye, which rises in the west, runs through the city of Hereford, travelling in an easterly direction, and then
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0524">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>965</span>
turns south to run to the sea. The county of Herefordshire is basically a rural county. It has excellent agricultural soil, and is famous for its orchards and its hops. It is second only to Kent in the quantity of hops produced, and second to none in quality. It is also famous for its beef cattle. They stamp the county as a rural and agricultural county, four-fifths of which is cultivated land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Industry in the county tends to be oriented towards agriculture. There is the manufacture of agricultural implements, cider-making, fruit canning, and jam making—all of which are agriculturally-connected industries, very different from the situation in North Worcestershire, which I represent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The River Wye used to be the frontier between Wales and England and the county of Hereford was famous in history for the battles between the Welsh and the English. Offa's Dyke, which runs across the county, was constructed to keep the Welsh out or the English in—I am not sure which—and Herefordshire was mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle in the eleventh century. It saw battles through the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. It saw the Wars of the Roses, and it was the scene of battles in the Civil War.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then Herefordshire lapsed from sight—which was Herefordshire's great good fortune, because Herefordshire is unique. It is a jewel of a county. It is different, and special. The architecture of Herefordshire—its black and white houses—remind me very much of what Worcestershire must have been like 50 years ago. But Worcestershire today is changing rapidly. It is essential for Members to understand that. Worcestershire is changing, but Herefordshire has not changed, and does not want to change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a lighter note—the hon. Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack) referred to the village of Great Ayton as Captain Cook's birthplace. Herefordshire's claim to history is that it was the birthplace of Nell Gwynne, but it also gave the country Dick Whittington. It has never provided soldiers and sailors—nor, I think it fair to say, international statesmen. It has been a quiet and very peaceful county, where the people have enjoyed their isolation from the rest of England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arguments for retaining Herefordshire as a county council are first, that
	<span class='label label-info column'>966</span>
there is this tremendous dissimilarity between Herefordshire and Worcestershire, and indeed, between Herefordshire and the rest of the West Midlands. There are some similarities between Herefordshire and the southern part of the county of Worcestershire, but Worcestershire is changing very rapidly. It has already changed in the northern part, which I represent, and even in the south—particularly the City of Worcester—there has been a great increase in manufacturing. The county—as a result of the motorway, no doubt—is becoming much more influenced by the conurbation than Herefordshire has ever been, or I hope, will ever be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
North Worcestershire has a new town at Redditch. It is a growing area. We hope for a population boom in North Worcestershire, which is a semi-industrial area. Of course, we still have our farmers, and we have orchards in my own constituency, but, the character of North Worcestershire is semi-industrial, the character of South Worcestershire is semi-rural and the character of Herefordshire is entirely rural. That is the difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trends are to accelerate these facets. The trend in North Worcestershire is towards more industry. There is no comparable trend towards industry in Herefordshire. The regional studies that have been completed for the West Midlands describe Herefordshire as part of the "rural West". One rural study a few years ago pointed out that there was closer affinity between Herefordshire and parts of Wales than between Herefordshire and the rest of the West Midlands. On the other hand, Worcestershire is labelled as part of the central division. There is a difference. The Malverns are more than a physical boundary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Herefordshire there is a fear of Worcester. That may sound incredible to members of the Committee, but I would ask them to cast their minds back to last week's debate on the City of Birmingham and Chelmsley Wood. The relationship is similar. The fear of domination by Birmingham which exists there is reflected in Herefordshire, where they fear the City of Worcester. It may sound strange to members of the Committee, but it is true. Herefordshire sees the proposal as a takeover. The draft proposals from the Home Office for representation on the new county council would give Herefordshire
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0525">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>967</span>
23 councillors. Worcestershire would have 57. That is an equitable division if there is to be a union between Hereford and Worcester because the population of Worcestershire is so much greater than the population of Hereford. Statistics show that the population of Worcester in relation to Herefordshire is greater at 3 to 1 in representation on the county council according to the draft proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We understand that they are only draft proposals, and that even if they come into existence they will only apply to the first elections to the county council, and that later we shall have new electoral divisions. However, the people of Herefordshire fear, rightly in my opinion, that they will eventually have fewer than 23 councillors. The geographical centre of the new county will be the Malvern Hills, but the county council cannot meet on top of the Malvern Hills. The centre of the population of Hereford and Worcester is near Worcester. The north of Worcestershire is growing at a tremendous rate, and the population centre will move further away from Hereford as each year passes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Worcestershire County Council has been somewhat tactless. I can understand the haste, and the reasons for wanting to get things settled, and why the council would feel it necessary to decide where the new centre of the county of Hereford and Worcester should be located. But it is tactless. It has rubbed into the people of Herefordshire that the centre is to be north of Worcester, and not between Worcester and Hereford. If it were between Worcester and Hereford that would be extremely inconvenient for the people whom I represent in North Worcestershire. From an objective point of view the population centre is north of Worcester, but for the people of Herefordshire that is of little comfort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the third argument for retaining the county of Herefordshire—communications. Map 3 of the green document distributed by the county council shows clearly the communications existing in Hereford and Worcester. There are two focal points. Communications radiate from Hereford and from Worcester, but they do not go between the two places. It is not surprising, because of the range of Malvern Hills in between, but there are the two individual, separate centres of Hereford and Worcester. The City of Hereford, as can be seen from the map,
	<span class='label label-info column'>968</span>
is a focal point for the County of Herefordshire. It is relatively easy for everybody in Herefordshire to reach Hereford. It is a centre for Herefordshire in the full meaning of the word. Similarly, Worcester is at the centre of Worcestershire; it does not have the same relationship to its county as the City of Hereford has to the county of Herefordshire, but nevertheless it is relatively easy for the people of Worcestershire to reach Worcester.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the trunk roads are north-south. This can perhaps be better seen on map 5 in the brochure, which I realise hon. Members will not have had time to study. That map shows how communications run from north to south instead of from east to west between the two towns of Hereford and Worcester.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Herefordshire, the A49 runs from Shrewsbury through Ludlow into the county of Herefordshire. It goes through Leominster and then to Hereford; and then it runs out of the county to Monmouth. In Worcestershire, we are now crossed by the M5 motorway, which again is a north-south communications line. It is true—and I am sure the Minister would point it out if I did not—that there is what we call the Ross Spur, which runs from M5 towards Wales—towards Ross-on-Wye; but that is of no use to the people of Herefordshire in general to communicate with Worcestershire. The population of Ross-on-Wye urban district, plus the population of Ross and Whitchurch rural district, is only 18,000. The population of the city of Hereford and its rural district is 68,000 people. Half the population of Herefordshire live near the county city. It is of no use to them having the Ross Spur as a communication with Worcestershire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The route to Worcester is over the Malvern Hills, not by the Ross Spur. Any member of the Committee can see, looking at the map, how inconvenient it would be for the people of Herefordshire, with the centre of a new county located, as it must be. at or near Worcester. The furthest part in the west of Herefordshire is Kington. It takes half an hour to drive from Kington to the City of Hereford. It would take an hour and a half for those people to drive from Kington to the City of Worcester. This is not a light point, because it affects, not only the feeling of the community of interest, but the local government of Hereford and Worcester.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0526">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>969</span>
It affects the people who can serve as county councillors. It would be a big sacrifice for someone who lives at Kington to be a county councillor on the new authority. They would lose three hours in travelling time alone every time they attend a meeting at the city of Worcester.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, there was a review of local government in the West Midlands 10 years ago, and this is quoted on page 5 of the brief that has been distributed to members of the Committee. In that review the Local Government Commission said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… we think that a combined county administered from Worcester would be very inconvenient for most of the councillors, officers and ratepayers of Herefordshire. On the whole our conclusion has been that a single county covering the whole of this area would be so much less convenient than the two present counties as to outweigh the probable gain in effectiveness."</p></blockquote>
This is a major part of Herefordshire's case. It is grossly inconvenient to unite Hereford and Worcester.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fourth argument advanced by the county of Herefordshire would be described as sentiment and tradition. It was described in those terms by Ministers this morning when we were discussing the Amendments affecting Suffolk and Cambridgeshire. I would describe it differently. I would say that what we are discussing is what people want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people of Herefordshire are not convinced that a takeover will mean an improvement in services, which can be the only just argument for uniting those two counties. The County Council of Herefordshire are opposed to the union. The City Council of Hereford is opposed to the union. I understand that all the district councils are opposed to the union. The parish councils have opposed the union. The Association of Parish Councils were unanimous in their opposition to the union of Herefordshire and Worcestershire. There is a large amount of evidence that on this Amendment the councils of the County of Herefordshire are speaking for the people of Herefordshire. On other Amendments I might argue that possibly the councils do not reflect the views of the people they represent—that they do not reflect public opinion in that county. But that cannot be true of this situation in Herefordshire. I have absolutely no doubt on that score. The councils of Herefordshire are speaking for the people they represent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The executive committee of the National Farmers' Union—remember that
	<span class='label label-info column'>970</span>
this is an agricultural county—voted against the union. According to Press reports I have been shown they voted solidly against. The National Farmers' Union have written a letter which is in the documents being distributed to Committee members. The letter was addressed to the Clerk of Herefordshire County Council and it said that the National Farmers' Union is
	<br><blockquote><p>"utterly opposed" to the union of Hereford and Worcester.</p></blockquote>
The Country Landowners' Association has also expressed its opposition. Again, there is a letter which has been distributed to members of the Committee. The letter says that the Country Landowners' Association
	<br><blockquote><p>"wishes to express its wholehearted support for Herefordshire County Council in its opposition to amalgamation with Worcestershire."</p></blockquote>
The local government officers have expressed their point of view. The Herefordshire county branch of the National and Local Government Officers' Association have also written a letter which is available to the Committee. They make it quite clear that, based on their experience of local government in the County of Herefordshire, they are opposed to amalgamation with Worcestershire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then we have the doctors. The British Medical Association, Hereford Division, have expressed their opposition. The secretary, in a letter to the Department of the Environment, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I was instructed to bring to your attention their"—</p></blockquote>
the doctors'—
	<br><blockquote><p>"view that this would have an adverse effect on the medical and social services with which they are particularly concerned."</p></blockquote>
The lawyers have expressed their opposition to this amalgamation. That letter, too, is available to Committee members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The architects of the County of Herefordshire have also expressed their opposition to the union of these two counties. They are, no doubt, bearing in mind the transformation of the County of Worcestershire architecturally in the last few years—what has been described by architects as the rape of the City of Worcester. They are afraid that a similar fate would befall Herefordshire—that would be a tragedy for the country as a whole—if this union went through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A noble Lord in the other place has
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0527">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not read it.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not going to read them, Sir Stephen, because it would take too long. This was the reason for circulating them to members of the Committee. But, as the hon. Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack) pointed out, the members of the Committee will not have had time to read all this correspondence. I am simply drawing their attention to the groups who have opposed the union of Herefordshire and Worcestershire. The groups I have mentioned are the farmers, the country landowners, the local government officers, the doctors, the lawyers, the architects and a noble Lord. So strongly do many people feel in the County of Herefordshire, that we now have the situation where parishes in the western part of the county are taking polls. They are voting not about whether Herefordshire should join Worcestershire, but about whether their parishes should join Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be a strange result of this Bill if it were to dig again Offa's Dyke, because it is the parishes to the west of Offa's Dyke which are voting to join Wales. This is not parish councillors—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in a difficult position, Sir Stephen. I am doing my best to be as brief as possible, but Members of the Committee have pointed out that they have not had time to study these papers. That is no fault of the Committee. Neither is it the fault of Herefordshire County Council. It is desirable that members of
	<span class='label label-info column'>972</span>
the Committee should be aware of the strength of feeling in Herefordshire. That is what I am trying to illustrate. This is the only occasion on which the views of the people of Herefordshire has been expressed in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was drawing the Committee's attention to the fact that several parishes in Herefordshire are voting to join Wales. The other day the hon. Member for Meriden (Mr. Speed) gave us some figures about the views of parishes in the Chelmsley Wood area, near Birmingham. I said at the time that I was not very impressed with the polling figures. Very few people had voted. He gave figures of 10 per cent. to 15 per cent. taking part. He expressed great indignation that Chelmsley Wood was to be taken into the city of Birmingham. In Brilley, which is a small parish, 96 per cent. of the people went to the polling station to vote, of whom 135 voted to go into Wales and only 36 wanted to stay in Herefordshire if it was to be united with Worcestershire. We are discussing an agricultural county, and these are all small parishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the parish of Huntington, 56 people voted to join Wales rather than stay in Herefordshire if it was united with Worcestershire. In the parish of Knill the voting was 20 in favour of going into Wales and one who wished to remain in Herefordshire if it was linked with Worcestershire. In the parish of Lower Harpton, with even fewer electors—just under 40—there was an 80 per cent. poll, and the view was unanimous. There was only one abstention, and nobody wanted to stay in Herefordshire if it was linked with Worcestershire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Three villages with even smaller populations—the villages of Rodd, Nash and Little Brampton—had a parish meeting. The chair was taken by the noble Lord to whom I referred earlier, The noble Lord opposes the union of Herefordshire and Worcestershire, but he would prefer that to the fate which would befall him as a martial Lord if his parish transferred to Wales. He was in the chair, and he asked the local electors not to vote for Wales. They rewarded him by voting 8 to 5 to go into Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So strong is that feeling that it is now spreading away from those small parishes. If hon. Members look at that map they will see the urban district of Kington and the rural district of Kington in the west
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0528">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>973</span>
of Herefordshire. Those two authorities are now considering whether to apply to the Boundary Commission for transfer to the new district of Powys in Wales rather than stay in Hereford and Worcester. This is not because they want to leave Herefordshire; it is because they object to the merger between Herefordshire and Worcestershire—no more, no less.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is tremendously strong feeling throughout Herefordshire. Only a week ago the chairman of the county council wrote to the Prime Minister appealing to him to drop the Bill. A copy of that letter is available to members of the Committee. The Association of Parish Councils has also written to the Prime Minister. Its letter is not available to the Committee, and I think that it bears repetition. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have listened carefully to all that has been said on this subject in London, in Worcester and in Hereford and by our two M.P.s. We still feel that the case for merging Herefordshire and the area to the East of us"</p></blockquote>
—Worcestershire—
	<br><blockquote><p>"is a weak one.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Indeed it is the only really artificial creation in the whole of the Government's local government proposals and this unhappy situation has arisen because Herefordshire is in England and not in Wales.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The border being sacrosanct, Herefordshire has had to be squeezed in somewhere after everyone else has been more or less comfortably settled."</p></blockquote>
That clearly reflects the general opinion in the county of Hereford.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hereford City Council feels so strongly on the matter that it is planning a march to No. 10 Downing Street through the streets of the City of London—no doubt emulating Dick Whittington. Its members are going to march in full civic regalia—quite a sacrifice for some who object to wearing robes, but they are prepared to make that sacrifice if it will keep Herefordshire independent.

At a meeting on Saturday the county council agreed to send a solemn petition to Her Majesty the Queen. It was issued on Saturday, under the seal of the County Council of Hereford, asking the Queen to intervene in this legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have presented the case as it was given to me by the County of Hereford. The Government's argument can only be that Herefordshire is too small. That argument has been put forward to the people of Herefordshire. It has about 140,000 people, which is well below the
	<span class='label label-info column'>974</span>
Government's target of 250,000 people for a county council. We all recognise that. But the people of Herefordshire point to passages in the Government's White Paper which they have read with interest. They have asked me to draw these passages to the attention of the Minister in the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On page 6 of the White Paper presented to Parliament in February, 1971, the Government say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"But no one structure can be suitable equally for the densely and the sparsely populated areas."</p></blockquote>
We recognise that they are talking about the structure of one-tier or two-tier authorities. But the argument of the people of Hereford is that that applies to the preservation of their county as much as to the question whether it is a unitary authority or a two-tier authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Elsewhere in the White Paper the Government say that they
	<br><blockquote><p>"accept the view that the units appropriate to the provision of these services should have populations broadly within the range of 250,000 to 1,000,000. These limits should not be inflexible but it should only be in special circumstances that these services are provided by units with populations below this range."</p></blockquote>
The people of Herefordshire claim that there are special circumstances in the county. Elsewhere in the White Paper the Government say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The boundaries must be accepted as sensible by people on the spot."</p></blockquote>
The people of the county do not accept that it is sensible to unite Herefordshire and Worcestershire. It is not sensible. All the evidence that I have put forward to the Committee shows that. They are completely separate; they are divided by the Malvern Hills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On several occasions we have discussed whether a river unites or divides people on either bank, but nobody would ever put forward the case that a hill unites the people on either side of it. But that is what the Government are doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On page 4 of the brief distributed to members of the Committee they will find Herefordshire's answer to the question of rateable value. As they point out, Herefordshire has a higher rateable value per head than does Northumberland or North Yorkshire. I accept that in deciding whether a county can provide the services which will be so important in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0529">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>975</span>
future not only the rateable value per head but the total rateable value is important. But there is nothing to prevent Herefordshire and Worcestershire co-operating in the provision of any service, as they do now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maddan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been listening to the hon. Member's speech with great interest. I was fairly convinced in the early part of it, but less so in the latter part. When he now tells us that Herefordshire will not be a viable unit on its own his case is becoming extremely thin.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not saying that Herefordshire is not viable on its own; I am trying to answer in advance the reply which I expect the Minister to give, so that he can deal with it properly and we do not have a to-and-fro debate. The Government's case must be that Herefordshire 13 too small to be viable. That is what they have said in Press statements, but not to the representatives of the county council of Herefordshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is too small, by what criterion is it too small? Is it the population? It is a sparsely populated area. Is it the rateable value? If the rateable value is high in relation to the population, compared with other areas which the Government accept as county councils, their argument must be that the total of the rateable value is too low to support modern services in the future. If that is the case there is nothing to prevent the county of Hereford co-operating with the county of Worcester, as they have done in the past very successfully in all sorts of services. For example they co-operate already with the public analyst, and with the police force. They have a number of areas of co-operation all based on willingness, and not one insisted on by the Government or people in Whitehall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been no criticism by the Government of the services in Herefordshire. If they believe that the County of Hereford is not providing adequate social services, adequate educational services or anything else, they should say so. If the Government's only criterion is the number of people living in Herefordshire—it is about 140,000, a little more than half the target minimum established by the Government—then what are they to say when the people of Herefordshire point to
	<span class='label label-info column'>976</span>
the fact that the County of Powys, which the Government are to create in the Bill, will have a population of only 100,000? The County of Powys will cover Brecon, Radnorshire and Montgomeryshire, the counties neighbouring Herefordshire. They are very similar counties and sparsely populated. The Government have said—rightly, in my opinion—that Powys should stay as it is, that even with the three counties it still does not meet the Government's target minimum, and because it is sparsely populated nothing can be done about it. The argument for Herefordshire is that it is already more populous than the proposed county of Powys.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a letter issued by the Welsh Office in November 1971, the Montgomeryshire County Council, which will be included in the County of Powys, drew the Government's attention to the low population figure for the proposed County. It asked the Secretary of State to reconsider whether the County of Powys should be expanded to cover more of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government replied as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It has to. be accepted that this sparsely populated area must be served by a unit analogous to the least populous region in Scotland (apart from the all-purpose Orkney and Shetland authorities)—the proposed Borders region which will have a population of 96,000."</p></blockquote>
The case for the people of Herefordshire is that they, too, are a border region. They are on the borders of Wales and England and they believe that their county should be retained, that their population of 140,000 is capable of providing and maintaining the service which they need if the borders region in Scotland is capable of providing those services, and if the County of Powys also is capable of providing those services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people living in Worcestershire accept the proposed union with Herefordshire, though they do not advocate it. They are not marrying Herefordshire with enthusiasm but accept what the Government are proposing. So on the one hand there is Worcestershire not anxious to take over Herefordshire, with good reason, because the problems of Worcestershire will continue to be in the north of the county where there is an expanding population in new towns—and, on the other hand, the people of Herefordshire are unanimously opposed to the take-over.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To summarise the situation, it is that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0530">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>977</span>
the County of Herefordshire is different from Worcestershire. I believe that difference will be accentuated in future because the county of Herefordshire is looking towards the recreation of tourism as the basis of the economy, whereas the County of Worcestershire is looking more and more towards industry. Herefordshire has a fear of being dominated by Worcestershire. Communications do not connect the two counties and, as far as the wishes of the people are concerned, the unanimous view of the people of Herefordshire is that they wish to retain their present county. The case for the merger with Worcestershire has never been made out to their satisfaction. Ministers have not been to Herefordshire; they have not received a deputation from Herefordshire in order to explain why Herefordshire should merge with Worcestershire. The Government's attitude seems to be that the Government know best and that is not good enough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may revert very briefly to the Amendment of my hon. Friend the Minister of State I should like to deal with the question of names first raised by the hon. Member for Bromsgrove (Mr. Terry Davis). What he said is, in fact, the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was Halesowen that suggested it, as far as I know. I do not pretend to have a totally authoritative answer for him, but, to the best of my knowledge, the responsibility lies with Halesowen. It has emerged time and again from the hon. Gentleman's speech that the Government accepted it as a central feature of the area under consideration, and one which might have proved acceptable to the local people. It would also have had the virtue—not a substantial one, but nevertheless one that is worth pursuing—that it would have avoided the linking of two former county names into a long and relatively unwieldy name.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it has become quite apparent that the name of Malvernshire is not acceptable to the local people, and the Government Amendment seeks to replace the original idea of Malvernshire by the new joint name of Hereford and Worcester. I hope that hon. Gentlemen will feel that this is in accurate reflection of local opinion, and one which they will feel able to accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to starred Amendments Nos. 513 and 514. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is grateful to you, Sir Stephen,
	<span class='label label-info column'>978</span>
for calling them, although it puts Ministers in the slightly difficult situation of having a very short time in which to examine, not so much the Amendments themselves, which are relatively simple and represent a totally familiar case to us, but the detailed briefing which has been supplied in the last few hours to members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I think the hon. Member for Bromsgrove would accept, and the committee which followed the deliberations on local government reorganisation would accept, that the case which the hon. Gentleman has pleaded is, broadly speaking, a very familiar case and one that has been put forward continuously by those who feel very strongly that they would like to preserve an independent Herefordshire. The Amendments have the effect of going back to the present position of having an independent Worcestershire minus the county borough of Warley and the boroughs of Halesowen and Stourbridge, which are moving into the metropolitan area to the north. The remainder of the County of Worcester will be an independent county, and the existing county of Hereford will be retained as an independent county.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bromsgrove was realistic somewhat late in his speech, when he came to the crucial point around which the whole debate revolves, namely whether or not one has to have a minimum level of population in order to create the viable local authority units that the Government have always sought to achieve. If one were to seek authorities in the 100,000, 120,000 or 140,000 range, the local government reorganisation Bill would not look like the present Bill. It would not consist of the number of authorities that are proposed. There would be endless permutations throughout the country which would have been pleaded with arguments very much the same as those put forward by the hon. Member for Bromsgrove, expressing local loyalties and local ambitions of various authorities to expand into their neighbouring territories. A whole range of permutations are possible if one accepts that local government reorganisation should be based on a criterion somewhat closer to the figure of about one-half of the figure in the Government White Paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister explain the point raised by my hon.

	<span class='label label-info column'>979</span>
Friend about why the Government adopt a different criterion in an adjacent area? If there are differing considerations for Wales, that underlines our argument that Wales should not be tacked on to the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly will in the briefest terms deal with the point raised by the right hon. Member about the county of Powys, but I am sure that he would not wish to anticipate the debate on Wales. It certainly has a relevance, and in that it has relevance I shall try to make one or two of the points. But I would want the matter to be dealt with when Wales is considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we have argued for, and I think it is generally accepted, a figure of about 250,000 for the new county authorities, in order that the educational and social services should be organised with sufficient financial resources behind them to give the service which is today considered a minimum, we have said in the White Paper that we want to achieve flexibility. We have not said 250,000—and one below and that is it. It is true, however, that the smallest county—Northumberland—is 272,000, nearly twice the level of the independent Herefordshire which we are now considering. The smallest metropolitan district—South Shields—is 177,000. So there is flexibility, and in those cases we felt that there were overriding arguments, difficult though they were, particularly with metropolitan districts, to accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bromsgrove raised again the subject of Powys. This, again, is an example of the sort of exceptional circumstances which arise from the very sparsely spread population that is to be found in that particular area. It is interesting to note that the population of Powys is so sparse that it has a population less than that of Herefordshire, as would be created by the Amendment, and yet the area is larger than Herefordshire and Worcestershire combined. That is an example of the real contrast which exists between Herefordshire and Powys. That is all I want to say in anticipation of what I have no doubt will be a detailed and thrusting examination of the Welsh proposals when we reach them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>980</span>
It is accepted that the purpose behind the White Paper, if one is to reorganise within relatively large administrative units based on the broad description of a population of 250,000, is to bring about amalgamations of areas, and in several cases counties, which is bound to tug at the great emotional links that people feel with their historical ties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I personally sympathise immensely with those reasons. Indeed, one of the arguments for basing reorganisation on the concept of countries is very much that these historical ties do exist, and one did not want to break them in the reorganisation of local government. It is a significant argument in favour of what we are doing as opposed to the totally irradical approach of a unitary authority. Nevertheless where one finds it necessary to break the loyalties of traditional counties one is bound to be faced with the sort of arguments which have been presented by the hon. Member for Bromsgrove.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like now to deal with the question of communications. The document which was sent to the Government by the county of Herefordshire in May 1971 quotes from the Redcliffe-Maud Commission, page 248, where it states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"… although the Malvern Hills form a kind of easterly 'wall' to the Herefordshire plain, they are by-passed as well as crossed, by several A roads linking the two counties, by the Ross Spur motorway and by the railway from Worcester to Hereford."</p></blockquote>
So the question of communications was looked at by Redcliffe-Maud and was considered not to be insurmountable in the context of what it eventually came to recommend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are alternatives. I do not want to take up the time of the Committee on the question of what could happen to Herefordshire if one were looking for alternative linking. One could look to the north, to the south and, in very unusual circumstances, to the west. But the Amendments do not anticipate any of those possibilities. One therefore looks to the only practical possibility, which is an amalgamation with Worcestershire, to the east, across the Malvern Hills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bromsgrove made play of the differences that could be said to exist between Worcestershire and Herefordshire. However, the fact of the matter is that there are more similarities, and that there will be even greater similarities between the remain-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0532">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>981</span>
ing part of the former county of Worcestershire and the existing county of Herefordshire than his speech might have led us to believe. They are, and they will increasingly be, with the areas from. Worcestershire removed to the north, agricultural communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that the traditional loyalties associated with the name of Herefordshire, whether in cultural activities, or sporting or agricultural activities, will disappear. Certainly there has been no evidence of that in the case of former local government reorganisation, particularly in London, where the legal existence of the name has gofie out of use in local government terms but where its traditional use with respect to various community activities has continued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, I ask the hon. Member not to press the Amendment, which the Government would be compelled to resist. It is fail for, him to, say that we cannot be expected to have read every last document put before us, since they have been put before us only very recently. It is equally fair for me to point out that the arguments made tonight are not new. They have been considered by local authority boundary commissions, by Ministers and Departments. They are familiar to us. Thus I have to tell the hon. Gentleman that we consider the future of Hereford will be more than adequately safeguarded under the present terms of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary has given a disappointing reply to my hon. Friend.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is quite right. This was an area different from those which the various Ministers visited: areas where complicated and difficult issues existed which we felt needed an on-the-spot examination. In this case, we did not believe that there were issues where examination on the ground would change our mind about the, basic problems involved. That in no way reflects upon the depth of the feeling. We simply felt that we understood the issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the hon. Member for Bromsgrove did less than justice to the fact that
	<span class='label label-info column'>982</span>
the Secretary of State saw informally a deputation from the local authority, and discussed the question with them. It is understandable that he should have in interest in this matter, representing as he does a neighbouring authority. Thus consultation certainly took place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister accept that the people of Herefordshire were not satisfied with that consultation Of 15 or 20 minutes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be fair to say in respect of local government morganisation, that no one who has been unable to succeed in their case is satisfied that they have done everything possible to that end. That is a problem with which we have been faced all over the country. We had to attempt to draw guidelines as to where we would or would not go. I believe that we did everything humanly reasonable in visiting places where we felt that an additional dimension of experience might assist us in forming a judgment. However, Hereford was not one of those cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has done himself less than justice tonight. The arguments to which the Committee has listened hour after hour concerning local democracy, about the wishes of the people being paramount, and the Minister's concern not to ride roughshod over places with great historical traditions behind them, all appear to have been forgotten in the case of Herefordshire—a county adjacent to the Principality of Wales and represented by the Minister of State for Wales. I shall return to that point later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The County of Hereford is, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove (Mr. Terry Davis) has said, one of the richest counties in British history in the whole of the United Kingdom. It has survived all the past wars and the Black Death, but apparently it cannot survive the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must bear in mind that Wales is included in the Bill—and it has a direct bearing on Herefordshire, our next-door neighbour—because the same principles and considerations are said to apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have read the correspondence from Hereford. If the hon. Member for Hereford (Mr. Gibson-Watt) can speak for Wales, I can speak for Hereford. I was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1971-1972V004P0I0533">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>983</span>
distressed to see the resolution passed by the city council at Hereford and sent to us by the town clerk, expressing displeasure towards the Secretary of State for the Environment and the Member of Parliament for Hereford. My hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove was speaking without exaggeration when he described the resentment of the people of Hereford—a proud and independent people, as well I know—at the treatment they have received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By chance the Secretary of State for the Environment sits for Worcester and the Minister of State for Wales for Hereford. A copy of the letter to the Prime Minister was sent to the Secretary of State for Wales—who is Chairman of the Conservative and Unionist Central Office. These Ministers are clearly involved in the question now before the Committee. The chairman of the county council, Ald. David Porter, J.P.—whose politics I do not know although I can make a fair guess—uses strong words to the Prime Minister, saying that he writes asking him
	<span class='label label-info column'>984</span>
to have the Bill withdrawn immediately, since it is causing tremendous and justified ill-feeling among the people of Herefordshire. On this occasion Herefordshire also speaks for Wales. The Bill is unnecessary, unpopular, and ill-conceived, and the source of much frustration. The letter I referred to concludes with lines from the preface to the Book of Common Prayer, but I doubt if even that will help the Government.
