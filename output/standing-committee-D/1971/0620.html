</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p>The hon. Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Meacher) is moving only one Amendment, but he is perfectly in order in discussing the others. I am not inviting him to repeat his first speech on each Amendment, but many of his arguments apply to the other Amendments, and he will be in order in referring to them.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the interests of the progress of business, Sir Stephen, I shall not repeat what is necessarily a long speech on each Amendment, which would mean that we should be here for ever.<br><br>
It might be useful for me to begin by recapitulating briefly the arguments which I put forward at our last Sitting, partly because I want to comment a little further on the points made by the Government in interventions. I refer the Committee to what was said by the Secretary of State on Second Reading:
<br><blockquote><p>"The question that the Government must answer is: why is the benefit increase not more than 75p for a single person and £1.20 for a married couple, and 85p and £1.30 respectively in the case of the supplementary benefit? Much emphasis has been put on the fact that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer reduced taxation across the board on all taxpayers by £1 a week in the Budget this year."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 18th May, 1972; Vol. 837, <i>c.</i> 718.]</p></blockquote>
I made the point strongly—it is a point to be made to the Government, though it is not our main argument in putting forward the Amendment—that the pre-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 134</span>
vious £1 increase, with the coming for the single pensioner in October, are purely counter-inflationary and therefore not an alternative to the £1 to all tax-paying households. The Under-Secretary of State said, through his hon. Friends, that had the £1 increase been given to pensioners it would have meant a substantial reduction of the £1 benefit to the rest of the taxpaying community. That is true as far as it goes.<br><br>
The point we are making is that, to be fair all round, there should be some flexibility, so that the rest of the community do not receive the whole £1 but pensioners receive the same net amount as the taxpayers, whether that amount be 80p or whatever. It is perfectly possible to adjust that £1 reduction in income tax net to an increasing national insurance contribution to make sure that the benefit received by the taxpaying members of the community is the same in net terms as that received by old-age pensioners. There is nothing to stop the Government doing that, and it would have satisfied us, but they did not do it.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary of State gave figures of the cost in terms of increased national insurance contributions. The Government have, with a great deal of justice, pointed out that the 75p increase has been made possible by an increase in national insurance contributions for the low paid of a mere matter of a few pence. In terms of the backs that find it hardest to bear, a further £1 increase would not be so expensive; it would be a matter at the most of 10p, which is not a substantial extra burden on the lower paid, and the increase could chiefly be borne by those higher up the earnings scale. There is no reason why this could not have been done. It is purely a question of priorities, and the Government's priorities in this matter are not ours.<br><br>
At the last Sitting, I went on more generally to say that £6.75 for the single person pension was not enough, and I put forward arguments about inflation which are well recognised on both sides of the Committee. Wherever one begins the calculation of the loss through inflation which is made up by a pension increase, at whatever point the process ends pensioners might be slightly better off or slightly worse off; the margin is very small on either side. We say that it is quite inadequate that over three or four years from a particular date pensioners
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0635">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 135</span>
are no better off in real terms than a mere matter of 30p or, on some calculations, they are perhaps 30p to 50p worse off. Whichever way it is, it is inadequate.<br><br>
I ended last time by saying that we are told that pensions need not be increased because pensioners have concessions—concessionary bus fares, concessionary chiropody services, meals on wheels for a few, 150,000 concessionary television licence fees, and a few special concessions for telephone services. The trouble here is that we are always chasing our own tail. When we suggest an increase in these concessions to make £6 a week or £9.70 more tolerable as a standard of living for the main mass of people on welfare benefits, we are told that it would be inefficient to interfere too much with the price mechanism and that the proper way to do it is by increasing the pension.<br><br>
When we come here and ask for an increase in the pension, we are told that there are these other concessions. On numerous occasions, the Under-Secretary of State has told us about the long list of small concessions which are available and which allegedly top up the pension and make it tolerable. The concessions are extremely small and apply only to a few people.<br><br>
We, therefore, argue that this is the point—as the President of the United States once said—where the "buck" must stop. We are asking that a decision be made finally in this Committee on what is the proper standard of living. Either the concessions must be on a wide scale and substantial, or we need a major and significant increase in the pension. Not only this Government but the previous Government have refused to do that. They have refused to make increases in various concessions, which probably would be a saving in the long term, for example, on television licence fees and telephone services.<br><br>
Telephone services may be regarded as more necessary than television, which still has overtones of luxury, although those overtones do not apply in old age. Not only are television sets and telephones expensive but value added tax is to be imposed on them which will increase the cost by 10 per cent.<br><br>
According to a survey recently undertaken in Hull and reported in a booklet entitled, "Lifeline Telephone Service for the Elderly", it has been shown that a significant minority of elderly people
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 136</span>
without telephones, who were entirely matched in terms of mortality expectation with others who had, went into homes during the project year and consequently incurred a substantial increase in cost to the community because of the heavy capital and current costs of running a welfare home. On that basis, which I accept will have to be confirmed by further data, it would be cheaper to provide free telephone services for all elderly persons and thus reduce the cost of welfare accommodation, which is likely to be considerable on the basis of the survey.<br><br>
Even where concessions are likely to be advantageous in economic as well as social terms, we were told in Committee on the Finance Bill that we should come back to the Department of Health and Social Security and ask for an increase in the pension. That is precisely what we are doing. We are asking for an increase in the pension on the ground that the other concessions will not be granted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank Marsden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be of interest to the Committee to know that in Liverpool the Post Office Engineers Union has said repeatedly that its members will install telephones for old-age pensioners and the aged in their spare time, free of charge.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising that point. It emphasises that, even where concessions are offered on particularly attractive terms, for technical and administrative reasons they are turned down. So we come back to the point that either we have concessions or we have an increase in the pension. Otherwise, the Government must say that £6.75 is enough for the single person, whether as an old-age pension or as welfare benefit. The fundamental question is: Which is it? we want an answer. The pension increase is merely counter-inflationary; it is in no sense an alternative to the absence of a substantial spread of other concessions.<br><br>
My last argument on why the £6.75 for a single person is not enough is this. It is said that there are always supplementary benefits for which people can apply which look after the payment of rent and which make them considerably better off unless they are given a pension increase even larger than the one we propose. But a substantial proportion of elderly people who are eligible for supplementary bene-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0636">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 137</span>
fit do not claim it. The proportion is probably between ¾ million and 1 million.<br><br>
The latest official survey on this was reported in a booklet entitled, "Financial and other Circumstances of Retirement Pensioners", which the Labour Administration published in 1966 or 1967. It showed that at that time—there is no reason to suppose that the situation has significantly changed—¾ million elderly person households below supplementary benefit level had not claimed it, not because the people were unaware of their entitlement but because their memories of the pre-1948 poor law were too much for them and they were not prepared to submit to a means test.<br><br>
Those people will not be assisted by the argument that, although the Government do not intend to increase the pension, they can claim higher supplementary benefit. They will not claim it. On the other hand, if the Amendment were accepted, those people would receive the benefit as of right in a way which was acceptable to them and they would have an increase of £2 a week instead of only 75p. That is a powerful argument for the Amendment. Those are arguments why we believe that the £6.75 is not enough for a single person, and they apply <i>pari passu</i> to married persons.<br><br>
The third main heading under which I press the Amendment concerns social justice. This argument was raised when we looked at the first Amendment, and I shall not again go over the figures. I remind the Committee that in comparable terms in relation to Exchequer grants to other members of the community, the Exchequer contribution under the first pension increase scheme of September last year was about £100 million; this year it is roughly £85 million, together with £15 million given this year alone by exempting the pension increase from tax, making a total of £200 million, which, divided by the 7½ million pensioners, makes an increase of roughly £25 per person.<br><br>
I was unable, because of a Select Committee visit, to be present at the second Sitting of the Committee. When I used this argument at the first Sitting, it was criticised on the ground that I should not exclude the increase in the national insurance contributions. I deliberately said that there was a significant difference between the two.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 138</span>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
It is right to look at what the Exchequer has given out of general taxation to different groups of the community and compare it with how much has been given per head to the elderly. On that basis, the figure for these two years would be about £25. Even if I were to concede, which I do not, that one should take into account the effect of increased national insurance contributions the total would be raised to about £90 per elderly person.<br><br>
If one takes purely the second Budget, let alone the benefits from the first one, on the two items which happen to have been costed by the Treasury for me, the distribution of benefit from raising the level of the investment surcharge and personal allowances for the taxpaying community, let alone unquantifiable items such as share options, the reduction of corporation tax and the rest, to those earning over £5,000 a year—1.2 per cent. of our work force—comes to £145 million; which works out at roughly £360 per person.<br><br>
In terms of need, that cannot be remotely justified in relation to the figure of £25 per elderly person, or, as might be required by some hon. Members opposite, £90. But even with their figure, it is a quarter for the elderly of what is going to the richest section. We regard that as intolerable. We cannot accept a distribution of benefits which are skewed and biased in a totally unjustified way, in social terms, in favour of the well off sections of the community.<br><br>
Now, let us consider those earning over £2,000, roughly the better off third of the community. Their benefit from those two concessions in this Budget alone total, on the personal allowance side, about £490 million, and on the investment surcharge side about £265 million, making a total of £755 million. This is rather over £250 per person.<br><br>
Leaving aside the very rich section, who are supposed to work such great wonders for this country because of the extra wealth and resources which, allegedly, they create and the investment which they are supposed to pump into the community from which all are supposed to gain—though there is no evidence of that as yet—the better off third have gained rather more than ten times what the elderly have gained, on my figure, or, on the figure asked for at the second Sitting by the hon. Member for Wells (Mr.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0637">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 139</span>
Boscawen), they have gained three times as much per person as with the elderly.<br><br>
In these terms I do not see how it is possible, even with the <i>sang froid</i> of this Government, to justify the meanness of their figures. I lay great stress on the argument of social justice. There is no answer to it. I shall listen with great care to the Under-Secretary. It is a shameful exercise in redistribution to the rich, from which pensioners and other welfare beneficiaries have lost.<br><br>
The second argument on the principle of social justice is simple: in general, since 1948 there has been an increase in real resources to the earning section of the community of about 2 per cent. per year. It has gone down in certain years to 1 per cent. or even less, and it has risen as high as 3 per cent. or 4 per cent., but by and large it has averaged 2 per cent. Moreover, it is cumulative, with each increase compounded with the increase in previous years.<br><br>
Leaving aside the deviations from year to year—sometimes more, sometimes less, depending on the economic situation—pensions have done nothing more than keep level with the index of prices. The relationship with earnings has not been fully maintained because the rising standard of living of the rest of the community has not been fully reflected. There were prosperity rises in 1959 and 1963, but these quickly evaporated with the resurrection of market forces, and since the early 1960's pensions have gone back again into line.<br><br>
It is time now, at last, when we have had such a magnificent trading surplus and the opportunity to give away £3,000 million, to give the pensioners at least an extra stake in the rising standard of living of the community. We have this unparalleled opportunity, which the Government so far show no sign of taking.<br><br>
If those arguments are accepted, one comes to the basic question: What ought the level of pension to be? We are in no sense arguing that £8 is adequate. But a one-third increase on what it might otherwise be is a substantial plus, thought it is not adequate.<br><br>
The facts about pensions are difficult to put across in a new, fresh and striking way. The trouble is that the growing hardship of living week by week on £6, or £6.75 as it will be, and £9.70 for a married couple, is so well known and familiar
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 140</span>
that the rest of the community tend to accept it on the ground that, having got used to it for 25 years, we must somehow regard it as impossible to change the situation.<br><br>
Pensioners have, by and large, given up hope that the situation will be changed. This fact can be illustrated by quotations from an Age Concern document. The couple quoted were rather older supplementary pensioners, and the husband was blind. The woman said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We always have money worries. You can't have luxuries or anything like that ֵ I don't buy meat because it's too expensive … When we got behind with the rates when my husband went into hospital I sold my rings and everything. Then I had another bill for the rates—and the bailiffs came round, put on to me by the rates people … And the electricity and gas bills worry me terribly … no, I couldn't tell you what I spend on food."</p></blockquote>
It is best put into context in relation to the benefits which are going to some of the higher paid pensioners, those with a decent occupational pension, which makes a great deal of difference. Another couple interviewed said:
<br><blockquote><p>"People on a State Pension must find it dreadfully difficult … What is it—£5 for a single person? Well, my weekly housekeeping comes to more than that and we grow all our own vegetables which saves us a lot."</p></blockquote>
To live on £6.75 is to live continually worrying about the next bill. It is to live by eating inadequately, by sitting in the kitchen to keep warm, by staying in the house to save on bus fares, by going to bed early to keep warm, or by cutting back on essential food.<br><br>
All members of this Committee are aware of these facts. The trouble is that we are too well aware and too familiar with them to believe that it can be otherwise.<br><br>
The gross inadequacy of the pension can be shown by the fact that at the present time the supplementary benefit for a single person is £5.80, plus rent for the average one pensioner household, which comes to about £8. In other words, what we suggest in the Amendment is that the pension should be raised to the level of the present supplementary pension plus rent for a single person household. At present, it is £2 or more below the level of what is regarded as subsistence—and no one can say that the subsistence line is in any sense generous. It is as mean and parsimonious as a civilised society could possibly get away with, yet the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0638">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 141</span>
pension is £2 a week below it. That is what we are seeking to remedy.<br><br>
The Secretary of State has repeatedly referred to the income distribution among pensioners. In fact, one-third are living at or below the State poverty line. That is 2½ million pensioners. One-third are living at no more than £2 above that line, and one-third are living above it. This means that two-thirds are living at less than £2 above the supplementary benefit line—a staggering indictment of the meanness of our society.<br><br>
It is not true that it is impossible for a better deal to be given to the old folk. The gross national product has doubled since 1948, yet the relationship between pensions and earnings and prices has hardly shifted, and certainly not favourably for the pensioner. If we do not accept a major increase in a year like this when there is an unparalleled opportunity, that relationship, fixed in 1948, will stay for all time, whether the country is twice, three times or four times better off. Presumably, the GNP will double again in the next 20 years. Will the pension still be the same one-fifth of average national earnings?<br><br>
To the extent that increases go on a percentage basis, we shall perpetuate the relative deprivation forever. Is that the Government's intention at this time of unparalleled opportunity? Is the greater wealth of the country which has been created over the years not to be reflected in an improvement in the relationship between pensions and national average earnings and the retail price index? It is unreasonable at this very low standard to rely on percentage increases, which mean that even if in absolute terms they are slightly better off, in relative terms they will never be better off. It is totally unacceptable, especially when we have such an opportunity, and it is not true that we could not improve the pension in relation to rising standards of living.<br><br>

The main argument here stems from what other countries have done. This country is as well off, with one exception, as any other country in Europe, yet the level of pension in those countries shows how poorly we are doing. There is no reason to suppose that, even if we enter the EEC, the pension will float upwards.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 142</span>
It has not happened since 1958 in the Common Market countries. There has been no change in their social provisions. They already had better provision than we have, and they have if anything increased the difference—but as a result purely of domestic policies and not of harmonisation.<br><br>
In France, if one retires at 60, the pension is 20 per cent. of average earnings for the last 10 years. If one retires at 65, it is 40 per cent., and at the age of 70 it is 60 per cent. These are large increments for the pensioner who stays at work—much larger than for those who stay at work in this country. It is a minimum of £2.50, which is exceedingly low, and a maximum of £10. But the majority will do better in France than in this country.<br><br>
In Germany, the situation is substantially superior to ours. The pension is 60 per cent. of insurable earnings over 40 years of insurance and is reduced for every year for which there is no insurance. But in most cases, of course, there is insurance. That level approximates to the level aimed at by the National Superannuation Bill, which was lost in 1970, and is well above any apparent intention of the British Government at this time.<br><br>
In Italy, the pension is 1.85 per cent. of average earnings for the highest three years of the last five years multiplied by the number of years of contribution up to 40. That is a complicated formula, but it works out in practice at a minimum pension of £4 and a maximum of 74 per cent. of average earnings three years before retirement. There is an automatic revaluation of pensions each year for every 2 per cent. change in the cost of living index. That is a substantially better protection for the pensioner population in Italy than we have.<br><br>
In Belgium, the situation is similar to that in Germany—60 per cent. of average gross earnings for which there has been insurance provided over a period of 45 years—that is, the whole of working life. In the Netherlands, the pension is nearly £10 less one-fiftieth for every year short of insurance below 50. That is a similar kind of formula although with a rather higher average level of pension at nearly £10. In Luxembourg, the basic pension is £4 plus 1.6 per cent. of total insured earnings, giving a minimum of £6.50 a week and a maximum of five-sixths of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0639">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 143</span>
insured earnings—very much higher than we provide.<br><br>
These figures are taken from the helpful documentation which Governments by convention place in the Library, and they are the latest available, although they are one year old. If anything, the figures will now be better. If one considers what these countries will be doing next October or at the end of this year or beginning of next, I imagine that they will in every case be better. So we are talking about a minimum, but even that minimum is in every case on average better than what we offer our pensioners.<br><br>
In terms of our wealth, which in every case except that of Germany is greater than the countries I have cited, there is no excuse for continuing the pension at such a mean and parsimonious level. There is no reason why the pension must stay at one-fifth only of national average earnings.<br><br>
These may seem lengthy comments, but in view of the importance of the Amendment—every hon. Member must have had experience on the doorstep of pensioners making the point that £6, or whatever it was then, is just not enough—I think that I am being very moderate in the way that I am putting the case. I want to turn briefly to other benefits. The Amendments cover the whole range, and I shall put what seem to me the main advantages for some of the other beneficiaries.<br><br>
First, unemployment benefit. At the moment, earnings-related supplement of up to £7 a week can be obtained for the first six months. Obviously, the number on long-term unemployment has substantially increased in the last year, so the significance here is so much the greater now. After that first six months, an unemployed man and his family sink back to the basic level. After two years, there is a rise with the long-term addition.<br><br>
This has nothing to do with need. It is an administrative anomaly, but it would be significantly reduced if the Amendment were accepted. I do not know what the average level of earnings-related supplement to the basic flat rate unemployment benefit is, but it is probably about £3 or £4. If there were a loss of that but a gain through the flat rate being raised by £2, the change after six months would be much reduced; there would be a smoother transition.<br><br>
Since these people are not in this situa-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 144</span>
tion voluntarily—they desperately need a job, and whatever the reasons, are penalised by inability to get one—it is unreasonable to deny them the opportunity after six months of a decent standard of living. To suggest that they can claim supplementary benefits is to say, "When you are denied a job because of the effects of economic policy, whatever the causes, you are forced to admit poverty, which is what a means-tested supplementation of one's income involves, in order to get that little extra". Is that a civilised way of going on with unemployment in Britain in 1972? It would make a great deal of difference to this whole question of a means test for the long-term unemployed if the Amendment were accepted and the flat rate unemployment benefit for a single person were raised to £8.<br><br>
Second, on sickness and invalidity benefit, there is a very similar pattern—the earnings-related part for the first six months and then a fall back to flat rate invalidity benefit of £6. The Government recognise the injustice of expecting people with long-term invalidity to put up with a flat rate benefit by providing the invalidity allowance. We have had a lengthy discussion as to whether 30p and 60p—or, as they will be raised, 35p and 70p—are adequate, depending on age, or whether they should be £1.15 which is what our first Amendment proposed.<br><br>
Our suggestion here, irrespective of age, is that the level should be raised from £6 to £8—in other words, instead of the maximum, as it would be before the up-rating, of £7.15 or, after the up-rating, of £7.90—we are suggesting that it would be automatically £8 for everyone. In other words, there would be little difference between people at the top rate, as it will be, once the Government's up-rating is accepted in conjunction with the top rate of invalidity allowance, and what we are suggesting for all invalidity beneficiaries, irrespective of age. So we come back to the argument as to whether it is right for people of higher ages to get it as well. We think that that is justified and that it should be £8 for everyone.<br><br>
The third group with whom I am concerned are widows. One might argue—I would accept this—that a widow who is relatively young and who does not have children has no special call on our generosity, because she can return to work. But if a widow is rather older—I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0640">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 145</span>
would not want to specify a particular age—and also, more particularly, if she has children, she has no alternative, with the present widow's benefit of £6—or £6.75 as it will be—but to seek work. In other words, we are forcing someone with dependants to go out to work to increase her income.<br><br>
One hears so often arguments about the desirability of women working. Although there are differences of view here—there is no clear-cut answer; it depends on what alternative child-minding arrangements are available, on the age of the child and also on the length of employment of the woman and what part of the day she is away and when she gets away—it would be wrong in the present situation, which will continue if only the Government's up-rating is accepted, for us to force widows with children into employment merely in order to get a minimum standard of living.<br><br>
I would not assert that even the acceptance of our Amendment would make that difference in all cases, but in a significant number it might. For that reason, I believe once again that this is a powerful argument in favour of accepting the Amendment.<br><br>
The last case that I want to raise concerns industrial injury beneficiaries. I have already had a debate on the Adjournment with the Under-Secretary about this issue, when I mentioned the level of benefit. In an industry with a real danger of contracting an occupational disease, a significant minority of employees do so, and for the last so many years of their working life, and after the age of retirement, they are smitten with a disease which in the end is likely to kill.<br><br>
These diseases are well-known in this place—pneumoconiosis, byssinosis, the list is a long one. There are 45 prescribed industrial diseases under Section 56 of the Industrial Injuries Act, 1965. We believe that the list could be longer. But the point is that these people, who have worked all their lives and have been thrifty hardworking citizens just as we hope and expect people to be, are then struck down with a disease for which the maximum 100 per cent. assessment is now £10 a week and will be raised to £11.20. That is the reward in an unknown but large number of cases for working in an occupation with these dangers, in which it is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 146</span>
known at the start that a certain number will contract these diseases.<br><br>
That is a disgrace. The Amendment would increase the rate to £13.35. I still do not think that that is adequate, but it is a good deal better than the Government are proposing merely by an up-rating to take account of inflation. It is intolerable that, when doing these jobs which no one else wants, because they are not particularly well paid, these people are not rewarded so as to compensate them for the likelihood of contracting a prescribed disease. Yet when they do contract one, all we can offer is £10.<br><br>
There is a scale, of course, which goes right down to 20 per cent. disablement and gives only £2 a week, which will be raised to £2.24. If we cannot raise these figures, I am ashamed of the society in which I live.<br><br>
I said in that Adjournment debate that there is a substantial surplus on the Industrial Injuries Fund. That is accepted on both sides. It is £363 million, and has risen at a rate of between £6 million and £11 million each year. The Under-Secretary, in his reply, said:
<br><blockquote><p>"This is in no way "—</p></blockquote>
referring to the £363 million—
<br><blockquote><p>"out of proportion to the income and outgoing of the scheme, which is about £120 million a year."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 14th June, 1972; Vol. 838, <i>c</i>. 1663.]</p></blockquote>
I am not suggesting that it is possible to make the kind of increases I am proposing without an increase in contributions, but to say, as the Under-Secretary said later, that there is no surplus fat in the scheme—that was his phrase—when the existing surplus is three times the level of the annual income and outgo seems curious; and when it is increasing at a regular rate it is unforgiveable that we do not at least to some degree increase the industrial injuries benefit over and above making up any loss of purchasing power through inflation, working back through the surplus and making sure it goes to the people who have paid for it lest they contract a prescribed disease.<br><br>
I put the point strongly in general with regard to the disabled, and particularly about those disabled as a result of service to the rest of the community in one of the unpleasant sectors of the economy with great risks attached where, with all the safety factors, the risks cannot be de-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0641">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 147</span>
creased beyond a certain point. The reward should be at a substantially higher level than at present.<br><br>
I have been brief in talking about these beneficiaries, and I could go on at greater length. I hope that my hon. Friends will do so. I want to turn now to the question, which I must, of course, answer—the cost of the Amendment.<br><br>
I face this squarely. There will be a substantial cost. The cost with regard to the retirement pension, which is the greater part of the cost because there are so many more retirement pensioners than those in other categories, is likely to be about £700 million, but to the extent that the pension is raised and, therefore, automatically the supplementary benefit is likely to be reduced, the cost will be about £600 million. There is also likely to be a certain tax claw-back which will cut the cost for the retirement pensions to about £550 million.<br><br>
However, we are talking not only about retirement pensioners but about all the other related benefits. If we take them all into account, including supplementary benefit, the cost is likely to be £1,200 million gross, although the net amount is likely to be down to £950 million. But if one does not increase supplementary benefit at the same time—it would, I think, be acceptable to us to increase the insurance benefit but not the supplementary benefit, which would maintain its relationship with national average earnings—what we are talking about here is a national insurance benefit increased as of right. The net cost, with tax claw-back and taking a large number of people off supplementary benefit, would be £800 million to £850 million.<br><br>
Although that may sound large, it is to be put into proportion in relation to the £1 income tax reduction through personal allowances to all taxpaying households, which will cost £1,200 million in a full year. We are asking for substantially less than that.<br><br>
It could have been paid for wholly out of the Exchequer this year without any increase in the insurance contribution. That is the meaning of those large give-aways.<br><br>
But I am not suggesting it would have been paid for wholly out of the Exchequer in this year of years, but, clearly, a much increased proportion could have been paid for out of the Exchequer, in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 148</span>
view of our priorities.<br><br>
It will have to be covered in future years, which will be hard and difficult years and not years with the opportunities we have had this time. What I am saying is that if taxes have to be raised and one has to deflate the economy, and if, then, one achieves boom conditions, it is possible to take a substantial amount of that increased taxation out of higher social security contributions—not the whole but a significant proportion of the increase. Of course, one would lose flexibility if one took it wholly out of increased social security contributions, but one could have paid a larger proportion out of the Exchequer contribution this year, and in future years this could be done when the cost would have to be met in a way in which it need not have been met this year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. R. A. McCrindle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am anxious to assist the hon. Member in his commendable brevity. It would be helpful if he would spell out for the benefit of the man on the Clapham omnibus that he is saying that the Government were wrong in giving away £1 and should not have done so. Is he saying that we should have kept taxation at the level at which it stood before the Budget, in order to finance the increases he has proposed?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can only believe that the hon. Member did not hear the beginning of the speech, when I recapitulated at some length the argument on the amounts given away in taxation through increased personal allowance to each tax-paying household. By all means let us do that—it need not be the same for everyone—provided that at the same time we make sure of an increase to pensioners.<br><br>
The only argument which the Under-Secretary could adduce was that there would have to be an increase in the national insurance contribution to give a £1 or equivalent increase to pensioners. We are asking: let it be 80p to the rest of the population and 80p to the pensioners. Why should the pensioner be left in the cold, with £1,200 million being given to the better off? That is the basic inequity of the Government's case. We do not say that there should be nothing given away but that there should be fair shares for all.<br><br>
There are two general points to be made. The Exchequer contribution could be increased. It has been falling ever since
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0642">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 149</span>
1948. In 1949–50 the Exchequer contribution amounted to 23.9 per cent. whereas, according to the Government Actuary's Report, on the latest available figures, the 1973–74 the Exchequer supplement on the same basis will be 14.3 per cent. That is a drop of well over a third. I appreciate that 18 per cent. is a figure often put around, but I am putting it on the same basis—23.9 in 1949 and 14.3 per cent. in 1973–74.<br><br>
That is too small, when the principle of Exchequer supplement is that it is a contribution from the rest of the community to the pensioners as opposed to substantial contributions by the skilled working class to the elderly. What has happened now—we support it—is that the lower paid pay disproportionately less of each increase in contribution and the great weight is borne by those paying the graduated contribution, which stops short at about the highest skilled working wage. It has been like this ever since 1961 when the graduated contribution was first brought into operation.<br><br>
There are two ways round it. One is to increase the Exchequer supplement, on the basis of Government revenue being broadly progressive, so that more of the weight goes on the higher paid groups. The other way is to raise the ceiling at which graduated contributions are levied. I am aware that the objection is that this would impugn the insurance principle, that there is a relationship between graduated contribution and the level of graduated benefit. But the basis of that relationship is not so much actuarial as psychological, and it would be far better to raise the ceiling at which graduated contributions are paid to get a better pension plus redistribution of the cost. The higher paid would then pay an increase and the elderly would get more.<br><br>
Whichever method is used, it would make it easier in terms of the burden on the middle-range section of the population of skilled workers who, I accept, cannot be penalised by excess tax beyond a particular point because of the inflationary dangers. The only way to raise substantial extra sums by increasing the burden on those who, up till now, have borne a relatively small proportion of the burden in raising the revenue for national insurance benefits is by raising the level for Exchequer supplement or the ceiling for graduated contribution.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 150</span>
There seems, on grounds of cost, no reason why this could not be done. If it is done by other European countries, it could be done by us. I accept that there are counter-arguments which may be used, and lest I do not have the good fortune to catch your eye again, Sir Stephen, I will advance the answers to those arguments now.<br><br>
The first argument is that we are in an interim situation before the Strategy for Pensions is implemented, as the Government hope and intend, in 1975 or possibly the year after. There is no reason why the position cannot be improved before then. It would be misleading to suggest that when Strategy for Pensions is brought into operation, even though it will take much longer than the national superannuation proposals to come into operation—by the year 2019—the level of pensions provided will be adequate in the State reserve scheme.<br><br>
I have done some calculations which are based on the projection of average earnings up to the year 2019, on exactly the same principle as is adopted in the Strategy for Pensions White Paper, namely, a real increase of 3 per cent a year. I have assumed supplementary benefits maintain a constant relationship to the price-earnings index, which they have done for the last 25 years. I have used Table B on page 23 of the White Paper, and assumed that the basic part of the two-part pension will increase in line with prices and earnings. It is assumed, somewhat ambiguously, in the White Paper that benefits will keep up with earnings and that they will certainly keep up with prices. I have taken the optimistic view that benefits will keep up with earnings and added on the earnings in the graduated part as given in the table.<br><br>
On that basis in 1995, for a single person, supplementary benefit is likely to be £16.30 a week. If a man entered the scheme at 45 and was then earning £20 a week, it is likely that his level of pension, on the basis of this calculation, will be £13. If he enters when he is earning £30 a week, it is likely to be £14.40. If he enters when earning £42 a week, as a man of middle age, he is likely to receive £16.10.<br><br>
It will be seen immediately that all these levels are below the supplementary benefit level. If someone enters the scheme at the age of 35, and takes the pension in the year 2005, when supplementary bene-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0643">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 151</span>
fit can be expected to be £21.90, if he was earning £20 it is likely that his pension will be £19.80, and if he was earning £30 his pension would be £22.70 on the basis of this calculation.<br><br>
A person who spends the greater part of his working life in this scheme will still have a pension below the supplementary benefit line. The situation is worse for women as their earnings are lower. The examples I have given apply to the normal run of the population. There are supposed to be 7 million people in the State reserve scheme, who will receive a pension, even when they get it, which will be a long way below the supplementary benefit line.<br><br>
It is unfair to suggest that we cannot increase the pension because a major pension programme is soon to be operative. That pension scheme, for a significant minority in the State reserve scheme, will still offer a pension, on the basis of calculations derived from the Government's White Paper, below the supplementary benefit line. So that is one argument which I hope will not be put forward.<br><br>
A second argument concerns supplementary benefit. It is argued that not only can one receive supplementary benefit but one can also receive certain discretionary extras. These extras are well known. One can receive extra heating allowance, laundry costs can be paid in certain circumstances, and special diet payments, assistance with clothing and furniture, and in a few cases removal, are available. The value of these benefits is in all cases unknown. What are known are the facts about heating.<br><br>
As has been said recently on more than one occasion, the number of elderly people who receive the special extra discretionary heating allowance is less than 2 per cent. of the total. Of that percentage, only a tiny number, less than 1 per cent., receive the top rate of 75p a week, which is only about a third of actual average winter heating costs.<br><br>
It is entirely wrong to suggest that supplementary benefit is a flexible additional extra which can be given to pensioners to make up for an utterly inadequate pension. The same argument applies to the other discretionary additions, whether heating, a special diet allowance, clothing allowance or whatever. The additions are extremely exigu-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 152</span>
ous and are received by only a small number of people.<br><br>
There is the further point, which I have already mentioned, that up to 1 million pensioners, although they are eligible for supplementary benefit—apart from the ¾ million who receive it—do not claim it. For those people none of these extras apply.<br><br>
No doubt, we shall be told that it would be unreasonable to give a universal increase to a lot of people who, allegedly, do not need it on the ground that we have this flexible adjustment mechanism through supplementary benefit to raise the pension level.<br><br>
The third argument which, no doubt, will be raised concerns private pensions. Private pension schemes, occupational schemes, are extremely satisfactory if one is in a top hat scheme or one of the middle executive schemes. They are extremely unsatisfactory if one happens to be less than an average wage earner. The coverage among low paid manual workers is extremely small. That is readily acknowledged and well recognised. If one takes the lower income bracket of £14 to £16 a week, only 35 per cent. of manual workers are getting an occupational pension at this level.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 153</span>
of Amendments, are obvious, and we need not go over ground which has been argued for a number of years, but we are in a transitory stage because the Government are proposing longer-term proposals in their White Paper, and I respectfully submit that the detailed arguments which my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Meacher) is submitting, officially representing the Opposition, are necessary to demonstrate the weight and substance of this large group of Amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I fully appreciate the hon. Gentleman's submission. I have not attempted to intervene earlier. I appreciate the importance of the large group of Amendments which we are discussing, and how important it is that the full argument should be set out. But it occurred to me that it might be as well not to go fully into arguments which might or might not be advanced in rebuttal before the Minister has had a chance to put them. I have not said that anything is out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take the point, Sir Stephen. I do not want to go into the arguments in too great detail. It is not, as my hon. Friend has said, a matter of guess-work. We have heard the arguments put up before. We do not want them to be put again, because they are entirely inadequate. It is inadequate to say that the coverage of occupational pensions is increasing. According to the latest survey, that is not so. The positon seems to have stabilised and halted at a certain level. Such benefits may recompense for a low level of pension, but they cannot do that for the lowest paid. The coverage among the lowest paid is between one-third and two-fifths. It is utterly inadequate, not only because the coverage is low but because the size of benefit decreases the lower one goes in the income scale.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Malley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a narrow point, but my hon. Friend will wish to point out that these Amendments concern not only retirement pensioners but other large groups who, even if they were members of good occupational pension schemes, would find themselves in many cases without any kind of breakdown pension, apart from the occupational pension scheme which does not become payable until retirement. It is important that we should
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 154</span>
stress the need for the kind of increases which we are proposing in these Amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful. My hon. Friend's intervention emphasises the point. Occupational pension schemes have been heralded extensively by successive Conservative Governments as being an answer to a relatively parsiminous State sector. However, it is not unreasonable to point out that for the bottom third of the income scale they do not do that. In a particularly low pay area like Scotland, taking all ages and earning levels into account, not restricted to the lowest earning levels, the coverage of occupational schemes is less than half. According to the latest figures, it is 48.9 per cent. It is the poorer half who are excluded.<br><br>
I will say no more on that matter, but I hope that no excuse will be given for rejecting these Amendments, if that is in the Government's mind, on the ground that occupational pensions provide the necessary uprating.<br><br>
I do not more than point out the fourth argument which we have heard on many occasions, that the Government has brought in a range of extra benefits. Those benefits are welcome as far as they go. I am thinking particularly of the age addition to the pension and the invalidity allowance for the long-term disabled. There are a number of other additions which I will not go through. We accept them and we are glad of them as far as they go, but they go only a little way. If one totted up the total benefit which the extras confer over and above the previous situation, it is likely to be less than £1 million a year in terms of the numbers involved. When one considers the total number of welfare beneficiaries that is extremely small beer. No one can reasonably assert it is adequate.<br><br>
I conclude by drawing attention to two other points, which the Secretary of State made on Second Reading, which, I think, are likely to be raised. I shall briefly refer to them and comment.<br><br>
11.45 a.m.<br><br>
The Secretary of State said on Second Reading, after referring to the annual up-rating:
<br><blockquote><p>"The second is the benefit to a substantial number of pensioners which will come from the rent rebate system in the Housing Finance Bill"—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 18th May, 1972; Vol. 837, <i>c</i>. 719.]</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0645">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 155</span>
Certainly, that is an extra benefit which may go to a significant number of pensioners. It remains to be seen how many are prepared to take up a means-tested rent rebate. It essentially shifts the responsibility for covering rent from supplementary benefit to the local authority under the State scheme. The net gain to retirement pensioners and others is likely to be fairly small. Again, I hope that this point will not be raised as a reason why the pension neeed not be increased.<br><br>
We know that fair rents will involve more or less a doubling of rent, against which there will be rebates which in some cases will be substantially bigger than the present rebate and in some cases smaller. The rebates, on average, will probably provide for the payment of about half the increase, still leaving—though less so for retirement pensioners—some extra to be paid even after rebate has been granted.<br><br>
The last point referred to by the Secretary of State and to which I expect the Under-Secretary of State to refer is the tax credit proposal, which alters the situation markedly. One could argue that the pension in the interim does not matter so much if there is to be substantial assistance to pensioners under the tax credit proposal. One of the boons referred to by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his Budget speech was that the tax credit proposals would provide for a "substantial reduction" in the number of retirement pensioners forced to claim supplementary benefit. He implied that the benefit would be considerable. It can be expected that the Government will go ahead fairly rapidly with introducing the proposal and it is not, therefore, unreasonable for us to look at it.<br><br>
The key to the tax credit proposal is the level of the single person credit replacing the single person's allowance which, under the current Finance Bill, is £460. Since the Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the proposals would, by and large, remove all wage-earners from family income supplement, he implied a substantial uprating of the credit above the present level of allowances. I, therefore. expect that the single person credit will be of the order of £600 a year. That is a fairly generous assumption—it may be less.<br><br>
Even if it were at that level, the 30 per cent. difference between the uprated pension of £6.75 and this new single
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 156</span>
person credit of £600 is likely on my calculations to raise the pension plus credit to £8.20. That is still little more than halfway to the supplementary benefit line which, after October of this year for a single person, including £2.50 rent, will be £9.05. Again, although some automatic benefit will be given to pensioners under the tax credit proposals, they are in no sense an alternative to a pension increase because they still will not take pensioners to the supplementary benefit line, or even particularly near it.<br><br>
It has been rather a long speech, but but it is justified by the importance of the Amendment. Although I have concentrated on single retired pensioners, my argument applies to the whole range of other beneficiaries, of whom there are between 8 million and 9 million, constituting about one-sixth of our population. We are talking about the basic standard of living of the forgotten submerged one-sixth of the population. In those terms, I have not couched my argument in too extreme a fashion. I have had the arguments put to me in an extreme fashion by people who are perpetually exasperated by their total inability to make do at this level. They have all my sympathy. I do not know how people manage on this standard of living.<br><br>
The Amendment is modest in terms of the needs of that one-sixth of the population. It is modest in terms of the wealth of the country, and the fact that our wealth has doubled in the last 25 years whereas the pension has not increased in relation to national average earnings. It is modest in terms of the hand-out that has been given to other sectors of the community by the Government, and rightly so. It is modest in relation to the level of benefit which other countries less well off than we are manage to afford.<br><br>
We have heard a great deal of rhetoric from Government spokesmen about the wider community interests which need to be safeguarded in an inflationary age, and the determination which the Prime Minister is constantly articulating to protect the interests of the wider community. All we are asking in the Amendment is that there should at last be deeds to match that rhetoric.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boscawen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to answer all the points which have been
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0646">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 157</span>
put by the hon. Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Meacher). Were I to do so, the aims of my right hon. Friend to uprate pensions annually would never be realised. The argument of the hon. Gentleman would have been more convincing had he put down Amendments to Schedule 2. All his Amendments are related to Schedule 1, and there is no Amendment for uprating the flat rate contribution. It would have been easier for us to see the cost of the proposals in the Amendments to Schedule 1 had we known how the Opposition proposed to raise the sum required.<br><br>
It is all very well for the hon. Gentleman to suggest that the net cost would be only £850 million. If the net cost is about £450 for a pension increase of £1, my arithmetic shows that the cost of a pension increase of £2 would be twice £450 million, that amounts to £900 or £1,000 million. I cannot query the figures in detail—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The figures I gave were net of reductions in supplementary benefit which result from taking people off supplementary benefit, and also net of tax clawback. That is why the figure is slightly lower.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boscawen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A reduction in supplementary benefit would, surely, harm the lowest one-third of pensioners. To increase the pension by the amount proposed in the Amendment, and then to take away from those who most need it all supplementary benefit, I find most confusing. The point might have been more convincing had it been expressed in an Amendment.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman referred to certain European countries. I have looked at schemes in some European countries, from information obtainable in the Library. We in this country do a great deal better than many European countries in other ways. No other member of the EEC has a National Health Service which bears any comparison with ours. The National Health Service helps the elderly in many ways. On the Continent, contributions are usually substantially higher, as the hon. Gentleman admitted. The hon. Gentleman referred to the higher pensions paid in Italy. The highest figure, I think, was £6 50. He omitted to say that nearly 60 per cent. of pensioners in Italy are on
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 158</span>
the £4 minimum. It is easy to look at the figures theoretically and say that other countries in Europe do better than we do, but when we look at them more carefully we find that they do not do any better, and in many cases not nearly as well.<br><br>
In Sweden, for example, pensions for men and women are not payable until the age of 70. France has more means tests than we have and so does the Netherlands. With other hon. Members, including the hon. Member for Rhondda, West (Mr. Alec Jones), I went to Belgium last year where we spent a day looking at welfare schemes. We came away with the impression that, although Belgium had the interesting method of paying national pensions by the postman, the actual rates of benefit, except for certain sections of the community such as miners who had special priorities, were little, if at all, better than ours. But it is confusing and difficult to make comparisons.<br><br>
We should be chary of saying that we are badly off in comparison with EEC countries. If we take into account all the benefits, including the National Health Service and the fact that in other countries some benefits are not paid until a later age, and there is means-testing of widows' pensions, our record is pretty good.<br><br>
At our last Sitting, the hon. Member for Oldham, West and I got into an argument about how much inflationary damage had been done to pensioners over the past 10 years. He produced figures to show that the uprating proposed by the Government will not improve the actual purchasing power of the pension beyond the November 1969 figure. He said that the pension was raised to £5 in November 1969, and that it was believed that in November 1973, before next year's review, it would be eroded to about £4.80. That is not the right method of comparison.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman should have started with a figure before the uprating in November 1969, when he would have found that the then pension was £4.50 in actual terms, but in real terms about £4.04 or £4.05. He ought to compare like with like.<br><br>
12 noon.<br><br>
I think that there has been some improvement. The hon. Member may be right in saying that it is marginal, but it is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0647">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 159</span>
an improvement. We want to see that continued.<br><br>
The hon. Member made much of the ¾ million to 1 million pensioners who do not claim supplementary benefit. This is a great problem, and I agree that those who do not claim it are living at a very low level of income. This is a matter which, I hope, the tax credit system will deal with. Although there is a means test of a kind, it is not a means test that they will dislike as much as they dislike the present one. The hon. Member is quite right, and we want to push on with this system because it will help those many pensioners who do not claim the supplementary benefit but who could have it if they would claim.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Meacher</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Since the hon. Member has raised that point, I hope that he heard what I said at the end. Even if the tax credit system were introduced, it would take the single person little more than half-way to the supplementary benefit line. That is based purely on my hypothesis on how it is likely to work, but I cannot believe it will be more generous than that in terms of the single person, so it offers no alternative. But the hon. Member has answered one of his own points: why does one suggest an increase in pension and leave people on the supplementary benefit lie where they were? The point is that the ¾ million to 1 million getting the supplementary benefit would have the increase in the basic pension, and it is precisely those who are the poorest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boscawen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I see the force of the argument about those who are entitled and do not claim. We should wait until the tax credit system is introduced, because it could answer that problem if it is properly geared. This is one of the points which we will have to watch.<br><br>
The whole argument is based on the idea that, if one up-rated the pension by this large sum, it would be relatively easy to find such a sum of money from the Exchequer, which, it has been suggested, has given money out to taxpayers who do not really require it.<br><br>
One should look back at what happened when the Exchequer was taking a very large sum of money from the taxpayer, taking £3,000 million more than is taken today. The truth of the matter is that the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 160</span>
then Government found that they could not distribute it and give the sort of higher pension that the hon. Member suggests. The last Government's rate of pensions was no more than one-fifth of national average earnings, although they were taking £3,000 million more in taxation.<br><br>
It is no good the hon. Member saying that things were difficult at the time, with the balance of payments and all that. The Labour Government were still continuing with schemes like the Concorde, the RB211 and others, which required vast Exchequer injections—£250 million for Concorde, and so on. They were taking £3,000 million more in taxation, but were not able to give more to pensioners to raise the level higher than one-fifth of national average earnings.<br><br>
A lot has been said about priorities. I have heard the Opposition say several times that the Government's priorities are not theirs. The hon. Member for Rother-ham (Mr. O'Malley) charmed us on this side earlier with blandishments about back benchers who were not in the House in the last Parliament. I was not, and neither was the hon. Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Meacher). We have a clean sheet on this. But when Conservatives tried on three occasions to introduce pensions for the over-80s, the right hon. Lady the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle) and the hon. Member for Rother-ham voted against them, the hon. Member for Rotherham voting against them on all three occasions. Then, the cost would have been only £18 million. At the time, they were buying Phantom fighters from America. Five Phantom fighters would have provided the £18 million for the over-80s. It seems that there is one rule when one is in Government and one when one is in Opposition. I hope that the hon. Member for Oldham, West, although he has a clean sheet on this matter, will remember that if the nation ever again suffers the misfortune of his party being the Government.<br><br>
I say a word now to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary. We are not satisfied with the pension at one-fifth of national average earnings. It is not nearly enough. We thoroughly approve that there is to be an up-rating annually now to take account of inflation. That is a most desirable move on the right lines. But I want to see us go further. I want an undertaking that will give the pensioner a higher stake in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0648">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 161</span>
the rising standard of living annually as well as an up-rating to meet cost of living increases. This is something which we should all aim for, and I am sure that my hon. Friends on the back benches will support me in asking the Under-Secretary to give an undertaking that he will give serious consideration to giving such an increase, which will mean a genuine rise in the standard of living over and above that which takes inflation into account.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sydney Bidwell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I warmly welcome the concluding remarks of the hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Boscawen). I run the risk, Sir Stephen, of your ruling me out of order by drawing his attention to my Amendment, which does precisely what he wants. Perhaps he could add his name to it, and we could then in this Committee join in public admonition and criticism of the shortcomings of the former Administration as well, not in their balance of payments problem years and years of economic difficulty but when they had surmounted those burdens just prior to the last General Election.<br><br>
As I have already said, and will probably say again, they should have done something substantial about the relationship between the basic State retirement pension and national average earnings.<br><br>
It is not easy to make a short speech because we are here considering virtually the whole of Schedule 1. There is a relationship between one benefit and another, we see the recurring sum of £6.75 and the increase to £8 running like a fine thread through the Amendments. There has always been an historical interrelationship between benefits. When a Government move towards putting up the basic State retirement pension, the increase usually has more to do with intervening rises in the cost of living than with a substantial improvement in benefit.<br><br>
It is necessary to go back to the terms of reference of the basic State retirement pension, which is allied to the basic unemployment and sickness benefits which stand at the same figure. We have to have regard to the whole range of benefits. I hope that these debates will be regarded as the old-age pensioners debate. That is what I would like it to be known as, and I think it will be.<br><br>
It is a difficult problem. There are priorities, and we are juggling with an amount in the kitty. But there are various
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 162</span>
ways in which we can swell that kitty. My hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Meacher) has made a most penetrating analysis of the whole situation, which it will be difficult to emulate, because he brings to the House a fund of experience of research in this field. I believe that he is a statistician as well. He leaves us rather flat-footed if we seek to better the skill which he brings to these matters.<br><br>
My hon. Friend has put before us an unanswerable case for a promise to be given to the Committee. We are dealing with the problem here in greater depth than we could in other circumstances. I do not envy the Under-Secretary his task if he attempts to crystallise what has been said, and I imagine that he does not in-ten to speak at the same length in reply as my hon. Friend did. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear".] If the Under-Secretary does it adequately, he will find it necessary to do so.<br><br>
The Schedule covers a large global sum and applies to a large number of people. I hate to use the word "assist", because that word is detested. But, if the Under-Secretary puts his mind to it, he may become the first pensions Minister to make a real move which would give his name a fine place in the pensions history of this country. He has an admirable opportunity to do that in the short period left to this Government.<br><br>
I do not want to say now anything which would encroach on the speech I intend to make when I move Amendment No. 20, when I will seek to get us away from the ghastly situation that my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Meacher) described.<br><br>
12.15 p.m.<br><br>
I am glad to see that the hon. Member for Billericay (Mr. McCrindle) has returned. I thought that he had gone to catch a bus to Clapham to find out what the man on it felt about giving the pensioner a square deal. If so, I am sure that he had some rude answers about the Government's failure. Of course, most men are now in cars rather than buses, biting their nails and building up their overheads. But I am sure that the average man would want to give pensioners the money.<br><br>
Some of us think that we could put our money on the verdict of a referendum on the Common Market, but an even safer
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0649">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 163</span>
bet would be a referendum on mobilising national resources, not just the resources of the National Insurance Fund, to give a better deal to a whole generation of people—I do not apologise for using some of the words that I used in introducing a Ten Minute Rule Bill—who sweated as far fewer do today and who did not have the opportunities of decent occupational pension schemes.<br><br>
When I was a railway worker, we got an occupational scheme only with nationalisation. We called it a tuppenny-ha'penny scheme, a description that applies to all schemes of nationalised industries. One cannot live on the proceeds of such a pension and the basic retirement pension, one still has to have supplementary benefit to cope with constant inflation.<br><br>
Old workmates of mine and their wives have great pride about this. They believe in taking only the pension for which they have themselves provided. If the cost of living rises, they have the embarrassment of finding at the check-out in the Co-op that their money does not buy what it bought a few weeks before, and they have to decide what can be discarded as a luxury. I am sure that the Minister's Department has built up figures about that.<br><br>
Raising the pension by this modest amount would help some people who are not in this situation, but it will be worth it. Their purchasing power must be limited, since they will not live for ever. The forecast is that the aged proportion of our population will decline after 1980, and there will not be the same relative burden on the work force. But is it, anyway, the burden that Tory thinking suggests? We look to a growth in the national product every year, and in real terms there may be this improvement.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Boscawen) chided us for not saving where the money would come from. But that is putting the cart before the horse. If the Minister agreed to the Amendments, I would suggest to my hon. and right hon. Friends that we put the details in, perhaps, Schedule 2.<br><br>
There is a myth, as the hon. Member for Wells showed, that working people are averse to paying extra contributions. At the last Labour Party Conference, Mr. Jack Jones, General Secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union, the largest in the country, said that if the pensions were raised as he desired, he would recommend that his members
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 164</span>
should pay their share of the increase. But they would have to know that the contributions were being directed towards the required purposes.<br><br>
If hon. Members opposite believe that myth, they do not know the British working class. It has never been hard to collect money from them to improve the lot of old people. The hon. Member for Melton (Miss Pike), in her one contribution, testified to that, but that was in the voluntary field, in "do-gooding", and we want to put it in their pockets as of right.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle) will be back in the Government perhaps sooner than many people think. After all, the Prime Minister told the Conservative Women's Conference that he had exhausted his programme and run out of ideas in two years. That led many people to speculate that an election might be in the offing. One of the great issues in that case would be the question of harmonisation of social security with other European countries by acceding to the Treaty of Rome, together with the effects of inflation on old-age pensions and the incomes of the sick and low paid workers. Although I am not normally a gambling man, I would be prepared to put my shirt on a Labour victory.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patrick Cormack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member would lose it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Fortescue</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</span></p>
<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bidwell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I like many of the Tory Members who sit for marginal constituencies. I have grown quite attached to them in a personal sense. It is difficult to make enemies in this place.<br><br>
We hope that the Under-Secretary will say precisely why the Government cannot see their way to complying with the requests made in our Amendments. I do not want to repeat, if I can avoid it, what my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Oldham, West said in a pretty lengthy speech. If I had spoken first, it would have been at greater length.<br><br>
In the document, Strategy for Pensions, what is meant by the term which recurs throughout, "basic pension"? In the jargon, the basic pension means at present £6, with 75p added at the beginning of October, and £1.20 added for a couple. But to what is it basic? Is it to provide
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0650">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 165</span>
for basic needs? No. Otherwise it would make a nonsense of the supplemental system. The figure is to go up to £10.90, but what does it apply to? A formula is being worked out in relation to the Housing Finance Bill which takes the basic necessities of life and then keeps people up to a certain level by means testing. But benefits of this kind under national insurance are not basic at all; the term means nothing.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary was kind enough to listen to my speech introducing my Ten Minute Bill. One trouble here that there has not been any anchorage. I do not pull any punches in saying that the previous Labour Government did not do what I said should be done. I was not quiet about that. I put my views forward at the Parliamentary Labour Party, and some of them were picked up in the Press at the time. I have not been hiding my light under a bushel. I told my right hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Stetchford (Mr. Roy Jenkins) that I was disappointed, and he said that that was not the year for review. I welcome the new annual review system. It is on the cards that we should have had it under a Labour Government after the last General Election.<br><br>
The review is not much to write home about if the improvements are not in real terms. They are not, and that is the whole burden of my hon. Friend's argument. In the document, Strategy for Pensions, these words are used:
<br><blockquote><p>"In a scheme where the basic pension is flat-rate the level of the pension is crucial".</p></blockquote>
I do not know whether that must necessarily mean that the level of flat rate pension benefit is crucial. The Under-Secretary does not propose to abolish it. If he does not, he should make proposals to make substantial real improvements on the lines of the proposals I shall be presenting to the Committee later.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Bos-cawen), seemed not fully to comprehend some of my hon. Friend's arguments. He referred to the lag in the national State retirement pension as it applies to average national earnings, which I dealt with in my speech on my Bill. As the hon. Member for Wells does not understand that—he seems to be the liveliest hon. Member on that side so far—I assume that other hon. Members who have not made the same contribution do not necessarily
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 166</span>
know more than he does.<br><br>
There is a table which one can get from the Library, and perhaps from the Department of Health and Social Security, on the relativity of the national State retirement benefit to the national average wage. It is a fact of life that it has hovered around 20 per cent., sometimes going a little above and sometimes well short. I shall not worry the Committee by reading the whole table, because it would take a long time and would not profit anybody. Hon. Members can get all the documents and then they will be as well-informed as we are on the increase in State retirement pension as it relates to national average earnings in real terms from 1965.<br><br>
I accept entirely the argument that there will be a lagging behind. We have had the titivating piece in the Chancellor's speech every year when he puts up State retirement pensions. He mentions it in April, when it sounds all right and sounds as if he is throwing a few crumbs from the rich to the poor, but by the time autumn comes it has been overtaken by the rise in the cost of living.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Billericay (Mr. McCrindle) has considerable expertise on pension schemes and insurance fund arrangements for employers and employees. He must have made some study of the State pension entitlement as well as of the Labour Party's ideas for national superannuation. I hope that we can move away from acrimony which was developing in the speech of the hon. Member for Wells, who was doing his best.<br><br>
I am not crowing about what was done under Labour, and I cannot crow about what is being done now under this Government; but I hope that the Government will seriously look at this and try to persuade the Secretary of State to move away from the nonsense suggestion that people will not be prepared to pay.<br><br>
I suppose that it is an argument that on Schedule 2 we could have proffered Amendments to show how the money could be gathered together. The TUC has ideas. I do not know whether the CBI has, but the TUC, in its economic review for 1972, demands £8 a week and £14 for a couple, and says the new formula for a collecting system should be 19/20ths of the national insurance to be covered from the State and employers and l/20th from employees. But there is no rigidity about that kind of figure. We now have

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 167</span>
18 per cent. collected through the national Exchequer system, and the rest in roughly equal amounts from workers and employers through work pay arrangements.<br><br>
The TUC has a view, and it is not surprising that it suggested that the weight be put on industry. That seems to apply in the Common Market, although we do not want to have a slavish following of their arrangements. They vary, as the hon. Member for Wells pointed out. I found it hard, when preparing my speech on my Ten Minute Bill, to make comparisons. They seem odious in many ways. The general level of benefit seems quite high compared with ours, but that does not mean that we should slavishly follow their collecting system.<br><br>
When the British worker has to rub shoulders later on more closely with German and Italian workers, he will make more comparison about the kind of benefits they get from their pension arrangements. Poverty and old age have gone together in this country.<br><br>
12.45 p.m.<br><br>
I have before me a lot of facts and figures. They are well known to the Under-Secretary and to us on this side. I doubt that they are equally well known to hon. Members opposite. I am not being offensive when I say that. When one is preparing for Committee work on the Opposition side, usually the members are collected together because they have revealed an interest in the matter to come before the Committee. That would not necessarily be so on the Government side. I do not mean that offensively. It has happened to me. When I first came here, I was sent behind the Minister in charge of the Land Commission Bill. I learned a great deal listening to the lawyers, but it bored me to tears, and I did not emerge as a foremost expert on the matter at the end of the proceedings. However, we are not here going into the great complications of betterment levy, of exchanging little parcels of land, carving off a bit of land on the edge of a street, and so on. We are dealing with the fundamentals of people's lives and the whole social insurance structure.<br><br>
The case has been made for the pensioners. If today's <i>Daily Telegraph</i> is anything to go by, we are in for further shocks in price increases. When the increase is paid in the autumn, it will be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 168</span>
nothing to boast about. We cannot boast about the annual review. I noticed on the Government side, at the time of the Chancellor's announcement of the increases in old-age pensions, a sense of euphoria as it was though it meant a serious improvement in real terms. The Committee's discussion has already blown that sky high. The hon. Member is in the medical profession, the Member for Norwich, South (Dr. Stuttaford) must constantly meet people who have fallen by the wayside, the aged particularly, and I am sure that it is his desire to offer a real improvement. In his heart of hearts, if he had to do the job, would he accept the 75p, or the £1.20 for a couple, as good enough? It is not good enough. We can afford to do much better than that.<br><br>
Now, a reference to unemployment. It is the basic rate at which a worker has to look. The rate will be £6.75 if he exhausts his earning-related benefit after six months. Long-term unemployment is increasing. We do not want it to increase. The present Government, although, historically, Tory Governments have been associated with unemployment, do not want unemployment. It has been in the minds of many when voting at election times that a Labour Government are much more likely—I put it no higher—to sustain a full employment economy, to make human use of human beings.<br><br>
I do not know that that is true. After all, the father of the present Secretary of State for Employment made a political reputation on his concern about unemployment. I would not like to say that, nowadays, it is the ascendant political and economic motive in the Tory Party to think in terms of a pool of unemployment. That was definitely the view of the Cohen Committee, the "three wise men". The advice it then preferred to the Conservative Government was not mass unemployment but a nice, handy ½ million to 1 million, so that they could better discipline the workers who were in work. It was thought that it would damp down the trade unions if one thought in terms of three workers to two jobs. If there are three jobs and two workers, the bargaining relationship changes. But that is not the current thinking in the Conservative Party, because the working population will not stand for that any longer.<br><br>
Let us not assume that we shall have growing calls upon the unemployment fund. We shall get back to a full employ-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0652">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 169</span>
ment economy, and return to a situation when it is exceedingly unusual for a man to be out of work for long or be likely to exhaust his earnings-related benefit.<br><br>
We shall come to that later, but it must exercise our minds when we think in terms of an improvement of the basic benefit. It is not a charity. It is something to which workers contribute. We had a slogan in the early days of the Labour Party, "Work or full maintenance". To some extent, the Welfare State has gone towards that, but it has not quite got there.<br><br>
We do not now read so many stories about the work-shy in the Conservative-biased national newspapers. We do not read so many stories about malingerers, which we had in great number at the time of the Labour Government. At that time the Press was attempting to show that the Labour Government were incompetent, and were shelling out millions of pounds. We had Tory Central Office speeches from candidates up and down the country—I had to put up with it in my constituency—about the need for public expenditure to be reduced.<br><br>
There are many aspects of public expenditure which people want to cut back upon, but this is not one of them. This country is proud of the development of it welfare and national insurance facilities, which were put under way by the postwar Labour Government from 1945 to 1951. Those were exciting years, in which the whole situation was transformed. They were not the original thoughts of only the Labour Party. An eminent Liberal, Beveridge, was a good deal responsible for the whole concept of national insurance benefits.<br><br>
Those benefits have been eroded by inflation. They have not kept pace with improvements in the national standard of living. As my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West pointed out in his major contribution to this debate, we have doubled our gross national product over
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 170</span>
a lengthy period up to the present, but we have kept many of our arrangements and entitlements under national insurance right where they are.<br><br>
The charge against the Government is that they are going even further back. The national Exchequer contribution, expressed as a ratio of contributions to the kitty, is moving back to something less than the 15 per cent. projected by my hon. Friend.<br><br>
The task may be difficult for an Under-Secretary or a Minister. If my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle) had the job, the same practical considerations would apply. There would have to be stand-backs in various directions, and priority would be given in other directions. My right hon. Friend will remember that there was an argument in the Tribune Group, after the balance of payments had been put right, about what the Chancellor should do. The Chancellor had the launching pad from which to do something when he got free of the edicts of the International Monetary Fund. How was he to set about these improvements? We had mixed feelings about it. Some of us wanted improvements in family allowances. Some wanted a bit more for the sick, and others wanted old-age pensioners to be given more. Some had the idea that old-age pensioners should not be the first in the queue. I do not take that view. I believe that they should be the first in the queue. All credit will be given to the Government who relieve them of their present situation.</span></p>

This is a substantial debate, and the Committee may feel that we might adjourn now rather than start a fresh speech in the few minutes remaining.<br><br>
Debate adjourned.—[<i>Mr. Dean</i>.]</span></p>
