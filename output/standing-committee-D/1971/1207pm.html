<p>4.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denis Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When we adjourned this morning we were discussing Amendment No. 15, in page 2, line 8, leave out subsections (6) to (8) and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(6) On and after 1st April 1974 every district shall consist of one or more areas to be known as communities which shall be established in accordance with the following paragraphs:—
<ol>
<li>the area of each borough existing immediately before that date shall on that date become a community of the district in which it is comprised and shall be known by the same name as the borough's;</li>
<li>the area of each urban district then existing which is wholly comprised in a district shall on that date become a community of that district and shall be known by the same name as the urban district's;</li>
<li>the area of each rural parish then existing shall on that date become a community of the district in which it is comprised and shall be known by the same name as the parish's;</li>
<li>in the areas of such boroughs and urban districts which, on and after 1st April 1974, are comprised in more than one county or more than one district there shall be established separate communities for those parts falling into each county or district;</li>
<li>in the areas of those rural parishes which are in existence immediately prior to 1st April 1974 and are divided according to Part IV of Schedule 1 of this Act, there shall be established as communities as specified in the said Part IV."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
This is a matter which we on the Opposition benches regard as of great importance, namely the question of the establishment of local community councils, or, as I prefer to call them, neighbourhood community councils. I know, Sir Stephen, that you did not have the advantage of hearing the excellent arguments which I used, and I am tempted to repeat them for your benefit, but I shall
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 252</span>
resist this temptation in the knowledge that you are an ardent reader of the affairs of this Committee. It will suffice to say that this involves the whole question of involvement of the public in local affairs and local determination. Illustrations used included such matters as roads and shopping, on which people could have a real and effective say in how their environment was determined.<br><br>
I was at the point of dealing with the shopping argument when we adjourned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Michael Haseltine)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman had just done it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary of State tells me that I had, in fact, completed my argument. The advantage of having a very good lunch is that one remembers important points one had forgotten to make earlier and one wishes to return to the argument. I will return to one point on the shopping expedition, because I was attracted during lunch by the sight of the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, who had advised us how important it was to "shop around" in connection with prices—but I would be out of order if I went into this subject.<br><br>
I should like to mention an experience I recently had when I visited the new town of Runcorn, about a month ago. I toured around and I was stopped by quite a large number of people who drew my attention to the fact that in the planning and operation of that new town the housewives had no effective choice. There were far too few shops, very few corner shops, and there was no choice at all in terms of supermarkets or as between supermarkets and the co-operative movement.<br><br>
When I visited Redditch on an earlier occasion, which my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove (Mr. Terry Davis) will recall, the same situation prevailed. It seems to me that here is a contribution which the housewives could most effectively make, through their community council, on the question of the amount of shopping facilities available to them, the ability to compare prices, and how effectively to implement the Minister of Agriculture's "shop around" policy. I think this is an argument very much in favour of the neighbourhood council philosophy.<br><br>
The next and perhaps the most dramatic of all the arguments for neighbour-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0146">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 253</span>
hood councils is in regard to housing policy. I see that in Birmingham—and I know this happens in many of our large conurbations—there is a dramatic deterioration in the conditions of whole roads and areas as a result of the housing policies implemented by local authority housing committees. They decide, for example, in Birmingham that they will have to re-house what are comfortably known colloquially as problem families. In deciding to re-house problem families by putting two or three problem families in a road without adequate social supervision, this can play absolute havoc with the neighbourhood environmental standards as it affects the lives of the people around them.<br><br>
Here is something on which I receive deputations again and again, and I know from talking to my hon. and right hon. Friends that they find the same sort of problem. They find there is a very real concern evidenced by people on the whole question of the social supervision of difficult families. In the case particularly of large-scale immigration into an area, which happens to be true of my constituency, and many parts of Birmingham, the situation is even more pronounced. There appears to be no adequate social supervision, no means by which neighbours with a sense of grievance—not involving colour prejudice, but people with different standards and with a different approach to living—may effectively express such grievance. If there were community councils, serviced by community officers, as the Opposition would wish, it would be possible to call on expert professional advice to solve many of the problems with which ordinary people on the receiving end of such difficulties find themselves confronted.<br><br>
There should be, within our community, trained social officers servicing the community councils and dealing with the problems which I have outlined. Not the least part of my argument in favour of such councils is the belief that such a development would be a magnificent insurance policy for this country, and particularly for the large conurbations.<br><br>
Additionally, when one examines the housing aspect, I should have thought that the inability in large areas of many tenants to get their repairs dealt with might be effectively taken up by the com-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 254</span>
munity councils. I held an advice bureau in my constituency last Friday evening, which lasted for four hours, and approximately 70 to 80 per cent. of the cases fell within that category. People come to me because they think that there is some magic about a Member of Parliament which does not exist in respect of other people. Nevertheless, there should be someone available constantly to investigate their problems, and deal with them on their behalf.<br><br>
Thus, while community councils would not be able to determine the question of housing policy, they would at least afford an opportunity for local citizens to find an expression of opinion as to how they were affected by the housing policy in their locality.<br><br>
Apart from housing, I think that the next most important subject—some would argue the most important—affecting the daily lives of families is the quality of education available in the schools. I confess that this subject gives me cause for growing concern. There is much evidence that the more sophisticated and advanced our educational service, the greater the difficulties at the end of the day, as far as the mass of young people are concerned. I believe that if there were community councils, which could involve themselves in the quality of education in their local schools, nothing but good would result.<br><br>
It used to be fashionable to deal with this problem by means of the creation of parent-teacher associations. During my five years as Under-Secretary of State for Education I detected, regrettably, a growing feeling among the teaching profession, either that the parent-teacher associations had outlived their usefulness, or that it was perhaps not quite the right means of public involvement in the work of the schools. However, anyone who believes, as I believe, in the totality of and the liberal approach to education must automatically reach the conclusion that there must be public involvement in the educational system, and an awareness of what is taking place. People should be concerned about the quality of education which is offered in schools.<br><br>
I will cite, without apology, an illustration from my own constituency. I am sorry to say that the 11-plus examination is still in existence in Birmingham. [Hon. Members: "Disgusting."] It is disgusting. I regard it as obscene. However, I do not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0147">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 255</span>
want to follow that track too far. It is interesting to note, however, that on a breakdown of figures as to who gets through the 11-plus examination in Birmingham, the children of the wards in my constituency have only a one-in-five chance of getting through the 11-plus examination compared with children in the outer wards of Birmingham.<br><br>
This is monstrous, and it cannot be defended by anybody. I do not think anybody in this Committee would want to defend it, but it raises all sorts of questions about the relative quality of education in the schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Member. The hon. Member is arguing the case for the necessity of having community councils which would involve the public generally in these subjects. There is no objection whatever to him making a reference to subjects such as education, housing and so on, but it would be unfair if I were to let him go on to particularise too much upon a particular subject or a particular area. Other hon. Members might be tempted to follow his example. Let us discuss the subject that we are supposed to be discussing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that if I get out of order you will tell me, Sir Stephen; but as you will appreciate, I am trying to illustrate the case for the Amendment from hard practical experience. I think this must be in order, just to illustrate that I am not dwelling over-long on any of these subjects which are before the Committee.<br><br>
I was coming to my final point. I got myself into trouble with the teaching profession two or three years ago when I undertook a survey on this question of the 11-plus and how it found expression in my constituency. For children educated in Small Heath as compared with children educated in Hall Green, for example, the chances of getting through the 11-plus are one in five. Even within the Small Heath ward itself, which is a very self-contained ward, the chances very enormously. I actually had two schools at each end of the same road. The school at one end of the road got only one child through the 11-plus in one year, whereas the school at the other end of the road got about 50 per cent. of its children through the 11-plus. That suggests that there is a great difference in the quality of educa-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 256</span>
tion between those two schools.<br><br>
A community council dealing with this sort of neighbourhood project, would take account of these factors. I am the last person to think that the professional competence of the teaching profession should be undermined. However, the teaching profession, like any other profession, ought to be reasonably accountable for the quality of the work that it does in the schools. I put it no higher than that.<br><br>
I come now to the question of the application of the Skeffington Report. This is another area in which the community councils could play a significant part in enabling people to reach sensible decisions. The Committee will recall that the Skeffington Committee, which was set up by my late colleague Mr. Arthur Skeffington, did a magnificent job in trying to advise us and laying down the guidelines as to how we could involve at local participaton level the ordinary community in the principles of planning as it applies to their neighbourhood.<br><br>
The Government seem to be moving away from the principles of Skeffington. We have heard very little of it since this Government came into office. When major planning decisions are being made which affect the lives of ordinary people, whether it be by drawing lines on a map, which produces blight and so on, or disturbs people's everyday lives, the people ought to be consulted. I am not saying the people should have a right to determine, but they have a right to have their voice heard.<br><br>
4.45 p.m.<br><br>
I know of no more effective way of bringing this about than by community councils. People could come to their community relations officers and express an opinion on a whole range of planning questions. They do not have to be major questions. Minor questions are of importance. I should like to give an example—the provision of a juke box in a fish and chip shop. It appears to be a growing practice that shops of all descriptions have juke boxes in them, and they can cause enormous offence to other people in the neighbourhood. By the time the licence has been granted, those people know nothing about it. They go to sleep one evening and wake up soon after to the noise of music from the juke box.<br><br>
This is a field in which community
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0148">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 257</span>
councils could act. If it were their task to say, "If this licence is granted, it will cause a disturbance in this neighbourhood. Therefore, on behalf of the neighbourhood, we are objecting before it is too late", this would be a justifiable case for action by community councils in everyday planning decisions as well as broad planning decisons. I have completed my list of examples of cases in which community councils can play an effective part in determining the everyday lives of ordinary people in this country.<br><br>
I want to deal with two other points. The first relates to financing. As the Opposition view community councils, we regard it as a a vital principle that they should be independent of all extraneous forces. They should offer an independent opinion. They should be consulted over the range of questions that I have mentioned. As a result of being consulted and bringing neighbourhoods together, they should be able to influence decisions. This would be first class. But they could not do this unless they were independently financed.<br><br>
No one wants the situation where a neighbourhood community council had to obtain its money from the local authority and there was even a breath of suggestion that "Unless you toe the line and work in accordance with the policy of our local authority, we shall be able to take financial sanctions against you in the financing operation of the community council". Therefore, in the financing of community councils, we wish to see that degree of independence, whether by precepting arrangements or some other way, which totally assures the independence of the community council.<br><br>
Finally, there is a range of public authorities on which it is increasingly difficult to get men and women to serve and for which the community council would be the right body to nominate members. The case of school managers comes to mind immediately. Nothing but good can come from having representatives of neighbourhood community councils serving as school managers.<br><br>
The same applies to hospital management committees. Anyone who has served on a hospital management committee knows that there are critical decisions of priority to be taken. Given a situation of a dearth of finance available, the views of the local populace whch is using the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 258</span>
hospital would be of great value in taking those decisions and also in making a case to regional hospital boards for more adequate finance. I have never met matrons or other hospital authorities who would not have welcomed a greater involvement of the public in their affairs. It can do nothing but good. In the minds of many people, especially the elderly, there is still this mental blockage about going into a hospital or institution. The natural day-to-day involvement of the community council in the hospital would bring nothing but good dividends for the National Health Service.<br><br>
One could use the same argument about the management of old people's homes and children's homes. Wherever there are these institutions which are needed by society to service the sick, the elderly and least well-off members of society, there are tremendous dividends to be obtained by having a local neighbourhood involvement within the management of those institutions.<br><br>
It seems to us, therefore, on all these counts—of the policy decisions to be made, the degree of representation that can be obtained, the involvement in amenity and leisure facility, and the local population—there is an outstanding argument in favour of the Amendment which I have moved this afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It might be of assistance if I reminded the Committee that with this Amendment we are discussing the following Amendments:—</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I say at once that it is unusual for a Minister to rise at this early stage in the deliberations, and I do it in no way to curtail the debate. I may be able to say something to help the general line of discussion, in order that we may have a constructive debate.<br><br>
In the light of that general reason for rising it might not even be appropriate to comment on the speech of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell). Perhaps I could leave that until I have replied to the de-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 262</span>
bate, since the hon. Member has anticipated something which I may now wish to say.<br><br>
I thank you, Sir Stephen, for grouping the large number of Amendments in one debate so that we can have a wide-ranging and constructive discussion on the important subject of the future role of parishes, where they are to be and where they are not to be, the sort of parishes that they should be, and the sort of powers and legal framework within which they should operate. The group of Amendments centres around Clause 1 (6) to (8). The first group provides, under subsection (6), for the continuation of the rural parishes, as they now exist throughout the country, to be known as parishes. So far as England is concerned, that is the purpose of subsection (6).<br><br>
The only matter to which I need refer is that that is subject to Part IV of Schedule 1, which deals with the relatively small number of cases where certain parishes have now been split by the new county lines, or the new metropolitan district lines. In this case we are providing for the split parishes to become two parishes and then to have a continuity of their own.<br><br>
Under subsection (8) we deal with the position of the boroughs in the rural districts set up by the 1933 or 1958 Acts. The intention is that these organisations shall continue not as boroughs but as parishes. Subsection (8) brings that into effect. They will have not mayors but chairmen of councils, and they will have a parish meeting, which hey do no have at the moment.<br><br>
The Bill then deals with the way in which the Government, at the time of publishing the Bill, feel it right to cope with the problem—to which I know a large number of hon. Gentlemen wish to refer and which has been the subject of a variety of different solutions put forward by Amendments, arising from those bodies which are now authorities of one sort or another but which, as a result of the introduction of two-tier system of government at a bigger scale than the existing structure provides for, will cease to be local authorities. Obviously, this has given rise to anxiety from people pointing to free-standing communities which will not, as at the moment when the new provisions come into force on 1st April, 1974, have any formal structure within which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0151">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 263</span>
the legitmate interests of the people living in those areas can be represented.<br><br>
It was our intention that this matter should be dealt with, first, by giving the new district authorities which will come into being on 1st April, 1974, the duty to review the communities within their districts with a view to putting forward suggestions to the Boundary Commission for the creation of new parishes where it was felt that a community had been inadvisedly deprived of the community structure which people are arguing for in one way or another.<br><br>
As the Bill is drafted, the Boundary Commission itself may initiate an inquiry into the creation of new parishes. Indeed, if the Commission or the districts do not undertake a satisfactory inquiry and put forward satisfactory proposals, it is up to the parishes themselves to complain and to ask for a review, which could lead to the creation of parishes.<br><br>
That was the broad outline which seemed to us sensible in order that we could have a definite break at 1st April, 1974, when a considerable number of existing authorities would cease to exist and before which the wave of authorities expected to be created under this group of Amendments would not come into existence. It was a deliberate decision that there should be this gap. It seemed to us, for reasons which seem self-evident, that there were virtues in having the gap.<br><br>
I suppose that the principal reason was to concentrate on the main purpose of the Bill, which was to bring new authorities into being and to get them off to as encouraging a start, free of diversions, as possible, in the interests of the proposed new structure of local government. That was the over-riding consideration. Whilst it is very fine to have the grandiose concept which justifies that attitude, it is easy to lose sight of the legitimate interests of the free-standing communities which may have been dispossessed of borough status. Therefore, the first question for the Committee is whether there should be some provision for free-standing boroughs and towns to continue as parishes with no hiatus.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) spoke about neighbourhood communities. He spoke from his great personal experience at both parliamentary and local government level. I got the feeling that he was talking about communities within urban
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 264</span>
areas, whereas the Amendments would not create those neighbourhood councils, as they are generally called. That is not in any way to say that his points were not valid, but such councils would not come into being as a result of the Amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: New Clause No. 1 gives the Secretary of State the same powers in England as the Secretary of State for Wales has under new Clause No. 29(3). That would give him power to make councils for parts of urban areas, covering precisely the point made by my hon. Friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is. a perfectly fair observation which I am sure the hon. Member will wish to develop. There are difficulties because of the different timing in reorganisation in Wales and in England. There is a difference between the division of urban communities into neighbourhood councils and small freestanding boroughs having new parish councils, which I am now talking about. If there should be parishes to replace the dispossessed boroughs, the difficulty arises in trying to find the criteria for deciding which communities should get the new parishes, in the Bill, for example, or by some method that we might devise between now and the coming into existence of the new local authorities.<br><br>
Perhaps I could outline some of the problems that I think the Committee might wish to consider and that will have to be solved before we can make decisions. First, if a district was to comprise largely the dispossessed borough, but had added to it a relatively small area, geographically and in terms of population, to create a parish for the dispossessed borough would be to create an organisation which would dominate the whole of the new district and would be seen to act as a pressure group within the district. This could be seen to act substantially against the interests of a relatively small number of people who had been added to the dispossessed borough in order to create the new district. The proportion of a new district that could be allowed to be part of a new parish without prejudicing the opportunity for cohesion of the new district is the first question.<br><br>
5.0 p.m.<br><br>
Secondly, if one is to create new parishes for dispossessed boroughs, there
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0152">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 265</span>
is a danger—for reasons not totally in line with the best interests of local government reorganisation—that the present borough councillors will opt to serve on the new parish councils, simply because they are familiar with the geographical area of their own boroughs and not with the new district into which the borough might be incorporated. They might feel inclined to stay on their existing borough parish council as opposed to taking the bigger step—which is what one would hope they would want to take—of serving on the new district council. That is a blurring of choices which may not be in the best interests of reorganised local government.<br><br>
Another problem is finding what criteria, besides population, geographical areas and the proportion that they bear to new districts should be chosen, in the relatively short period available to bring the new parishes into existence, without drawing lines not acceptable to people on the wrong side of those lines. There is not the slightest doubt that whatever criteria we adopt in deciding whether a new parish is applicable, there will be people who will say that their area has only 500 people above that number, for instance, and it is therefore not satisfactory. It is difficult to find criteria which will be widely accepted as applicable to the dispossessed boroughs to decide which should be given the new parish status.<br><br>
The second range of questions which the Committee may wish to consider centres around the advisability of undertaking this exercise at all. What would be the benefits and disadvantages flowing from a decision of this sort? First, there is the valid argument that some functions will be exercised at the most local level, in other words, the parish level, <i>ab initio,</i> from 1st April, 1974. Parishes in these new dispossessed borough areas, if created, will be able to exercise some of the minor functions now in the hands of parishes, and this will benefit communities in dispossessed borough areas.<br><br>
In addition, one wants to preserve the historical identity of many of these communities wherever possible. I think that this change would help to preserve such community interests, and that is an argument on the other side of my more technical argument—that local govern-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 266</span>
ment reorganisation will be served better by allowing the new authorities proposed in the Bill to get off to an unimpeded start.<br><br>
The third possible argument is that to have parish councils at the dispossessed borough level might enable the borough dignities to be preserved at the parish level. This is important for boroughs which have a great sense of history and many historical associations and which feel that they would like to see their property and regalia preserved intact, in perpetuity, within an authority centred on their own geographical area. Some feel that this could be achieved by some of the Amendments.<br><br>
However, this course is fraught with difficulties, because it lays open to question the kind of incorporation one could find for the charters of dispossessed boroughs if they were incorporated in the new district charter. The communities might feel that the new charters would be a more total representation of the area's interests if they incorporated the old, rather than if the old charters had continued unimpeded in the parishes. My hon. Friend the Minister of State has dealt with the provisions about charters and it is not necessary for me to repeat earlier arguments. Under Clause 237(7) the existing charters, even if they are lapsed, are to be stored wherever possible in the communities to which they relate, although the charters themselves having lapsed, the significant features might be amalgamated in a new charter given to the new district.<br><br>
One Amendment deals with the possibility of bringing the situation applicable in England into line with that applicable in Wales. However, there are far fewer authorities in Wales, which makes the administrative job smaller. More important, the Bill deals with the division of local authorities in Wales into counties and districts, whereas in England the districts are to be dealt with by order in about a year's time. It is therefore impossible for the same timetable to operate for both areas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Thomas</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does this not make our case for a separate Bill for Welsh affairs, as the proposals are different structurally, as well as philosophically?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman knows as well as I do that the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0153">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 267</span>
Committee is fully able to consider the aspects of the Bill as it applies to England and Wales. He made that perfectly clear this morning by his most eloquent contribution, and the brief contribution of the hon. Member for Pontypridd (Mr. John), which might serve as a valuable example which other hon. Members opposite would do well to emulate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thomas</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was just a preliminary canter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One is not arguing about whether there should be any difference between Wales and England, but saying that it is not possible to bring the same pressure of implementation to bear, simply because for Wales the arrangements have gone further than they have in England.<br><br>
The Government realise that this matter is of the greatest interest to many people, and they would not want to give the impression of having reached firm conclusions in respect of the dispossessed boroughs. I have outlined the proposals in the Bill, but the Government are prepared to listen to today's debate, to consider the advice given by hon. Members with a view to reconsidering the position, and to returning on Report with what seems possible in the light of the major difficulties—I have outlined some of them—and in the light of the advice of hon. Members.<br><br>
The two blocks of Government Amendments should not cause the Committee any anxiety. They are tidying-up Amendments, but it might be appropriate to deal with them now.<br><br>
They are Nos. 146, 147, 150, 148 and 149. The purpose of Amendment No. 146, Amendment No. 147 and Amendment No. 150, which is consequential, is to provide for the transitional period for parishes which are being divided. The approach is similar to that for counties and districts. In other words, new areas are set up from the passing of the Bill, and these will run parallel to the existing areas which are retained until 1st April, 1974. In other words, there is a concurrence of operation of the two areas. The effect of the Amendment will be to remove the time element, enabling the two areas to continue concurrently.<br><br>
The effect of the second Amendment is to make it clear that Part IV of Schedule 1 applies only to parishes split between counties or metropolitan districts.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 268</span>
This raises the obvious question about the parishes that could be split between districts within a county as opposed to a metropolitan district. It will be necessary, under Clause 237, to introduce general provisions dealing with split parishes, should there be any such split parishes under the district organisation which will take place in a year's time.<br><br>
The second group of Amendments deals with the question of the rural boroughs. These rural boroughs, as has already been mentioned, are those which came into existence either under certain provisions of the 1933 Act, or the 1958 Act, when they were amalgamated with rural districts and retained a council termed a borough council, but with the powers of a parish council. The purpose of these Amendments is that the new council will be in the same form, with the same powers and the same area as the existing council. But an area will simply be transformed into a parish on 1st April. 1974.<br><br>
Under the Bill as drafted, the rural boroughs go out of existence and become parishes on 1st April, 1974. This is defective, in that in March, 1974, it is a statutory obligation for new parishes to have parish meetings, and if the parish meetings do not take place in March, 1974, there will be no way in which the new chairman of the parish meeting, who should take over in 1974, can be elected. It is therefore necessary for the rural boroughs to have two natures between now and their going out of existence in 1974, and this means that they will be parishes as from the passing of this Bill, which means that in March, 1974, they can have their meetings and elect their parish meeting chairman and continue as parishes, as from 1st April, 1974.<br><br>
5.15 p.m.<br><br>
As I have already said that we are prepared to review the entire case of rural boroughs hon. Members opposite may ask whether there is any necessity to tidy up legislation in that respect. I ask anyone who takes that view to accept my assurance that we shall re-examine the question of the small, dispossessed boroughs, within which category we have to consider the rural boroughs. However, at this stage of progress of the Bill it would be wrong to allow a patently defective subsection to go forward. For
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0154">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 269</span>
that reason, I ask that this group of Amendments, designed merely to remedy a defective piece of legislation, be allowed to go forward, despite the undertaking that I have given to re-examine the whole question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary has gone some way towards meeting the points of the Amendments, although not those of Amendment No. 15 or new Clause No. 1, which were the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell). Indeed, I suspect that if Amendment No. 15, which proposes deletion of subsections (6) to (8), were adopted, consequential Amendments would be necessary to take account of the points which the Government themselves are putting forward in the Amendments to which the Under-Secretary has just referred. However, I imagine that he would find ways of dealing with that point along the lines that he referred to concerning the dispossessed boroughs.<br><br>
In referring to dispossessd boroughs the hon. Gentleman was presumably including both boroughs and urban districts. After all, there are certain free-standing urban districts to which the arguments applied to dispossessed boroughs would also apply.<br><br>
In the two groups of Amendments which we are considering together there are two different sets of arguments. The first, to which the Parliamentary Secretary has given an adequate answer, relates to dispossessed boroughs and urban districts. The second concerns the arguments for community councils of a much more general nature, as outlined by my hon. Friend the Member for Small Heath. My right hon. and hon. Friends and I believe that all parts of the country should have community councils, and that they should not merely be a luxury afforded to dispossessed boroughs and urban districts as a consolation prize for not being a district in the new authorities. In our opinion, community councils should exist not only throughout the rural areas and rural boroughs but also in the metropolitan areas.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary referred to the distinction between the Welsh and English provisions. He pointed out that we should not reach the stage of electing, for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 270</span>
example, district councils in England until later, since the boundaries will not be drawn. In fact, no elections will take place until November 1973, with the resultant difficulties of trying to crowd in the formation of parishes. I hope that that argument will not prevent the Government from considering very seriously the arguments which they have already agreed to consider in relation not only to the dispossessed authorities but also the more general case for community councils, which I shall now seek to develop.<br><br>
Amendment No. 15 and new Clause 1, and the series of consequential Amendments which would be necessary with respect to a number of Clauses—I consulted the Public Bill Office on that question and was assured that they could be tabled later if the Amendment were adopted—attempt to extend to England the provisions for community councils as outlined in the Redcliffe-Maud Report. Those provisions were supported by the White Paper on Local Government Reform of February 1970, and have already been accepted by the Government as being appropriate for Wales, as illustrated by Clause 29 onward.<br><br>
I gather that the Minister of State is not altogether unsympathetic to the idea of urban parishes. Indeed, his recent speech to the Association of Municipal Councils, as reported in the Press, suggests that he has some sympathy for the idea of urban parishes. Whether that is purely for the dispossessed authorities or on a more general scale is not yet clear.<br><br>
I want to clarify certain misapprehensions about the idea of community councils before discussing some of the reasons why I believe that these are an essential part of any local government reform, and why they should be included in the Bill. It is not surprising that there is opposition to the idea of community councils from local government associations. The A.M.C. and, to some extent, the County Council Association, seem to frown upon community associations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Arthur Blenkinsop</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The A.M.C. did put before Redcliffe-Maud something very much along these lines.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was going to refer to the proposals which the A.M.C. put before the Redcliffe-Maud Committee—but does not my hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Mr. Blenkinsop) agree that the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0155">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 271</span>
existing local government associations may have a bias against community councils. Existing authorities and principal authorities and districts under the new system of local government may feel that community councils could be a nuisance. I believe that democracy is about people being an effective nuisance. It deals with the sort of problems which my hon. Friend the Member for Small Heath said that people found at local level, and that if there was in existence some effective form of community council people could be an effective form of community council people could be an effective nuisance to some of the very large new authorities being created by the Bill.<br><br>
If we do not take advantage of this opportunity to make provision for community councils covering the whole of the country there will be permanent pressures from the existing authorities, once they have been set up, not to permit community councils to be set up. They will be afraid that these bodies will be a nuisance. In democracies we often have nuisances. The value of democracy is that we can from time to time be nuisances. I hope that we will not complete the passage of this important Bill without proper provision to deal with community councils or urban parishes. The 1971 reform would be wasted if it did not include proper provision for this matter.<br><br>
One of the most interesting parts of the research carried out for the Redcliffe-Maud Committee, reported in the research appendices of Volume 3 of its Report, was a study of the activities of existing parish councils. The study shows that the most active parish councils are those on the periphery and not deep in the rural areas. They are the ones which are beginning to deal with the sort of problems which my hon. Friend the Member for Small Heath referred to. They are able to act for their communities in the areas surrounding our big cities and towns.<br><br>
The Government have suggested that in the urban areas voluntary bodies might fulfil the functions which we suggest should be carried out by community councils. I do not think that would be altogether satisfactory. Although voluntary bodies carry out much useful work they cannot be effective and representative, and do not cover the whole com-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 272</span>
munity in the same way as a body which is elected by the community. They are often controlled by a small, well-meaning section of the community, but they do not have the breadth of coverage which elected bodies on a community council basis would have. I hope that the Government will not produce the answer that voluntary bodies will be able to take the place of community councils.<br><br>
I return to the argument for community councils put forward in the Redcliffe-Maud Report. On the need for local councils the Report says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Meanwhile we had become increasingly convinced by those who emphasised the need for an organ of community at grass-roots level. Our conclusion was that any new pattern of democratic government must include elected local councils, not to provide main services, but to promote and watch over the particular interests of communities in city, town and village throughout England."</p></blockquote>
The Report goes on to recommend that:
<br><blockquote><p>"local councils should be elected to represent and communicate the wishes of cities, towns and villages in all matters of special concern to the inhabitants. These local councils would, at the outset, succeed the existing county borough, borough urban district and parish councils, though provision should be made for later adjustment of their areas.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>"The only duty of the local council would be to represent local opinion, but it would have the right to be consulted on matters of special interest to its inhabitants and it would have the power to do for the local community a number of things best done locally."</p></blockquote>
The Commission concludes:
<br><blockquote><p>"Within the wider framework of the main authority, local councils can put fresh life into the rural parish and give communities in cities and towns new kinds of opportunity to speak and take action for themselves."</p></blockquote>
There was one respect in which the Redcliffe-Maud Committee did not go far enough, because it was not sure whether there should be community or local councils of this sort in the metropolitan areas. Mr. Senior, in his dissenting memorandum, came back to the need for community councils in metropolitan areas. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"My colleagues emphasise the comparative importance of the 'local' council's proper functions, but their own attitude to the situation in their two-level 'metropolitan' give these protestations a hollow ring. In these areas, they say, there will not be the same need—indeed, there will be no great wish—for 'local' councils. But why ever not? Why should Little Lever let itself be silenced?"</p></blockquote>
I read these words with considerable emotion because Little Lever is part of my constituency.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0156">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 273</span>
Mr. Senior continued:
<br><blockquote><p>"In respect of population size, of need for community representation, of scope for the use of powers to provide amenities, conveniences and facilities for the benefits of the local inhabitants, and even of the capacity of existing authorities to 'play a part' in the running of statutory services, there is absolutely no difference whatever between my colleagues' unitary areas and their metropolitan districts."</p></blockquote>
I think that Mr. Senior was absolutely right. As I pointed out in the Second Reading debate, in the new metropolitan districts—in Greater Manchester, Mersey-side, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire—a number of existing urban districts are unlikely to form even a ward in the new authorities. The new authorities may have a population of 2½ million, with 60-70 members and 20-25 wards. The quota for a ward may well be 11,000-12,000 people.<br><br>
In Greater Manchester many urban districts do not have a population of 11,000 and will therefore not make up a ward within these metropolitan districts. I hope that they will be considered. They provide the argument for community councils not only for these so-called freestanding dispossessed authorities but also for urban areas, including those in the great conurbations.<br><br>
5.30 p.m.<br><br>
It is sometimes argued that the case for community councils is to provide a sop to councillors who will lose their office, chains and ermine as a result of the Bill. I do not see community councils as a sop to councillors. They should not be seen as a sop to vested interests, or to the dignity of existing councillors; nor should they be seen as small local authorities carrying out certain management functions which larger authorities do not wish to undertake. It seems to me that their job is not to provide main services but to preserve and watch over the interests of their communities. I do not see any validity in the argument that has sometimes been put forward that the creation of such community councils would be divisive to the new authorities. If they were properly representing the interests of their own communities they would be helping to ensure that the new local government areas knitted together in an adequate way.<br><br>
I want to cover two more points—first, the question of the functions of these
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 274</span>
bodies and, secondly, the ways in which they could be defined. That question was raised by the Under-Secretary, who discussed the difficulties of defining such community councils, particularly in the built-in urban areas.<br><br>
Although we live in what is sometimes called a mobile community, with people moving from area to area rather more frequently than they once did, most residents of an area have some interest in its activities. Parents send their children to a local school and, as my hon. Friend said, they have an interest in the development of that school. There are questions of shopping, bus time-tables, and other functions affecting their own locality, in which people want to have a say, and be able to do something about. These things can not be dealt with by the new principal authorities. They could be dealt with by a community council along the lines which we have described.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend pointed out, such community councils would be of advantage in carrying out the work proposed in the Skeffington Committee's Report—of ensuring the existence of community forums in which planning changes could be discussed. Therefore, we ought to try to ensure that community councils can be introduced at the same time as the new authorities come into existence.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary referred to the power that exists under Clause 50(7), whereby subsequent reviews can be made by counties enabling them to set up community councils, or parish councils, as they are termed in the English part of the Bill. But I do not believe that the new authorities would do that. I believe that it is our job to put this into the structure of the Bill, in order to ensure that such community councils are set up.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Mr. Blenkinsop) pointed out, one of the best descriptions of the philosophy behind community councils of this kind was the A.M.C. evidence to the Redcliffe-Maud Committee, in which the Association called for community trusts as largely consultative and representative bodies. Their model was similar to the one drawn upon by Mr. Senior in his dissenting memorandum, to which I have referred. In each case statutory machinery would provide parish councils throughout the whole of the country. They would not be a third arm or any agency of local government; they would be local demo-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0157">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 275</span>
cratic bodies, with the means to represent any local point of view to anybody, and with a statutory right to be consulted.<br><br>
Finally, I come to the question of defining urban parishes or communities as we would see them. The most difficult aspect of defining these urban areas is that unlike a rural village they do not have precise limits. One can see relatively easily where rural parishes should be divided, but it is more difficult to see where one would divide urban parishes. Perhaps ward boundaries are sometimes a first approximation, although on occasions these have been adjusted to retain equality of population between different parts of the town, and therefore do not really represent the boundaries between different communities within a town. The factors which the Boundary Commission, or whoever was defining comunities, would need to bear in mind in drawing these boundaries would include the local shopping centre—often the focal point of a community or a neighbourhood—the local primary school, which is another focus of activity in the community, the churches, the amenity groups which exist in some towns and cities.<br><br>
There are considerable problems in defining boundaries, but we have had some experience. The Association for Neighbourhood Councils has defined communities within the Greater London Borough of Haringey. In the County Borough of Stockport a group has prepared a set of boundaries, and other attempts have been made to lay down boundaries, showing that it is not as difficult a job as has been suggested to draw up boundaries for viable communities within our urban areas.<br><br>
Amendment No. 15 transfers the powers from Clause 21 in the Welsh part of the Bill, making the appropriate changes, and new Clause 1 transfers these powers from Clause 29 in the Welsh part of the Bill, giving the Minister powers to divide urban areas into communities. These are valuable powers, to ensure that community councils—the name is not important—are effective bodies at a local level in our communities in the future.<br><br>
The Minister has said that he will consider favourably the question of the dispossessed authorities. I hope that he will look again at the more general case for community councils, and perhaps bring forward proposals on Report.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Arthur Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have followed the speech of the hon. Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper) with considerable interest. He has directed his advocacy to the creation of community councils. I am very sympathetic to that idea, and I share his difficulty in knowing what criteria to bring to the suggestion of that type of authority to enable some progress to be made. The Bill would not seem to be the proper vehicle by which this can be done. Far more research is required into the question of community councils, and I do not know whether it is possible or suitable for us to try to define the criteria upon which community councils could be developed. I support my hon. Friend's advocacy on their behalf, but at the same time I find myself in a difficulty, as I have tried to explain.<br><br>
My purpose is to deal with the gap in which many of the existing authorities will find themselves after the new councils come into operation on 1st April, 1974. At that date we shall be faced with the disappearance of all local authorities, with the exception of parish councils, the Greater London boroughs and the Isles of Scilly. I want to concentrate my argument on the terms of Amendment No. 88, standing in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Abingdon (Mr. Neave) and myself, which purports to deal with the position of many authorities which will disappear from the local government scene under the terms of the Bill. Counties, county boroughs, municipal boroughs, urban and rural district councils are all to disappear, and among the non-county boroughs which will cease to exist there are a number of small bodies which have had corporations and charters for many centuries, and which have a variety of purely local functions that should be maintained at a local level rather than be transferred to the new districts in which older towns will find themselves. These communities will, and should be, ensured means by which they can retain their identity, their loyalties in community terms and their established interests and institutions.<br><br>
The civic importance of this question has already been mentioned, and the centuries, in some cases, of corporate identity. These towns and many of the smaller urban districts have also their own purely local parks, swimming baths and things of that kind, which in a rural parish are, and will remain, the responsibility of

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 277</span>
the parish council. I am thinking in terms of charities and endowments. Are we thinking, in terms of a transitional stage, that there should be a necessity to transfer these endowments and ownerships to a district council with an idea of bringing them back into a parish council subsequently?<br><br>
What we see is a certain blank spot, a certain void in the Government's thinking. I am pleased to have the assurances from my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, but during Second Reading, and in the course of correspondence, we have been asked to await the implementation of the Bill with effect from 1st April, 1974, and leave some years to elapse before parishes can be re-established, I refer particularly to the re-establishment of municipal boroughs and the urban and rural district council upon which the emphasis of my emarks is based.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heseltine</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is perfectly correct in saying that in the Second Reading debate this was the position, but perhaps I could clarify the matter. I intervened earlier to say that we are now reconsidering this position in the light of what has been said to us. So the position has changed since the Second Reading debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take that assurance, but I feel that the Government are putting great pressure on local authorities up and down the country, and with respect, they should have recognised sooner that this question could not be left open. We could not create the void with which we are faced under the terms of this Bill. I welcome what the Under-Secretary has said, but I had hoped that in the Second Reading we should have had a more realistic attitude to the problem with which we shall be faced unless we have subsequent Amendments.<br><br>
It would be more convenient to think in terms of some procedure whereby new parish councils can be brought into existence and can become immediately successor authorities, taking over the existing responsibilities not only of the parish councils which remain, but in terms of the small, free-standing municipal and urban areas. This group of Amendments seeks to place the councils of the smaller non-county boroughs and urban districts in England in a similar position to that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 278</span>
of the councils of boroughs and urban districts in Wales.<br><br>
I realise there are difficulties of definition in relation to this. I have already mentioned free-standing areas, and I take the Under-Secretary's point; one does not want to have, within a district council, competing local authorities. So that in an endeavour to be definitive I said that should it be free-standing towns of a population of, say, 20,000. I think we want to see that these authorities are to some extent in isolation; otherwise there will be the competition which I suggest we should try to avoid. There needs to be a unity within the compass of the proposed parish councils in these areas, and an historic identity as well.<br><br>
There is a great degree of sentiment in local government and I am sure this is recognised by Members on both sides of the Committee, although I am not sure that some of my colleagues in the Government do to the extent that I would wish. They were teased earlier by an hon. Gentleman opposite who said that none of them served in local government. Many of us who have done so recognise the sentiment which exists among local communities about their authorities.<br><br>
5.45 p.m.<br><br>
[Mr. ALAN FITCH in the Chair]<br><br>
There are the substantial boroughs which, in the main and in the outcome, will form the centre of the new district councils. It is not that type of borough or urban district authority that I am thinking about. These will be perfectly capable of being the successors to the unified local authorities in the district council for which an urban area of that character will act as a focal point. There is a wide range of boroughs and urban districts—I am told something like 171 free-standing boroughs and urban districts—with fewer than 20,000 inhabitants. That is the type of authority for which I seek parish council status, and I also add, in the terms of the Amendment, that they should be termed town councils rather than parishes. I think that this is better nomenclature. These will not find themselves becoming a nucleus of a new district council but will be something apart. The status of a parish or town-council will ensure the preservation of their identity. It is this second group that I am particularly concerned to advocate in my Amendment.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0159">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 279</span>
What we must do is to ensure continuity in local government wherever this is possible. There is much to be said for doing it with effect from 1st April, 1974, rather than having the gap with which we are faced in the terms of the Bill. I am glad to hear the favourable noises of my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, and I look forward to seeing the terms of an Amendment which, presumably, we shall put down on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blenkinsop</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the general tone of the Under-Secretary's early comments, since they gave us some encouragement that this whole field was being looked at again by the Government and that they were not standing rigidly by the provisions laid down in the Bill. I only wish they were as flexible with regard to my earlier Amendment and as they may prove to be with regard to these.<br><br>
I also express my personal protest that the Sittings of this Committee prevent one from taking part in the important debate taking place in the Chamber at the present time which, to some of us, is a serious matter. Having made that protest, this whole field of the possible development of neighbourhood or community is one in which I have had much interest for some considerable time. Together with Michael Young and others, we helped to co-sponsor the Association for Neighbourhood Councils to try to obtain wider discussion of this possibility. Therefore, I am not only interested in the first group of Amendments relating to continuity for certain free-standing boroughs that have been discussed but also in the wider and exciting question of the possibility of introducing a new level of representation and grass roots expression which is of serious importance.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary referred to the first group of Amendments in some detail, and, like the Secretary of State when speaking in the House during Second Reading, expressed the point of view that there might be some value in a break of continuity. I understand the argument that was made on this question, although I do not myself accept it. I think that, on balance, that benefit will arise from continuity, and I hope therefore that the pressure being exerted, and the comments that are being made, will be taken account of, so that a means may be found of achieving continuity for the free-standing
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 280</span>
boroughs, and the continuance of certain rights which they have always enjoyed.<br><br>
I personally have no strong feelings about which of the alternatives that have appeared on the Order Paper should be accepted. I would say only that there are some slightly unsatisfactory factors in relation to Amendment No. 88, to which the hon. Gentleman has just referred, which I believe has the support of the A.M.C. That Amendment makes a specific provision of a population figure, which always creates certain problems, and inserts a certain undesirable rigidity. Thus, I should have thought that Amendment No. 15, in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper) and others, or Amendment No. 26, standing in my own name, might have proved more valuable. However, as I have said, I hold no strong views on that point. I imagine that the Under-Secretary, when he further considers this matter, will at some point express a view concerning the helpfulness, or otherwise, of the inclusion of a population figure. Personally, I rather regret it.<br><br>
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Farnworth, I am very much concerned that this interesting proposal of extending the area of the urban parish should be considered at this moment of time, and not be left for some future date. I for one am concerned at the amount of cynicism concerning the whole question of local government representation. Here is a means by which we can introduce the idea of new opportunities for involvement of one kind or another. I know that "involvement" has become an "in" word, and is therefore suspect, but any other word conveying the same meaning will do as well.<br><br>
I believe that this rather informal type of authority, at a very local level, presents a very good opportunity for drawing into activity a large number of people, both young and old, who have hitherto been unwilling to take part in the more official, grandiose types of authority, both local and national, which exist at present. One can see something of this from the support given to the growing number of informal <i>ad hoc</i> bodies that are set up. It appears that nearly all these are voluntary organisations set up very largely from the stimulus of professional and semi-professional middle-class people, and they seem to be sectionalised in this way. The people who organised the campaign
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0160">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 281</span>
against the third London airport at Stansted, for example, clearly knew how to exert their influence in the most effective way.<br><br>
But we are concerned with a much wider range of people. A heartening fact is that recently there have been examples of <i>ad hoc</i> bodies being formed on a very local basis, touching a much wider range of people, and encouraging young people to take part. This is of great importance. I see no reason why we should not make a start to open the door for the possibility of this kind of local neighbourhood council to be established in the larger towns where there is a desire for it to be done. I would not wish to impose this where there is no sign of eagerness for it, but I would be happy to see it develop and prove a success. I would like the opportunity to be taken, through this Bill, of enabling quite a wide range of experiments to take place from which we would be able perhaps to judge rather more fully the final form. I see no reason why this should not happen if the provisions of the Amendment which my hon. Friend the Member for Farnworth and I are proposing, and of the first new Clause, are adopted. We are using the ideas shown to be acceptable to the Government having regard to Wales.<br><br>
As I see it, this would not require neighbourhood councils to be established everywhere. It would allow a certain amount of latitude. If that were not so, I would be willing to consider some further Amendment to ensure this. But I think it is right that this possibility should be available.<br><br>
I was interested to learn that the Association of Neighbourhood Councils has undertaken studies of reactions of people in a wide range of large and small towns, and great interest has been shown in these studies. They held a conference in London at which a great deal of interest was shown by a large number of voluntary bodies as well as statutory bodies and those associated with local activities at parish and ward level. This is an indication that there is a demand for action of this sort.<br><br>
Unlike the Secretary of State, I believe that there needs to be some form of elected body that will not take the place of voluntary organisations. Indeed, I hope that it would stimulate the formulation of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 282</span>
more voluntary bodies. It is rather hard to conceive of more, but there is no reason that one should take the place of the other.<br><br>
6.0 p.m.<br><br>
An elected body would give an opportunity for a wider range of people entering into the activities in the voluntary organisations. It would be of immense value to have the statutory framework to enable secretarial help to be available, and would enable advice to be given as to how voluntary organisations might set about their campaign and also to provide premises. This is the type of democratic action which we should encourage, and I hope that it will be possible through the Committee to give encouragement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Daniel Awdry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I feel very strongly that we must try to preserve local councils for the small boroughs. My own constituency almost certainly forms a new district, and there are three small boroughs at present within that district. Having received representations from all three, I am naturally dismayed that with effect from 1st April, 1974, their councils will totally disappear and it irritates my constituents very much that all the parish councils in the surrounding area will be preserved. I ask the Committee to consider who, under the proposals of the Bill, will represent local feeling and attitudes in these small boroughs. As far as I can see, there will be pressure groups of one kind or another—chambers of commerce, trades councils and action groups—and I think that this is not the most healthy way of reflecting local attitudes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ted Leadbitter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member for Chippenham (Mr. Awdry) will explain why they would not be helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Awdry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not saying that pressure groups are unhelpful, but to represent the views and attitudes of a local area some form of elected council is a better forum than a pressure group. I agree that we must have pressure groups—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Member saying that he does not object to the organisations he mentioned pressing upon a community council in order that the full extent of local opinion can be heard
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0161">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 283</span>
and examined? To that extent I have no objection, but if he meant what I thought he meant, then he raised a serious matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Awdry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am saying that it would be far better if in these small boroughs, local attitudes and views could be represented by an elected council. Under the provision of the Bill there will be no such council on 1st April, 1974 and I think this is a very serious matter with which the Government should deal.<br><br>
In his very helpful statement the Minister said that there were some difficulties which he asked us to face. I do face them. He asked us to face the question of the district where the borough is large and dominates. I imagine that he is thinking of an area like Avon, with Bristol completely dominating, and where the borough is very large and the rest of the district is very small. He asks where we draw the line.<br><br>
I accept that that is a problem, but I agree with the hon. Member for South Shields (Mr. Blenkinsop) that it is difficult to set a figure. Nevertheless I do not see how we can get away from that. I should have thought that the figure of 20,000 or 25,000 must be about right. We have all received the circular from the Town Clerk of Abingdon, and it is interesting from that to see that when a referendum was circulated to the boroughs with 25,000 people or less, 90 per cent. of those boroughs were in favour of some form of local council, whereas we find that most towns with a population of between 25,000 and 40,000 were not in favour. This is what I rather expected.<br><br>
With a town of 25,000 or more, that town already has a very considerable interest within the district, and we are here talking about the small boroughs. I go along with the spirit behind Amendment No. 88 which draws the line at 20,000, saying that boroughs with a population of 20,000 or less should be entitled to some form of local council.<br><br>
That would be my answer to the Minister's first two objections. The third was an interesting one. He said that he was a little concerned that if we have a form of community council, the existing borough councillors will be dissuaded, from going on to the district council and will prefer to go and serve on the local council. I see that point, but I am bound to say that it does not conform with my
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 284</span>
experience. I know of many councillors who are looking forward to taking part in a wider sphere in the district, but nevertheless intend to go on serving on the local level. They feel that they can do both jobs usefully and well. I believe that that would be the experience of most of us. I do not think that the Minister's third argument was a very strong one.<br><br>
Therefore, I urge him to have no gap. If we have a gap and the local councils do not come into force on 1st April, 1974, it will be very difficult indeed to get them going again. Continuity is vital.<br><br>
Finally, I do not think that we can talk of parish councils. I know that the name is not absolutely vital and that one can make too much of this, but I think it is a little inappropriate. It is asking rather a lot for a town of 15,000 or 20,000 people, which has a long history and where people have served for many years on the town council, to say that as from 1st April, 1974, they are all parish councillors. I think that would hurt their feelings, and we must consider that. I would therefore suggest "town council" as a reasonable name.<br><br>
For all these reasons—and there may be many others that I have not mentioned—I feel very strongly indeed that on 1st April, 1974 we must produce councils of some kind for these small boroughs and call them town councils.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cocks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was interested that the hon. Member for Chippenham (Mr. Awdry), who in no sense can be called an interested party in Avon, pointed out how Bristol will dominate that area. This to some extent reflects fears in the area surrounding Bristol, and I hope that perhaps I may call him in aid should I move an Amendment at a later stage to remedy the situation.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Northants, South (Mr. Arthur Jones) said that the Bill was not the vehicle for doing something about this. I am not at all impressed with that argument. It was put forward during proceedings on the Local Government (Qualification of Councillors) Bill for doing nothing about certain exemptions which there take place. It was said that it must await the reorganisation of local government. Yet in this Bill, despite its enormous size, the Government have not touched this problem about which sympa-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0162">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 285</span>
thetic noises were made during proceedings on that lesser Bill.<br><br>
The Minister referred to the blurring of choices as to which authority one should serve on. The hon. Member for Chippenham has just mentioned that himself. If the Minister is genuinely concerned about this, I hope that he will make quite sure, when we come to discuss the question of allowances, conditions of service, and so on, that any representations we make about this are fully considered, so that the choice is a completely free one and is not hampered at all by anything which may weigh against particular sections of the community.<br><br>
With reference to community councils, there is a tendency in all measures of reorganisation now to think that bigger is necessarily better. We had this on the question of Health Service reorganisation, and I think that there is some thinking of that kind behind the present Bill. This is probably due to the question of management studies, efficient use of resources, and so on. We thus have the constant difficulty of trying to reconcile great size with what my hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Mr. Blenkinsop) called the grass roots, or local participation or involvement.<br><br>
I should like to take a rather broader view of community councils than has been taken so far, because in this series of Amendments and in the new Clause the composition is not in fact defined. Since the Minister was kind enough to say that he was hopeful that suggestions would be forthcoming from the Committee, I should like to say that what we really require is the setting up of some kind of machinery whereby everybody who is eligible to vote in the area is entitled to attend.<br><br>
It may be said that this would be completely unwieldy, but I remind the Committee that some very large companies in this country have hundreds of thousands of shareholders, and yet they can quite comfortably hold their annual meetings in halls which will take only 300 or 400. To my mind this would be an organic solution, as opposed to the more mechanistic solution of setting up another body with elected representatives, and the hierarchical structure which this would impose, and also the separating off from the elected representatives of all the vast
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 286</span>
majority of people who are electors.<br><br>
When the Ports Bill was under consideration last year, we called a town meeting in Bristol, which some 700 people attended to discuss what was then an important conservation issue. Machinery like this, where those who are involved in a particular issue could attend, would fulfil a very real need. The issues which would draw attendances would obviously vary. In my own constituency we had some flooding recently. I held an <i>ad hoc</i> meeting of those residents affected. It was an emergency situation, where people wanted to come along and have their say, although many of them had not been to a meeting for years, and might not attend another for years to come. If this could have been done by some kind of community council, it would have filled a need.<br><br>
A question arose on whether to have two single-sex schools, or whether they should be mixed. There is a feeling amongst those sending their children to these schools that a mistake has been made, and that the schools should be mixed, but if representations are made to the existing town council, they are made to the establishment which is associated with the previous decision, and which will lose face if it is changed. There should be some machinery or some body to take in those views and submit representations.<br><br>
A community council could also have offices and servicing, and be the recipient of all planning decisions and notices of development proposals for the area, so that these could be examined, and the rights of people protected. During the passage of the recent town planning consolidation legislation, I pointed out that the existing conditions for notice of development are grossly inadequate. My point was taken, but that Bill was not the place in which to do anything about it. Some body to watch over the interests of the community would make sure that rights were not eroded by default. We have to get away from the idea that certain elected representatives can always reflect situations which arise at a very local level, and the advantage of some such solution would be that in changing situations, different personnel would be involved and different interests and areas would be represented. Not only could the once-and-for-all problems be covered, but also the problems of long standing, such as pressure for a hospital, which in my
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0163">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 287</span>
own area has been kept up since 1936, and which could be looked after by a subgroup or sub-committee keeping up a running fight.<br><br>
We should not be looking for a further fixed, rigid structure, which will tend to attract mechanistically-minded people, but rather some kind of organic structure, able to change and reflect conditions which may vary from one area to another, and from one time to another. A community council along these lines would go a long way towards filling the gap which now exists so often between elected representatives and those whom they represent.</span></p>
<p>6.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patrick Cormack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful for my hon. Friend's assurances that he would look again at the dispossessed boroughs, but I am not entirely comforted. He displayed a fair amount of understanding, but it seemed to be coupled rather more with the zeal of the reformer than the concern of the guardian. I should like some of that concern to come to the fore.<br><br>
I should like to refer to Amendment No. 224, suggested by hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, South (Mr. Evelyn King) and myself. In a sense, it carries forward the arguments advanced by my hon. Friend the Member for North-ants, South (Mr. Arthur Jones), although we diverge from them in certain particulars. We tabled the Amendment because we were concerned that nothing be done to sacrifice something of worth and to destroy something which is the cause of much proper local pride, and all in the cause of tidiness and efficiency. There is a great value in local pride and tradition, and the customs by which they are often expressed, and one of the country's strengths is the strong sense of identity felt and expressed by many local communities.<br><br>
In the debate on the Gracious Speech my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives (Mr. Nott), in a moving passage, talked about the real poor of the twentieth century being those without roots. That was immediately taken up and echoed in all parts of the House. In many of our smaller and more ancient boroughs we find a real richness, most movingly obvious on occasions of civic dignity, when the community comes together to recognise and to demonstrate its sense of history.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 288</span>
As the Bill is now drafted, most of these small and ancient boroughs are under sentence of death. Some, I know, could conceivably be the centres of the new districts, and to some extent their traditions will continue. However, by a thoughtless and unfeeling disregard for the little and the local, we are proposing to rob civic life of much of its richness and diversity.<br><br>
There is great anxiety on this score. I have heard it throughout the House from many hon. Members who are not privileged to sit on the Committee, if it is a privilege. My hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke (Mr. Nicholas Edwards) was particularly concerned that I should mention his local case, the town of Newport, whose dignities were properly safeguarded in an Act of 1883. I understand from another hon. Member, who sits on the Committee, another Welshman, my hon. Friend the Member for Conway (Mr. Wyn Roberts), that the new County of Gwynedd will include Conway, with a charter going back to 1284, and a mayor who is also Constable of the Castle. What a shame that Conway's identity should be sacrificed!<br><br>
I refer particularly to my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. More). Ludlow contains four of the rural boroughs to which reference has been made several times during the course of today's debate, and they offer a good illustration and a good guide to a sensible solution to the problem, the kind of solution which my hon. Friend and I have proposed in our Amendment. Ludlow contains four of these rural boroughs: Bridgnorth, Much Wenlock, Bishop's Castle and Ludlow itself. They were preserved in 1958, and although they lost a great deal of their powers, they lost little of their civic dignity. I should like to quote from a letter which my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow sent to me when he was urging me to speak on their behalf in Committee. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Notwithstanding their demotion to the status of 'rural borough' under the 1958 Act, the Shropshire boroughs have maintained in a high degree their dignity, their civic sense, their consciousness of responsibility and the loyalty of their citizens. In Ludlow the Mayor still goes to church every Sunday in State with maces, etc., and the Member of Parliament is sometimes prayed for by name (and how he needs it)."</p></blockquote>
What harm is there in maintaining and extending that genuine sense of local pride
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0164">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 289</span>
and continuity?<br><br>
That is the intention of our Amendment. We suggest that those boroughs which have charters going back before 1700 should, regardless of their size, be allowed—not forced—to take the style and dignity of ancient borough, in the same way as rural boroughs were allowed to take the style and dignity of rural borough in 1958. Also, the chief citizen of those towns should not be demoted to chairman of the parish council, but allowed to keep the title, "mayor".<br><br>
The Minister may argue—I am sure that others will—that this would be a divisive factor within the new districts. I hope that I may carry hon. Members on both sides of the Committee when I suggest that it would be much more divisive, as well as more damaging to the new districts, to trample on ancient privileges and local feeling. I appeal to both my hon. Friends, who after all are Ministers in the Department of the Environment. That Department, set up last year as a brave and adventurous step in government, has shown that it has a true and proper concern for conserving the beauties of the countryside and our ancient towns and villages. If those towns and villages, and particularly the boroughs to which we are now referring, are to be maintained as more than delightful tourist attractions and to have the very spirit and breath of life in them, my hon. Friends would be performing a signal service by accepting the Amendment or, at any rate, accepting its spirit and later tabling a better drafted Amendment.<br><br>
My hon. Friends earlier today displayed some sensitivity. I do not expect them to give a definite answer tonight. However, I urge them seriously to examine this question. To do so would not be to make a great concession, or be destructive of the aims of the Bill. On the contrary, it might well prove a unifying and cohesive factor in the new districts. I shall find it hard to support the Government, on Report and beyond, unless they have gone a long way towards making some concession in this regard.<br><br>
In conclusion, I shall quote from two of the charters of Ludlow. The first, by happy accident, was issued on 7th December, 1461, 510 years ago today. It is stated that
<br><blockquote><p>"the same town shall be a free borough for ever,"</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 290</span>
I would remind my hon. Friends of the words "for ever". One hundred and forty five years later, James I, who was fond of issuing charters, issued Ludlow with a further charter. The same words occur:
<br><blockquote><p>"that the same should be then and from thence a free borough for ever,"</p></blockquote>
I ask my hon. Friends not to take to themselves such supreme powers that they deal to Ludlow and similar boroughs throughout the country a death blow which is in direct opposition to the spirit of the charters which they are proud to possess, and which in many cases were issued many centuries earlier.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack) said that he did not expect the Minister to give a definite answer tonight: I should be satisfied with an answer.<br><br>
The problem with the Bill as discussed so far—and we have not proceeded very far during five Sittings—is that at one end of the local government scale we have nothing promised while at the other end sufficient confusion exists to draw support for Amendments from the Government side for the first time. Indeed, the hon. Member for Cannock indicated the stern action that he is prepared to take on Report and beyond. Those of us who have tabled Amendments supporting community councils will live in hope that we may be sustained by the hon. Member for Cannock, and his hon. Friend the Member for Chippenham (Mr. Awdry). I know at the hon. Member for Chippenham is a man of his word. During the proceedings of the Transport Bill he frequently agreed with me that his word was as good as his bond. Thus, two hon. Members opposite are already in the bag, although no doubt the Minister will work upon them, and our hopes may well become confused, matching our confusion about the two poles—the provincial end and the community end—of the Government's local government reorganisation proposals.<br><br>
I envisage a community council as being one which crystallises in protest, in agitation and in consultation issues affecting the community's social life and environmental conditions. Having done so, it can present a challenge to the major decision-making authorities.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0165">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 291</span>
I do not envisage a community council as virtually innocuous, which is weak, with no powers. I do not envisage a community council as bereft of the challenge of trades councils and other pressure groups. The essence of democracy is strongly to express views on those subjects that matter to the community. One of the great dangers today and one of the reasons why we must have a rational reorganisation of local government is that there is an excessive amount of authority, which has a dampening effect upon individual expression. Professionalism in local government is dominating lay representation.<br><br>
Those of us who have consistently argued the unitary principle and the case for provincial councils recognise that the size of local government makes it imperative that we have strength in communities. A local monthly parish meeting would be no good for it would not be worth an argument. Such an arrangement would be a withering away of the influence of neighbourhood expression.<br><br>
I attach more importance to community councils than to provincial councils. Provincial councils would deal with overall strategy, leaving structural planning to be dealt with by the counties, the metropolitan counties and the districts. There are all sorts of ways of dealing with questions of strategy, but we can find no alternatives to community councils to provide a neighbourhood with the right to challenge the decision-makers in local government.<br><br>
Neighbourhood or community councils should have functions, not statutory powers, which are entirely different. We have agreed in principle that social services, the establishment of a good educational system, a good housing programme and all those services which are concerned with communications and the general improvement of the infrastructure should be applied by statutory powers in authorities large enough to provide the economic scale to operate them efficiently. But a community council must have functions, some of which will come to mind if I refer to the three main processes of making their opinions known—protest, agitation, and consultation.<br><br>
6.30 p.m.<br><br>
Often under the present structure, and inescapably in future, a local authority, because of human weaknesses and the imperfections of human judgments, may
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 292</span>
make decisions harmful to individuals or local groups within an area. I served on a local authority for a number of years. It is an advantage to have local government experience and I commend it to all hon. Members. In planning, for instance, a local authority may make dreadful mistakes. A businessman may apply for a small change of use in a property next door to a dwelling house, for instance. Before the person in the dwelling house can say "Jack Robinson", there is machinery working at all hours of the day—a launderette or some other noise nuisances.<br><br>
This is an important example of when an individual should have the right to protest at the right time. No one denies that the right of protest exists, but it should exist at the right time. A community council, having complete surveillance over a metropolitan district's or county council's proposals, may be able to anticipate situations. There is nothing better than protest to help to change men's minds. Parliament often finds that. Public opinion or a national lobby often sways Governments. Let us not underestimate the effect of a community council making known its views by protesting to a decision-making local authority.<br><br>
A community council could do many things to improve general amenities. It could make representations to decisionmaking bodies about the nature of amenities required.<br><br>
There would not be only a large authority at a distance proposing to site playgrounds for children next to old people's homes. It is surprising how often that happens. In my own constituency some swings are a few feet away from old people's newly built bungalows. The authority made the decision, probably looking at a map, but not going to the neighbourhood to see the effect.<br><br>
Community councils should be allowed to make proposals to the decisionmaking authority about parks, school areas, streets and housing. There are many other examples. I have mentioned housing. It is important to bear in mind that house improvement may be enhanced by giving community councils the function of making recommendations to the decision-making body of the kind of housing that will fit local needs.<br><br>
An example that comes to mind most readily, and one which is sadly neglected, is the provision of housing for disabled
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0166">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 293</span>
people. We pass more resolutions on this subject that we provide action to provide the right kind of housing with the right kind of fitments to meet the kind of disabilities that may be discovered only if there is community interest to evaluate the problem.<br><br>
With housing development, both private and public building on the peripheries of urban areas, new neighbourhood problems are created. We have often heard of the great problems of new towns. This is an outstanding example of how a new community finds it difficult to discover cohesion, because it has been brought together from various areas of some conurbation.<br><br>
Housing must be related to school requirements. Here, too, a neighbourhood interest would impress upon the decisionmaking body the population character of the neighbourhood. Planning authorities, dealing with a housing programme for the neighbourhood, may take into account the character of the people, not just sit down and see how best to arrange a block of houses or flats to comply with contractual terms.<br><br>
Community councils could do much about conservation. I need not deal with that subject. More has been said about pollution than any other subject, with the possible exception of population problems. A local authority would be far more sensitive to the problems of conservation than would an authority operating from far away.<br><br>
Minor development schemes could be devised by such a neighbourhood council. A minor highway scheme, for instance, could be brought within its functions. A community council should have power to nominate members to old people's homes committees, children's homes committees and school governor boards. This gives the councils a meaning. This would create such interest that we would probably get higher percentage turn-outs for elections for such councillors than we would for higher authorities.<br><br>
This is not an exaggeration, because those of us who looked at county council election figures when we first discussed Clause 1 saw that the common experience was to have a larger turn-out in local authorities than in the larger county areas. If we accept the concern that has been expressed by hon. Members
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 294</span>
opposite—if we consider the proposals that have been put forward already and then make a further assertion that a community council must represent a neighbourhood, which is in itself an organic social unity with a feeling of belonging that comes from the people themselves, we can have the kind of arrangement which my hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Mr. Blenkinsop) mentioned a little while ago. We cannot expect to have community councils in every part of England and Wales. We cannot expect them to be uniform. They must reflect the character of the people, and take into account their activities. We are not necessarily talking about a geographical entity or a geographical area which we have become used to by the examination of parish council boundaries.<br><br>
These areas must be made up according to the nature and character of a people. A large rural area, which might be easily defined for geographical purposes as a neighbourhood, but within which the people have no affiliation with each other whatsoever, would not be a neighbourhood area. Research Paper No. 9, which the Redcliffe-Maud Commission authorised, takes into account the characteristics of the people rather than the geographical circumstances. In that sense, and in the sense of our Amendments—particularly New Clause No. 1—we could then have community or neighbourhood areas with the proper functions and a proper place in local government reorganisation.<br><br>
The Minister has so far disappointed us on the matter of provincial councils. I hope that he will take seriously into account the need to make the neighbourhoods the soul of local government. That is where local government really belongs—where the grass roots really are. I detect in the Bill the beginnings of what, without the recommendations that I and my hon. Friends have offered, might be a bureaucratic system. The life-blood of local government starts from the bottom. If the Minister will give some indication that he accepts that, and some further encouragement beyond what the Under-Secretary said, I am certain that we on this side of the Committee might well be satisfied.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Development (Mr. Graham Page)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It might be to the convenience of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0167">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 295</span>
Committee if I expressed my hopes—they can only be hopes—about this debate and this Sitting of the Committee. I had hoped that we might reach a decision tonight on this Amendment, Sir Stephen, which would mean keeping you from the Chairman's chop for a little longer than 7 o'clock. If we were to continue after 7 o'clock the Committee would probably wish to adjourn for a period. Judging by the number of hon. Members who are rising to speak now, I should have thought that we might be able to reach a decision on the Amendment by 7.30 p.m.</span></p>
<p>6.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is somewhat optimistic. A number of speeches have been made by hon. Gentlemen opposite, and we are delighted to have heard them. Four hon. Gentlemen opposite rose to their feet a moment ago and I would rather like to hear them. I hope that the Minister would like to hear them. Furthermore, I had intended to reply to the speech of the Under-Secretary, and I do not think that that can be done by 7.30 p.m. It would be pushing the Committee to a ludicrous degree. It would be better to adjourn at a reasonable time, and return to this debate later, so that everyone could have his say. That is what Committees are about. They are not about steam-rollering.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is quite irregular. We have no Motion for discussion before us. We had better get on with the debate. Perhaps talks may take place and I may be informed of their result, so that I may decide what action I should take with regard to the general comfort of hon. Members for the rest of this Sitting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David James</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Charles Morrison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At least I have taken note of the remarks on the point of order—which was not a point of order—made by my hon. Friend the Minister of State. I shall try to keep my remarks reasonably short. The hon. Member for The Hartlepools (Mr. Leadbitter) talked about the grass roots, and I am with him in what he implied. In that respect it is worth referring to paragraph 375 of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 296</span>
Redcliffe-Maud Report. The Commission undertook a community attitudes survey which demonstrated that more than three-quarters of those interviewed were conscious of belonging to a definable area, which was described as the home area. In the rural areas nearly half associated this area with the civil parish.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am having great difficulty in hearing the hon. Member because of the buzz of excited comment upon his speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morrison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Sir Stephen. I shall try to speak a little louder if the noise increases any further. The survey referred to the rural areas but I believe it has similar implications for the urban areas which we are now discussing. The survey showed that only 2 per cent. of the people thought of the rural district as the home area, whereas 85 per cent. thought of it as the parish, or something smaller. This is important in relation to the Amendments that we are now discussing—which refer either to community councils or parish councils in the smaller boroughs.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary made some helpful remarks in his introductory speech. Having listened to all the speeches that have been made so far—and, hopefully, I believe that the speeches which remain to be made will be along similar lines—I hope that at the end of the debate my hon. Friend will be able to make a commitment in principle to cover the point. Unless there is a sudden outburst of opposition to the Amendment, it would seem to be agreed on both sides of the Committee that it is important that what has been referred to as the gap, or the vacuum, or the hole in the blanket of the new pattern of local government, should be filled. I hope, therefore, that my hon. Friend will take note of that.<br><br>
It is of the utmost importance that continuity should be maintained in boroughs and urban districts. We are concerned with the need to provide and introduce a new and efficient system of local government. However, local government is also concerned with people. If we forget that fact for a moment we shall do the country a great disservice. There should be a sense of community in any given area. Many places do not possess a sufficient sense of community. However, that sense
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0168">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 297</span>
is undoubtedly helped in the boroughs by the existence of existing local councils. Let no one say that that sense of community is unimportant. The hon. Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) dealt implicitly with that point. Only when one looks at the larger urban sprawls, or the largest housing estates which possess no community facilities, does one realise the extent of the lack of community spirit.<br><br>
If, during your spare moments, Sir Stephen, you could find time to visit the exhibition of the Young Volunteer Force immediately outside this room the importance of a community spirit would be obvious to you and to other members of the Committee. The Young Volunteer Force was originated by the hon. Member for Small Heath, who should be congratulated on founding it. Furthermore, this Committee may think it not wholly unlucky that the Chairman of that Group is at present making a speech in Committee Room 12. Thus, a number of members of the Committee realise the importance of the development of a community spirit, and councils in these borough and urban areas—and continuing councils under the new pattern of local government—will be of considerable help in achieving that end.<br><br>
The functions referred to by the hon. Member for The Hartlepools (Mr. Lead-bitter) may be important. Community councils and parish councils may not be able to perform with great success all the functions that he mentioned but they have a part to play. They can help to ensure a reduction of material and social deprivation. Even more important, they can reduce what might be called spiritual deprivation—the one thing that makes people feel that they belong to an area and are part of a community—a self-supporting social unit. For that unit to exist successfully, a council has an important part to play, since it helps to provide a structure which might otherwise be missing, much to the disadvantage of the people who live in the area.<br><br>
I hope, therefore, that my hon. Friend will ensure that there is continuity in terms of the borough and urban areas.<br><br>
I now wish to refer to Amendment No. 224, moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack). It is a good idea in the boroughs, when they become part of the new system of local
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 298</span>
government, that the chairman of the parish council—or, as I should prefer it to be called, the town council—should continue to be called the mayor. Within one of those areas the mayor is a most important person. In the first place, to make someone mayor is to honour him for services to the area over a period of years.<br><br>
Secondly, and even more important, the mayor—whether he is a mayor such as we know today, who may exist only for one year or a mayor who, under the new system, is similar to the chairman of a parish or other council and can be in office for a number of years—forms the pinnacle of the pyramid in the area. He may be not only an executive but a symbolic figure. Again, a little symbolism may well assist in promoting community spirit, if there is someone who may add a little pomp and ceromny to local affairs and who can lead the local parishioners to church on Sunday.<br><br>
Who will carry out the functions at present performed by the mayor, if he does not exist in future? Who will visit the old people's homes in the borough, or tour the hospitals on Christmas Day? Someone who is called "chairman" will not carry anything like the same weight as someone called "mayor". Merely to call someone a mayor within a borough would not detract in any way from the effectiveness of the new system, which, as my hon. Friend knows, I basically support very strongly. If, in future, it is possible to have an official whom one may continue to call "mayor", it will help considerably to ease the transition to the new system of local government.<br><br>
In conclusion, I wish to cite the example of a borough in my own constituency—the Borough of Devizes. I have received letters from that borough, as well as from the Borough of Marlborough. Devizes is a very ancient borough. Incidentally, I do not think that my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack) told the Committee why he had referred in his Amendment only to boroughs prior to 1700.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cormack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend and I felt that we should have some guide line. However, we are quite willing to alter the Amendment. The last great batch of charters was issued by James II between 1685 and 1688, and we felt that that was a good dividing line.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0169">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 299</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morrison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I agree with my hon. Friend's argument. I suspect that a considerable number of small boroughs received their charters following the Industrial Revolution, and within many of which it is of the greatest importance that a community spirit should be upheld.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cormack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I stress that we were searching for a guide line, and that 1700 seemed a reasonable date for the title "ancient borough". However, we should be happy to redraft the Amendment in accordance with my hon. Friend's wishes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morrison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will take note of that point and produce the perfect Amendment to cover the point that I have made.<br><br>
The ancient borough of Devizes was granted its charter by a king whose wife was called Queen Maud. It has been somewhat wounding—if not insulting—to Devizes that the beginning of the end of that ancient borough should have stemmed from a mere lord. Indeed, it is wounding to these ancient and small boroughs suddenly to be told that they are to go out of existence, even if at some future time something will be put in their stead, albeit something less important. For all those reasons it is important that these boroughs should have councils in order to ease the transition to the new system.</span></p>
<p>7 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has raised the point. The question of ancient boroughs is of vital importance and should not be neglected, but will the hon. Gentleman bear in mind that many ancient boroughs—mine, in particular, which has a charter of 700 years—were reorganised as a local government unit not quite five years ago. On that test, while the Redcliffe-Maud Commission was sitting it was considered to be a useful unit of local government for years to come. Will the hon. Gentleman bear in mind that not only ancient boroughs but also boroughs which are not so ancient qualify for the interest that we are trying to put forward because of their community interest and size?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morrison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will bear in mind what the hon. Gentleman has said. I wish to draw my remarks to an end. I hope
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 300</span>
that my Friend the Under-Secretary will give serious consideration to the points that have been made by everyone who has spoken so far—and, no doubt, by everyone who remains to speak. I am certain that without the bridge of a new council in these ancient borough areas the success of the new system of local government is likely to be harmed considerably.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ray Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to deal first with some of the points raised by the hon. Member for Devizes (Mr. Charles Morrison) and almost every point made by the hon. Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack), whose argument was laced with tradition and the question of mayorships—later taken up by the hon. Member for Devizes. Both his speech and the points made by the hon. Member for Devizes drew the line between the views of hon. Members opposite and the Government and the Ministers about the way in which we should reorganise local government, and what should be the basic concept of local and central government.<br><br>
Among hon. Members opposite there seems to be a compulsive urge—a need, almost—to look back into the mists of antiquity in order to discover the correct and appropriate form for local government in 1971. At times the hon. Member for Cannock seemed to be going back and forth in my vision—sometimes coming back dressed in ermine with a tri-coloured hat. He seems over-concerned with the whole concept of tradition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cormack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A tricorne hat. I should love to wear a tri-coloured hat. Perhaps the hon. Member would give me one after this session.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A tricorne hat.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cormack</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to refer the hon. Gentleman to the remarks made by his hon. Friend the Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) this morning in a moving and eloquent speech, in which he explained the tremendous importance of this sort of ceremonial.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that there is as much distance between the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) and myself as there is between the hon. Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack) and myself. Mayoralty does not occupy the position in local government and democracy that both hon. Gentlemen ascribe to it. I have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0170">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 301</span>
been a member of a rural district council which had a chairman, and the chairman carried out all the functions that would normally be carried out by a mayor. He was accorded all the respect, and carried as much dignity, as would a mayor. That position had the added advantage that it was not surrounded by any kind of mysticism. I see hat an hon. Member from Scotland is laughing; he has had a rather more august title than mayor. He would probably disagree with me. He would probably disagree with me. My own feeling is that such things as mayorships—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morrison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mayoralties!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>:—prevent us from getting to the heart of the matter. The subject of community councils serves as a useful starting point, because I start from the premise that it is the community we should be considering; in other words, the ground-swell of public opinion and attitudes, not the top tier of the pyramid, the mayor.<br><br>
Starting from that point, we are more likely to come to the right decision and conclusion at the end of the day than if we over-extend ourselves trying to find solutions to problems arising out of the past. I am not certain that we should not retain mayors; what I am saying is that we should not preoccupy ourselves with the position of mayors in local government. I would do away with them, because I think that they hinder us. I think that all the trappings of tradition surrounding them are positive hindrances. Metaphorically, I should like to put a ball on the end of their chain.<br><br>
What is good enough for Wales is certainly good enough for England. I cannot see why the Government have left out of the Bill so far a concept for England similar to that for Wales. I have listened to the Minister with interest and one hopes that, after having listened to this debate today, before long we shall see in print the Government's proposals for England, as they are in principle contained in new Clause No. 1.<br><br>
What should he at the heart of our discussions is precisely what form local government should take in the last quarter of the twentieth century, based as it should be on the needs of the community. Judging by my short time as a Member of Parliament, the community has vastly different needs in 1971 from the needs it
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 302</span>
had in 1951. At my advice bureau every weekend people come to me with problems of housing, planning, education, and social security, problems which, frankly, should not come to me at all. I have my advice bureau in a local school and to some extent I act as a substitute for a community council. People come to me in desperation because they cannot go anywhere else.<br><br>
For example, Birmingham has a quarter of a million municiple houses; a quarter of a million tenants, who, when they have problems, have to find their way to Bush House in the centre of the city. Good as the housing department staff are—and they are excellent people—they simply cannot deal with a problem of that size. They could deal with it administratively and in organisational terms, but not in strictly human terms.<br><br>
People come to me in the hope that I can somehow break into the bureaucratic spiral. On some occasions I can help them. Because of inefficiency in a monolithic, highly centralised structure of that kind, dealing with a quarter of a million tenancies, people are lost to view. An hon. Member may help to put human problems before those administering the system.<br><br>
I should have thought that on housing alone there was a strong case to be made out for a community council. Indeed, I would go much further with housing. I should like housing councils to be established on municipal estates to carry on a large part of the administration of the estate themselves. The best form of discipline is self-discipline. If one can encourage people and make it possible for them to run their own affairs one is more likely to achieve the right degree of social responsibility.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) mentioned planning and the Skeffington Inquiry. Planning as now operated leaves much to be desired. In my short time as a Member of Parliament, I have come across two or three planning cases which have caused great offence in my constituency. For example, two of them concerned petrol stations. No effort was made by the public works committee to ascertain the views, opinions and attitudes of people in the locality where the petrol station was to be sited. I am not suggesting that if we had had a more democratic approach to the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0171">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 303</span>
problem we should not ultimately still have got the petrol station: we probably would, but I am convinced that the people in the area would better have understood why the petrol station was needed.<br><br>
If one can start off in an open, informative way, people are more susceptible to logical argument. Sometimes the local people would win the day, but in the vast majority of cases, when a decision is seen to be right, the majority of people in the community would always support it.<br><br>
Those problems occurred in a ward in my constituency which has between 27,000 and 30,000 electors. I suppose that that would give a population of about 65,000 people. That ward is represented by three councillors. The three councillors and myself form the sum total of representation for those people. The three councillors certainly cannot do their job properly, for they do it on a voluntary basis and they do not have the time.<br><br>
As I argued the principle of unitary authorities, within the great urban areas I should like to see the kind of democratic sounding-board we have in the rural areas. The rural areas have their parishes.<br><br>
When I first went into local government and learnt what the parish councils did and what powers they had, I thought them of no value, but as I progressed I realised that they were of immense value, and that nothing happened in the average parish or the average village without Mr. and Mrs. Joe Smith at the end of the longest terrace, or in the deepest part of the countryside, knowing about it, and making their views known. That does not apply in our great cities.<br><br>
It has been said that our boroughs are fine institutions. They may be at the top, but not at the bottom. Any one of the 65,000 people in any ward in my constituency—and I have three such wards—has to take an eight-mile bus ride into the city to discuss any local authority matter. One may try to find the local councillor, but the three councillors are only part-time. There are many parishes of only a few hundred persons, but a unit of that size, 65,000 people, should be democratically represented. Whether we give that representation functions and powers is another matter and a subject for another debate, but people should be able, through
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 304</span>
some representation, to have their views discussed by a community council of some kind.<br><br>
There are three large wards in my constituency, each containing 25,000 to 30,000 electors, but throughout the constituency there are a number of "urban villages" based on the old rural villages. King's Norton, for example, is an old village which now lies at the centre of a massive urban sprawl. Similarly, North-field village lies at the heart of a great industrial and commercial building complex. But such communities think of themselves very much as villages. Probably mine is the only constituency in Birmingham which has a local newspaper, and the sense of vitality that that local newspaper gives to the community is out of all proportion to its rather poor readership. People know that when something happens in the community—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure my hon. Friend would not wish to do the <i>New Town News,</i> which circulates in my constituency, a disservice. It is produced by the churches, but is nevertheless community-oriented, and it provides more useful local news than any other media.</span></p>
<p>7.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that, and there are a number of other such newspapers throughout the city. I referred to the <i>Northfield Messenger,</i> and if my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove (Mr. Terry Davis) complains—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot sit quiet. My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Carter) must recognise that the <i>Northfield Messenger</i> is only the <i>Bromsgrove Messenger</i> masquerading under a different name.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is true. The <i>Northfield Messenger</i> is the <i>Bromsgrove Messenger</i> with the front and back of the paper removed, and the Northfield news put on the outside. I am pleased to say that most weeks I am somewhere to be found mentioned on one of those two pages. What my hon. Friend has said is the perfect example of the erosion of this kind of community activity in our urban areas. At one time, the <i>Northfield Messenger</i> would have been a major newspaper in Birmingham, but now it is not. Most of us would be happy to see far more community participation in the urban areas. I see evidence of the need every weekend

at my advice bureau, and every day in my postbag.<br><br>
I close my contribution by asking the Minister to take seriously what I have said about the greater involvement of the community in public and civic life. That is what lies at the heart of the Bill. I should not like to feel that in serving on the Committee I had spent my time supporting legislation which had as its inspiration the practices, the ideals and the concepts of the past. They are not to be rejected, but they should be incorporated within the framework of a Bill which is based on the direct and imperative needs of the community as opposed to the traditions of a past age which axe no longer relevant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Evelyn King</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not easy coherently to debate a Clause with 23 grouped Amendments, few of which have much in connection with one another. One can only dip one's hand into the rag bag and bring up something. I dipped in my hand and the first thing I brought out was name. Much of the debate has centred around a name, and that concept is not unimportant. Four names have been discussed. The hon. Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) referred to neighbourhood community; then there was the parish, the borough and the town. Here I disagree with my hon. Friend the Member for Devizes (Mr. Charles Morrison) who wishes to use the word "town" rather than "parish". I take the Minister's point that any small authority that is created must clearly be seen not to rival the authority of the bigger power which will exist.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morrison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should say with regard to the use of the word "town" in Amendment No. 87 that there is a strong argument for naming the council in an urban or borough area—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the hon. Member would mind addressing the Chair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morrison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Sir Stephen. There is a strong argument for calling the council in what is at present a borough or urban district the "town" council, because in many of those boroughs there is more than one church parish. That alone is a strong argument for calling the council the "town" council.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. King</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the point about the church, but if there is a subordinate
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 306</span>
authority which bears the name "town" council, or any name incorporating the word "town," there is likely to be misunderstanding between that and the district authority, because "town" may well sound more important than "district." For that reason I much prefer the word "parish." I link that with the argument for the word "mayor," because if the words "mayor" and "parish" are linked it will not only maintain dignity but it will be perfectly clear that it is a subordinate authority and diminish the possibility of misplaced loyalties.<br><br>
The other possible name to apply, which I think is ugly, is "neighbourhood community." There has been an excess of Birmingham tonight. Three Members for Birmingham wanted the name "neighbourhood community." It may well be that they are right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not from Birmingham.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. King</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But when one comes to an area such as I represent, I should have thought that that terminology was not very appropriate.<br><br>
Amendment No. 233, in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, West (Mr. Wingfield Digby) seeks to ensure that boroughs, and rural and urban districts, automatically and immediately become parish councils with power to retain their property.<br><br>
I support Amendment No. 88, suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Northants, South (Mr. Arthur Jones). It is supported by eight Dorset boroughs and, I think, by the hon. Member for Dorset, North and by all Dorset Members. Thirdly, Amendment No. 224, in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack) seeks to provide a mayor for the ancient boroughs.<br><br>
These three Amendments raise similar questions. First, should we have a large community within the district? In order to be as brief as possible, I answer, "Yes". Then I raise the question, which I know is in the mind of the Minister, whether such a borough seeks to detract from the loyalty they seek to create. I can speak only in terms of my own district. One of my difficulties is that districts have not yet been defined by the Boundary Commission and it is an extremely difficult discussion to carry on, but I submit that where there is a borough with a population of 3,000 to 4,000, 30 or 40 miles away from the borough forming
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0173">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 307</span>
the central part of the district—and where, in addition, the new and the small borough bears only the name of the parish, the continued existence of the mayor will create the troubles suggested.<br><br>
The second question is how to define a district of the sort which should have added powers. Two methods have been proposed. One is a district with a population under 30,000 and the other the definition, as in the Amendment, of an "ancient borough". I do not think it beyond the wit of Ministers to strike a definition that will be acceptable to us all.<br><br>
I will touch briefly on the question of ownership of property which figures in one of the Amendments and is a problem with which I hope the Minister will deal. Most small borough, or parish councils—call them what you will—own property. If they cease to exist what will happen to that property? I hope that ownership will be retained.<br><br>
I fully understand the necessity of retaining powers. That leads me to what I call dignities. On this the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield was to some extent, in error. There are many circumstances in human nature in which people cannot be given power. I am not in favour of giving powers to small authorities, because that is inefficient.<br><br>
There is scarcely a situation in which human beings ought not to be given dignity. That is a totally different argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely the point that I was trying to make. I was not necessarily talking about the functions which we should allow authorities to perform, or the powers that we should give them but in the first instance we should create a democratically-elected body which can debate all the issues affecting the community of which the individual is a part.</span></p>
<p>7.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. King</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Member's point, but we must not underrate the value of dignity in the formation of a community. I want to refer particularly to my own town, in which I take a special interest. Wareham, in Dorset, has
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 308</span>
had a mayor for 800 years. I hope that the Under-Secretary will not extinguish a dignity that has lasted for eight centuries, and for which I am not asking for power. I merely ask for its continuance.<br><br>
I speak not only of mayors but of local dignities of all kinds. I have a newspaper cutting of something that took place at Wareham last week. The cutting refers to:
<br><blockquote><p>"… the 'Court Leet and View of Frankpledge of the Lord of the Manor and Borough'."</p></blockquote>
when, traditionally, they went round, the bread was weighed, the beer was tested, the chimneys were searched, and then officers were elected. They elected the hayward, the bread weighers, the chimney peepers, the ale tasters, the canisters, mayor's constables, scavengers and leather sealers. I do not think that the hon. Gentleman would like any of this, but I think that it is rather fun. Afterwards they had a jolly good supper, provided by the Lord of the Manor. Surely no one wants to prevent the Lord of the Manor giving my constituents a good supper. At least I hope not. These are the sort of dignities, in a town with a population of 3,000, which are very enjoyable. At the summit I should like to see the mayor. That is a reasonable proposition.<br><br>
The mayor symbolises something worth retaining. One hon. Member referred to Christmas Day, and another may have referred to charities, but anyone who has lived in a small town knows how a thousand worthwhile things go on, and to some extent depend upon and are encouraged by visits from the mayor. What does one gain by taking away a mayor from a parish of that kind, remote as he is likely to be when a new authority is created? I am not asking for any particular powers.<br><br>
I ask my hon. Friends to have some sympathy for those valuable 800-year-old traditions that exist and give nearly every town a better opinion of themselves, strengthening their local roots and the dignity of human nature.</span></p>
