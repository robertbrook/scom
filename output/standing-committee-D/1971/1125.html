	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In welcoming the Committee I am sure that I express the view of all hon. Members in saying how sorry we were to hear of the Minister's local disorganisation, and we hope that he is fully recovered. We congratulate him on being here to move the Sittings Motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Development (Mr. Graham Page)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Sir Stephen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the Local Government Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.—[	<i>Mr. Graham Page.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a Financial Resolution. There is no need to read it to you. Copies are available in the room. Before I call the Procedure Motion, may I remind the Committee that adequate notice should be given to Amendments: as a general rule I do not intend to call manuscript Amendments. I have also had put on the Tables of the Committee copies of my provisional selection of amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Bill be considered in the following order, namely, Clause 1; Schedule 1; Clauses 2 to 9; Schedule 2; Clauses 10 to 19; Schedule 3; Clauses 20 and 21; Schedule 4; Clauses 22 to 39; Schedule 5; Clauses 40 to 47; Schedule 6; Clause 48; Schedule 7; Clauses 49 to 55; Schedule 8; Clauses 56 to 65; Schedule 9; Clause 66; Schedule 10; Clauses 67 to 79; Schedule 11; Clauses 80 to 99; Schedule 12; Clauses 100 to 166; Schedule 13; Clauses 167 to 174; Schedule 14; Clause 175; Schedule 15; Clauses 176 and 177; Schedule 16; Clause 178; Schedule 17; Clause 179; Schedule 18; Clause 180; Schedule 19; Clause 181; Schedule 20; Clause 182; Schedule 21; Clauses 183 to 187; Schedule 22; Clause 188; Schedule 23; Clauses 189 to 195; Schedule 24; Clause 196; Schedule 25; Clauses 197 to 205; Schedule 26; Clauses 206 to 208; Schedule 27; Clauses 209 and 210; Schedule 28; the remaining Clauses; new Clauses; the remaining Schedules; and new Schedules.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not propose to quarrel with this method of order; it is probably the most satisfactory way of dealing with it from the Committee's point of view. However, I hope that the Minister, and all of us, will bear in mind that should Schedule 1 come reasonably early during our proceedings we ought to allow sufficient time for very detailed Amendments on particular administrative areas and points concerned with them. I hope the Minister will have that fully in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. We are bound to get very detailed Amendments on this Schedule and, as I said on Second Reading, I am only too happy that there should be debates in detail on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is one other point of which I am reminded. I take it that maps will be clearly available to the Committee when we come to the Schedule?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not thought of that, but it is a very good idea.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Roper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will it be possible for the Minister to ensure that there are in the Library maps showing the ward boundaries referred to in Schedule 1 so that we may consult them? Maps have been laid concerning the wards which have been divided in Part III of Schedule 1, but at this stage there are no maps in the Library concerning the wards which are delineated in Schedule 1. I hope that can be arranged before we get on to that Schedule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we can make arrangements for the maps to be made available, they will, of course, show any items which are mentioned in Schedule 1. This would not go as far as showing any expected districts within the counties. All we are dealing with here are the county boundaries, and if they divide parishes or other areas it will be shown on these maps, if I can make them available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brynmor John</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. The proposals affecting Wales are a matter of bitter controversy and the tacking together of the two Bills into one is, similarly, a matter of controversy. However, the result is that on this Committee of 50 there are only eight Welsh Members, who have to scrutinise the legislation on behalf of all 36.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0012">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
My point of order, Sir Stephen, is that the self-confessed author of these proposals for Wales is the Secretary of State for Wales, who is not a member of the Committee. May I ask your guidance on Standing Order No. 62 as to whether, if the Committee of Selection were to suggest at some stage that one or more hon. Members be discharged from the Committee and that the Secretary of State for Wales, the author of this Bill, be added to the Committee, you would sympathetically regard this request?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is not a matter for me; it is a matter for the Committee of Selection. The Bill has been sent to the Committee by the House, and it is our job to get on which its consideration. Whilst I should give sympathetic consideration to anything which the Committee of Selection did, it is not for me at this stage to anticipate what it might do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When are the maps that have been referred to likely to be ready? Many of us are being pressed by a large number of authorities and, whilst we are aware that there have been 60 changes since Circular 8 was issued in February, it is difficult for Members to address themselves to the submissions made to them without some visual picture of the changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whilst the Minister has been good enough to indicate that it is a good idea, and reference has been made to the possibility of there being maps in the Library, it is more important that individual members of a Committee should know when we are likely to have the maps and whether they will show precisely the changes that have been made since February so that we can make contributions on behalf of the authorities which have made submissions to us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will certainly be my intention that they should show those details. I cannot promise that they will be ready before the weekend, but I shall say that we will have them ready by Monday. Looking at the Notice Paper, I should not think that we would reach Schedule 1 by Monday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Cocks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me reinforce what my colleague has said about maps. It has been represented to me by very high-ranking officials in local authorities that the failure to issue a set of maps with the Bill has caused them considerable trouble.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
May I have an assurance from the Minister that Members of the Committee will not be confined to scrabbling together in the Library, crowding around one set of maps in order to try to clear up the very complex points which are being raised with us, as individual members of the Committee, from areas where, with the best will in the world, we probably have never been and are extremely unlikely to go.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sir Stephen, in view of the very inferior quality of the picture above your head, could it be replaced for the duration by a suitable large map?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that we can issue two maps to each member of the Committee, so that if a member wants to consult his local authority on a certain particular he can send a map, and say, "Mark it up, and send it back to me". I think that this would be most convenient, if hon. Members agree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Laurance Reed</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I suggest that we have some relief maps of the geography of the countryside—a very important element—and that we draw accurate boundaries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Bill be considered in the following order, namely, Clause 1; Schedule 1; Clauses 2 to 9; Schedule 2; Clauses 10 to 19; Schedule 3; Clauses 20 and 21; Schedule 4; Clauses 22 to 39; Schedule 5; Clauses 40 to 47; Schedule 6; Clause 48; Schedule 7; Clauses 49 to 55; Schedule 8; Clauses 56 to 65; Schedule 9; Clause 66; Schedule 10; Clauses 67 to 79; Schedule 11; Clauses 80 to 99; Schedule 12; Clauses 100 to 166; Schedule 13; Clauses 167 to 174; Schedule 14; Clause 175; Schedule 15; Clauses 176 and 177; Schedule 16; Clause 178; Schedule 17; Clause 179; Schedule 18; Clause 180; Schedule 19; Clause 181; Schedule 20; Clause 182; Schedule 21; Clauses 183 to 187; Schedule 22; Clause 188; Schedule 23; Clauses 189 to 195; Schedule 24; Clause 196; Schedule 25; Clauses 197 to 205; Schedule 26; Clauses 206 to 208; Schedule 27; Clauses, 209 and 210; Schedule 28; the remaining Clauses; new Clauses; the remaining Schedules; and new Schedules.</p></blockquote></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say first of all, Sir Stephen, that I only heard after your reference to it this morning of the indisposition of the Minister. May I offer him our sympathy from this side. We have not all been in that position exactly ourselves, but we can use our imagination and compassion. May I also point out that the Secretary of State knows almost as much about this Bill as the Minister and, had he been here, it might have been of some relief to the Minister and perhaps for the convenience of the rest of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In speaking to this large series of Amendments, I can do no better than to quote the words of the Minister himself in his speech on Second Reading, since they explain very clearly why this series of Amendments has been introduced. The Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A significant point which has emerged during the debate is that no one seriously has urged the previous Government's unitary system, except perhaps the hon. Member for Sutton. Indeed, no
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
one could plead for a return to that unitary system idea who wanted closeness between councillors and the citizens. No one could plead to go back to the unitary system, with its massive authorities which would have been so remote from the people."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 16th November, 1971; Vol. 826, 	<i>c.</i> 340.]</p></blockquote>
It is not correct to say, and the Minister, having re-read HANSARD, will probably agree with me now, that the unitary system was not mentioned and was not advocated. I myself referred to it, and in some detail, but my trouble is that I tend to look at these things dispassionately, to see advantages and disadvantages in things, and therefore to state those disadvantages, rather than make a purely coloured case for something without giving the objections that there may be to it. I suggest that the Minister, who shares the same profession as I, ought to take the same view, though there are times, particularly in his enthusiasm, which we are all glad to see so much part of his personality, when he tends to disregard the objections to a particular scheme for the advantages that he believes that scheme will bring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a very real difference between us. We, or most of us—for no doubt there will be differences of opinion on this side—favour the unitary system, and always did. On Second Reading, we were faced with a Bill which had been prepared by the Government. It was our duty to consider that Bill and not to consider an alternative Bill, since we are not the Government. Therefore, it seemed appropriate to make a passing reference—quite a long reference in a speech of 27 minutes—to the unitary question, then to leave it and spend rather more time dealing with the Bill itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, Sir Stephen, on that occasion I spoke for 27 minutes but I notice that even that did not satisfy a group of hon. Gentlemen who immediately put down an Early Day Motion saying that Front Bench speakers had spoken far too long. I shudder to think what they would have said if I had gone into even greater detail on the unitary system. I must admit that it was not with that in prospect but with the general convenience of the House that I rather cut short my speech on that question. With your indulgence, Sir Stephen, I may spend a little more time this morning in filling in the details I might have put on Second Reading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may interrupt the hon. Gentleman, I have no intention of preventing him from making the speech
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0014">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
he wishes to make, but I am sure that he will agree with me that he himself has made perfectly clear that we ought to consider what is proposed in this Bill rather than something else. Within that general view, I have no objection to the hon. Gentleman making a speech on unitary authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wholeheartedly agree. Sir Stephen. This is a Bill to
	<br><blockquote><p>"Make provision with respect to local government and the functions of local authorities in England and Wales …'</p></blockquote>
and within those terms I propose to keep wholly to the rules of order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is basically by Amendment, therefore, that one can put across the idea of the unitary authority. I must concede fully that I see no opportunity, no occasion, no chance whatever to convert many hon. Gentlemen here today to my point of view, but it is as well that they should be aware that this is a difference between us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason why they should be aware of it is this. I hope that I am not misjudging him, but I think that the Minister takes the view that, basically, anything that concerns local government and its reform is a matter of pure detail. One gets together a group of details, a group of provisions, one draws maps one way, one draws maps another way, and being the tolerant and kind-hearted man he is, he will listen—he always has done—to the points of view expressed by other people, and even make concessions to those points of view from time to time, but what he does not appreciate is that we are dealing with a point of principle. This is not one lot of details against another; it is one principle against a set of details calling itself a principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first point is that the unitary system was designed to cure the division between town and country in the organisation of services. Whatever one's views on the unitary system or the two-tier system or what emerged as something in between in the Redcliffe-Maud proposals, that remains a paramount aim. All of us who have had any concern with local government felt that the gap between town and country, inevitably in the area in which we live, had widened; that this was unreal; that, on the whole,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
the town dweller wished to go into the country—the motorcar makes this available to him—and the country dweller wished to shop in the town and the two became more and more involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point is the desire to have one planning authority dealing with the total planning of an area. On Second Reading, I think I said that the basis behind the 1947 Town and Country Planning Act was to create 140 planning authorities. Even this may appear to pure planners—if one can use that adjective with the word "planners"—to be going too far and the figure should be much smaller. At any rate that was the accepted figure in 1947. The basis of this Local Government Bill is to provide something like 420 different planning authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said to the Secretary of State and to the Minister that, working within the context which they were working—and possibly that is where the misunderstanding arose between the Minister and I, and when he says that I was commending things, I was within the context which was given me and not within the question of the general principle—it may well be that we have reached fairly nearly where we ought to be, but I submit that the context itself is wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one had had the unitary system—as modified, of course—it would have been possible to cut down the number of planning authorities and they all would have been able to have the same sort of powers in the planning field, and I maintain that that would have been an advantage. We shall seek to show—and perhaps to remedy, if we are fortunate—that there will be considerable conflict as a result of the Bill between one set of planners and another, and this cannot be to the advantage of planning in general in this country. However, this is obviously a matter for a later stage, and I promised to keep to the rules of order. I thought that I ought to mention it at this moment, because it is germane to the whole question of the unitary authority and the present Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third basis to which I should like to refer is that what we now have under the Bill, and would not have had under the Redcliffe-Maud proposals, is that there are separate services administered—there is a logic for it, I have to admit—in different ways by different authorities. One of the great advantages of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0015">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
unitary system was that all the services were administered together, and I think we have lost as a result of this. So that also is something that weighs with us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally, I made reference on Second Reading to the question of education. I pointed out the advantages which an authority like the I.L.E.A. has in providing education. I do not say that if one provides education at the district council level it will be inefficient—I do not believe that—but there are tremendous advantages in having a much larger educational authority. I pointed out that it could cope with the many minority interests—the handicapped children, the blind, the deaf, and so on—and that this is a positive advantage in our educational system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At least if we are never to agree on anything else in this Committee, Sir Stephen, I think that I would carry every hon. Member with me if I say that we all want to provide the best possible system of education. It would be very pleasant if we could then agree on what that was. Unfortunately we cannot, but that is the legitimate controversy between political parties. But certainly where something is proven, as it has been with I.L.E.A., it ought not, in my view, lightly to be dropped. So that was the fourth point that I had to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fifth point I made is that if one is a member of the public, as we all are, another factor comes into one's consideration. We are members of the public with a difference. We are members of the public with considerable knowledge. That knowledge does not come immediately. It comes as one serves in this House, and one then begins to learn, even if one has not served on a local authority, as so many of us have, more and more about the workings of local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any hon. Member here knows perfectly well what it is to go to his surgery, to his advice centre, on a Friday evening, or whenever it is that he goes, knowing what questions will be asked of him. And the overwhelming majority of questions concern themselves with local authorities. We get an expertise—I cannot say that we become the world's greatest experts—but we certainly have a greater expertise than ordinary members of the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Just consider ordinary members of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
public. We all pay a great deal of lip service—perhaps that is an unkind word, because we mean it genuinely—but we all pay tribute to the idea of local democracy. We all believe in it. We all say that it is right that people should rule themselves, govern themselves, at the local level as well as at the national level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But we forget sometimes how confusing it is, how very confusing, even when one has set out as carefully and strongly as possible to make ordinary people aware of what their rights are; how many different conflicting authorities there already are at the moment, but how many conflicting authorities there will be if the Bill becomes law, at any rate unchanged. We have divided services, we have divided educational responsibilities, we have divided planning responsibilities. Inevitably, people will seek help from their local authorities, which they are perfectly entitled to do, yet not having the faintest idea which authority to go to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope as consideration of the Bill proceeds to give some pretty concrete illustrations of what is likely to happen. I always maintain that I am the only—perhaps the hon. Lady the Member for Merton and Morden (Miss Fookes) is the only other, I do not know—disinterested member of the Committee, in the sense that I am a London Member and we had our troubles many years ago and they are now settled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may give an illustration immediately: if on a problem of planning affecting him, one of my constituents, an ordinary member of the public, comes to me for advice, it may be that the logical thing is for me to go to the Borough of Lewisham in which my constituency is situated. But it may very well be that I must go to the G.L.C., and even I—and I have some knowledge of planning from a professional point of view and some acquaintance with it in this House—am sometimes very hard put to it to know exactly where to go. But one taking the country as a whole, these difficulties will be enormous, and it is the ordinary citizen we should be protecting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is all very well to get clear, dovetailing proposals—not that we are, because I think that the Minister is realistic enough to know that many of his proposals are bound to have conflicting objections to them—but, with the best will in the world, the system which he has advocated will intensify this confusion and this muddle.

And, I repeat, it is the ordinary citizen whom we should be protecting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading I mentioned what I thought were the disadvantages of the unitary system. Again, I did it because I wanted a clear picture to emerge, and not a biased picture. If the Minister is to take this attitude as being wholehearted appraisal of his proposals and whole-hearted condemnation of what I believe in, I must be very careful about my wording in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It happens, certainly on a theme like local government, that most of the decisions one has to take, most of the ideas one has to consider, are a balance, and it is absurd to pretend that they are anything but a balance; and there is, at any rate, a disadvantage of some sort in the unitary system. It can be remote, and I said so. I do not think that that disqualifies it, because one can certainly introduce elements into that unitary system which will make it less remote, one of them being the basis of community councils, and we will be returning to that question, I hope, later in our consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was the basis of what I was trying to say on Second Reading, and to a large extent it is the basis of this present series of Amendments. The Minister could say, and here I am afraid I must be a little less than gracious to him, that our proper course in that case was to move a reasoned Second Reading Amendment asking for a unitary system. But one had to consider a Bill—a very large Bill, as the Minister himself quite rightly pointed out—and merely to single out one particular point, however much of a point of principle it was to me, as a reason for rejecting the Bill would have meant that one would, apart from that, have given the impression of being satisfied with the rest of the Bill. And we are not satisfied with the rest of the Bill. We believe fundamentally that it is a bad Bill because it will not work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried, Sir Stephen, to set out as concisely as I can, and within the rules of order that you yourself suggested to me, what is the principle behind this series of Amendments. We have to consider them very long and very properly as a Committee. They are really germane to the whole subject. I have never yet heard a strong argument, other than that of remoteness, against the unitary system. Every other argument that can be made against it goes back to the past and does not look ahead to the future. I believe
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
that, although I have no great optimism as to the fate of these Amendments. Disraeli once said, "A majority is always the best repartee", and I am conscious that I face a majority. Yet, at the same time, if the Committee can fully consider this point it may clarify for many of us what seems to me to be a point of intense principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support what my right hon. Friend the Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) has said on the question of unitary authorities for a number of other reasons. As Members are aware, the Redcliffe-Maud Commission, a completely independent body, sat for 181 days and interviewed 2,156 witnesses before reaching its conclusions. As my right hon. Friend said, its conclusions were definitely in favour of unitary authorities. On balance, I think that unitary authorities are a far better, more democratic and efficient form of local government. I agree that it is a question of balance, but the Government have not given adequate reasons either in their White Paper or on Second Reading for their drastic departure from the Report which the previous Government, despite some faults in the system, were prepared in principle to accept from that independent Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another aspect of unitary authorities which my right hon. Friend did not mention is that of attracting the right kind of people to serve on local authorities. All hon. Members will agree that for both political parties it is becoming a problem in local government to attract people of the right calibre and experience, and willing to serve the community. With a unitary authority, since the power lies in that authority, there is a possibility of getting such people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Graham Page) will explain how he expects to attract that kind of person to the district councils proposed in the Bill. The counties are responsible for education and social services. Those will be the two prime spending services and, from the point of view of the public, two of the most important services administered by local government. The person going on to the district council will have no say in the running of those services. He will have a say in some minor matters such as filling
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0017">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
potholes in roads, planning permission for pigeon lofts, and that sort of thing, while the real decisions are being taken not at district level—and the district is much bigger than the present borough or urban district—but at county level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation is worsened by the fact that there has been no reorganisation of local government finance at all. The county will therefore be the precepting authority. The county will precept the rate; it will be the poor district councillor who has to collect it. As the American colonists would have said, it is clearly a case of taxation without representation from the district councillor's point of view. He carries the can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will a man serve on a district council when he has the responsiblity of facing the electorate with regard to rates which will be made up primarily of the precept from the county council and not from the district council? Will he serve, when his powers are so limited? Will the best kind of officers serve on district councils when they find that the powers are so limited? There will be great difficulties in attracting people to serve at the district council level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Redcliffe-Maud Commission fore-saw this problem. Consequently, it proposed that in what is a basically urban country the best and most democratic form of local government and the one which would attract the best people to serve in local government, both as officers and members, would be a system of unitary authorities. The Government have not explained why they have departed so widely from the Report of that independent Commission. I should like the hon. Member for Crosby to explain in more detail this departure from a Report on balance true—although with some parts I would not agree with—and much more up to date, efficient and democratic than anything proposed in the Bill</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Blenkinsop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a very fundamental series of Amendments and it is right that we should consider it at the very beginning of our proceedings. It always appeared to me that the Redcliffe-Maud Report was trying to concentrate people's attention upon the issue, among others of course, of clarity of local government structure. Redcliffe-Maud returned to this question time and time again because he was eager to find a way of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
encouraging more people to understand the local government structure, and to be able to work it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One question which must be very much in our minds is whether the new proposals which we shall be discussing for some considerable time offer a better opportunity for people to understand the system they are working, and therefore will encourage them both to take part in it as elected councillors and also to make use of the services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know that that is a problem which we continuously face in local government as it is today. We know that even after all these years large numbers of our constituents still do not understand, and have every reason not to understand, the way in which their local administration works and who is responsible for what. Therefore we must take great care to try to ensure that in the place of this vast administrative structure we are putting a new structure which offers really major opportunities for improvement in this respect. Very sincerely, I doubt whether the Bill does so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the attractions of a unitary system was undoubtedly that, at any rate in so far as a unitary system could be followed fully, it did offer that clarity. I quite accept that both the Redcliffe-Maud recommendations and the last Government's White Paper made all kinds of special provisions which clashed with the unitary principle. Many exceptions were made. One understands that. But in so far as the unitary principle was applied, it seemed a clear principle and one which enormously helped people to understand the service they would be calling upon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In considering the present proposals, my own authority, although it does not pretend to be strongly opposed to them as they stand in so far as it is affected by them, would much have preferred to retain its own complete authority, which is the basis of the concept of the unitary service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Throughout consideration of the Bill at all levels one of my deepest anxieties will be to find out how we can give new opportunities to ordinary people to take part in local government, and to make fuller use than they do of the services already available. My great worry is that in the Bill, perhaps inevitably, the way in which the services are divided up, the division of functions between the different authorities—we must not say "tiers"—which are sup-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0018">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
posed to be of equal importance inevitably leads to complication.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I very much suspect that as we go along we shall discover that a whole range of new joint bodies will almost inevitably be needed to deal with particular problems as they arise. The county will not prove adequate to deal with quite a lot of the wider questions which will arise covering an even larger area. We shall need this kind of combination. I hope that we shall also consider at some stage the grass roots position
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear very much indeed, right at this early stage, that we shall replace a structure which is complicated and difficult for people to understand with another which is highly complicated and almost equally difficult to understand. Therefore, one of the major reasons for bringing forward the whole concept of reform is being vitiated right from the start.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is on that basis that one must examine the proposals and give fresh consideration to the unitary principle and its detailed working out in order to see whether we cannot do something better than this Bill offers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denis Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are in some difficulty in discussing this great batch of Amendments. I think that it is right to deal with them all together, but it causes some difficulty, in that we are discussing not only the principle of the unitary authority but the whole of Annex 1, which we propose should replace Schedule 1 in order to implement the unitary authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall start my speech with some remarks on the general principle and then refer to Annex 1, Unit 25(	<i>f</i>) as it affects the Birmingham Metropolitan District. The Midlands is inadequately represented on the Government side of the Committee. The Minister conceded in his earlier remarks that in a Bill like this, which seeks to redraw the boundaries of every local authority in the country, the local authorities and those whom they represent are entitled to discuss the way in which the Bill affects them. It must follow, 	<i>ipso facto,</i> that they are entitled to have a discussion on the way in which the proposals of the Labour Party Members on this Committee affect them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If those of us who represent the Midlands, for example, were to start in one speech to deal with every proposal that we have about the Midlands it would be in-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
tolerably long. Nevertheless, we have a duty to see that this point is examined, and it is therefore necessary to say that we may have to make a number of shorter interventions, in the hope that the Ministers will reply to our specific points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I support what my right hon. Friend the Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) said about the principles of unitary authorities. The extraordinary thing about all the proposals before us, as my hon. Friend the Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) said earlier, is that nowhere in the Government's White Paper, or in the speeches of the four Ministers who spoke in the Second Reading debate, has there been any attempt to demolish the case for unitary authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have just spent some time re-reading the White Paper. It is a most extraordinary proposition that we should establish a Royal Commission of the quality of the Redcliffe-Maud, that it should spend so much time on reaching its conclusions and putting them forward so cogently for the House and the Government to consider, and then be dismissed by the Government in such a cursory manner. My right hon. Friend suggests that we should have spent more time on the unitary system in the Second Reading debate. All the speeches made it clear that we strongly disapproved of the system for two-tier counties and thought that, logically, we should go back to Redcliffe-Maud. We did not need to argue the Redcliffe-Maud proposals for unitary authorities because that job had been done much more adequately and skilfully by the Royal Commission than we could have achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth while reminding ourselves of the case on which Redcliffe-Maud rested. It is contained in paragraphs 252 and 253 of Vol. 1 of the Report. Para 252 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is great strength in the all-purpose authority; and this has been shown in the county borough councils. Not all of them have exploited their potential strength to the full, partly because their areas have been inadequate, partly because their organisation has been fragmented. But where a county borough council under strong leadership has co-ordinated its services and set out to achieve objectives through the use of all its powers, it has been the most effective local government unit we have known."</p></blockquote>
That puts the point as forcibly as it can be put, and we are entitled to ask the Government—who have not yet even started to try to demolish that argument—to tell us what case can be put up against that compelling argument of the Royal
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0019">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
Commission. What is the case against the all-purpose authority?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Royal Commission supports its argument in para 253; indeed, it could be argued that all the preceding 250 paras support the argument, and that para 252 is the conclusion. Para 253 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A single authority has the great advantage that, through allocation of priorities and co-ordinated use of resources, it can relate its programmes for all services to coherent objectives for the future progress of its area considered as a whole."</p></blockquote>
That is the case. Before we depart from it, therefore, we must be very careful to establish the priorities and the co-ordination of services, not only in planning but in education, housing, and many other services. We all have lists of things that we think more important than others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After sitting for two or three years, Redcliffe-Maud reached the conclusion that the all-purpose authority was the most effective form of local government and the one which ought to be sustained in our local government system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not at this point deploy the arguments against the two-tier system which the Government are to introduce. It is sufficient for this Amendment to argue only the case for the unitary authority—the all-purpose authority—and to hear for the first time the argument against it. I hope that the Minister will deal with this sooner rather than later, since it will be meaningless to continue to argue in a vacuum—as we are at present—the case presented by Redcliffe-Maud, no reply having been presented by the Minister or anyone else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall take one example in regard to the Birmingham and West Midlands position, on which I should like to spend a little time. I refer to what many people call the clash between town and country. In the Second Reading debate I said that the whole history of local government from 1945 to the present day has shown that all the problems arise in our large conurbations, and that they have not the means to solve them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problems of slums, inadequate breathing space for the people and inadequate land for industrial building can be seen by those who represent large conurbations. Everywhere the surrounding county authorities have taken the view that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
"what we have we hold". They will not voluntarily provide the land which will enable London, Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, the Merseyside, and so on, to solve their problems. It is natural that people who have got on well and are enjoying life should want to have some peace and quiet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember one occasion when an hon. Member said that the people of Tring violently objected to receiving any London overspill. That is another way of saying "I'm all right, Jack". One million people in London live in unsatisfactory conditions—in furnished and unfurnished accommodation—without proper sanitary arrangements. The position of those people cannot be alleviated unless the people of Tring and similar places are prepared to be helpful in terms of the release of land to enable other houses to be built in their areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That situation also exists in the West Midlands. Birmingham and, to a lesser extent, the Black Country and Wolverhampton, have found themselves throughout the years denied the land and the opportunities to solve problems which are the responsibility of local authorities. We have had planning conferences, Ministerial interventions, and local authorities coming together. There have been one or two chinks of light. It has not all been black. I pay tribute to the cases in which there has been light. I refer particularly to a distinguished member of the party opposite—Sir Alfred Owen. When he was Chairman of the Shropshire County Council he did what he could to provide land in that country for Birmingham overspill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But these have been exceptions. Whenever proposals have been put forward to build houses to relieve the serious situation that exists in Birmingham there has been a considerable degree of resistance to them. I understand resistance by people who have moved out into country areas, but Parliament, Government and local authorities have a responsibility for making it possible to build houses to relieve the shame that faces thousands of families in our society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One argument for the Redcliffe-Maud proposals is that they sought to bring together authorities in sufficiently large areas, so that the local authority in which the problem arose was given the means of solving it. Later, we shall deal with the way in which the Government
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0020">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
propose to tackle the matter, and shall proceed to show to the satisfaction of the Committee how inadequate the Government proposals are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to Annex 1, on page 244 of Volume 1, dealing with Unit 25(	<i>f</i>)—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are in difficulty here. If I cannot make the case for the unitary authority for Birmingham on this Amendment I cannot make it anywhere, as your interjection from the Chair demonstrated, Sir Stephen. We are discussing Amendment No. 5, among others, and it is obligatory upon the Opposition, when saying that we want a unitary authority, to argue for the replacement of Schedule 1. I know that it puts the Minister in great difficulty, because it may mean having two debates on the same subject. I understand that, and I do not want to trespass too far. Nevertheless, there is a responsibility upon hon. Members on this side of the Committee to explain what sort of Schedule should replace the one in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are seeking to delete Schedule 1 and to replace it by our own Schedule. Therefore, on this first Amendment we must be able to make a case for what we want to insert. If we do not do it, and he Amendment is defeated, you will very
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
properly rule that we cannot make our case at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman appreciates that I have not attempted to rule him out of order. He is quite in order. I have no objection to his making references to the Schedule, or to his own area. I am saying only that I hope that he will not argue 	<i>in extenso.</i> We should concentrate more on the principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no necessity to argue 	<i>in extenso.</i> I referred to the point because I understood that there might be some confusion among hon. Members opposite. I am glad that you understand the position, Sir Stephen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the Bill is not being taken on the Floor of the House the people who will be affected by these local government changes will expect the Committee to examine them. My hon. Friends and I must spend a lot of time swotting up the case on behalf of people who are not represented on the Committee. It would be quite intolerable and would undermine the faith of people in our democratic processes if, because a local authority that feels aggrieved has no member sitting on the Committee, its case were to go by default. Therefore, one of our responsibilities is to examine these cases. That is why I said that I might have to return to this point in other parts of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be for the convenience of the Committee to divide our discussion up, in order that somebody can take on the responsibility of obtaining a statement of Government policy about each area. That is what we want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now refer to Unit 25(	<i>f</i>) in Annex 1, as it affects the Birmingham metropolitan district as recommended by Redcliffe-Maud. I have received a letter from the hon. Member for Meriden (Mr. Speed), whom I am glad to see here. He has asked whether the speech that I made in the Second Reading debate represents the policy of the Labour Party, since that is of great importance to his constituency. What with unemployment, lobbies, and preparing for the Committee, I must apologise to the hon. Gentleman for not having had time to answer his letter. Perhaps he will be more satisfied if he has the answer to the letter now, in Committee, so that it will be on record in HANSARD and he may refer to it. The policy of the Labour Party in respect of his constituency is represented
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0021">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
by Amendment No. 1. We believe that the Redcliffe-Maud proposals for the West Midlands should be broadly implemented. The Report says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We consider that Solihull, Sutton Coldfield, parts of Meriden rural district and part of Stratford-on-Avon rural district must form part of the metropolitan area; and, further, that their links with Birmingham are so strong—much stronger than their links with each other—that it would not be feasible to make them a separate metropolitan district."</p></blockquote>
I think there is very great force in that argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I notice the hon. Member for Meriden (Mr. Speed) looks satisfied by it. He no doubt thinks he has enough ammunition there for political campaigning to retain his seat at the next election. It is not for me to comment on whether he will retain his seat but, if the present state of unemployment continues, there will be very few of those facing us now who will retain their seats, and certainly not the hon. Member for Meriden, who will have to explain a large number of redundancies—but I would be out of order if I went very far in that direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true, of course, that Sutton Coldfield, Solihull and large parts of Meriden owe their being to the fact that Birmingham is there and that Birmingham industry is there. That is why Sutton Coldfield and Solihull exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have great admiration for much that those local authorities do. I know many of the men serving on them, and I know that, over the years, they have sought to give their citizens in the commuter belt the support they need. One of the things that we are suffering from in Birmingham is that the city is having to pay a very large price for the support given by Sutton Coldfield and Solihull to a fantastic road programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those of us who represent inner constituencies in Birmingham, and who face squalid slums that should have been got rid of years ago, and schools of inadequate size, know that this is where the first priority of the City of Birmingham should lie, because it is here that we touch mostly upon the lives of our citizens. However, successive city councils in Birmingham—I am not making a party point here—have decided that the greatest of all financial priorities for Birmingham is to provide adequate motorways so that the people of Sutton Coldfield and Solihull can come to Birmingham to earn their
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
livelihood and get out of the city again as fast as possible when their day's work is done. Anyone who represents a seat in Birmingham or who comes from Birmingham knows this to be the truth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So I tell the hon. Member for Meriden and others that what he is seeking to protect, he is seeking to protect at the expense of the electors and the ratepayers of the City of Birmingham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can multiply that argument in almost every conurbation. It is not an argument which is exclusively applied to Birmingham. It happens to be the case. Redcliffe-Maud therefore said: "We know that there are 60,000 homeless in Birmingham. We know that there are another 40,000 or 50,000 people still living in slums and inadequate conditions. We know that there are some terrible schools. We know that there are no playing fields where the people of that great city can spread themselves, and play, and enjoy life. We will seek to recognise and identify the problem, and to produce a solution to that problem within one all-purpose authority".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That, in a nutshell, is the case for the unitary authority. In this respect, the White Paper never even approaches the case, much less seeks to demolish it. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will tell us at a very early stage why the Government rejected the concept of the unitary authority—the all-purpose authority—and why they rejected the proposition that where problems are identified in terms of local government reorganisation, solutions should be bound to the problems—because that is the proposition which the Government put forward. The contrary proposition, that problems and solutions should go hand in hand in sensible local government terms, is the proposition which we seek to sustain in the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that there is an unwritten rule in Committee that hon. Members on this side should be silent or, if not silent, brief. I shall endeavour to be brief, but I want to make one or two points in reply to the various arguments that have been made from the other side this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I begirt by disagreeing very violently with the hon. Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell). I come from a part of the West Midlands where
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0022">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
the Redcliffe-Maud proposals were greeted with great dismay and great opposition. People there view with tremendous alarm the possibility of being included in the metropolitan area and dominated by Birmingham. This should go on record. This opposition was by no means confined to people in my political party. Many people in the hon. Gentleman's party were equally angry about those proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his opening remarks, and I thought that he developed his case with enormous moderation and great skill, the right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) talked about the objections to the unitary authority. He said that he had heard only one really strong argument against the unitary authority, and that was the argument of remoteness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could go along with a lot of what he said about the confusion in powers. Certainly, when he talked about planning he had many valid points which we shall have a chance to develop later at greater length. However, I suggest to him that that one argument of remoteness, is in itself sufficiently strong to be overriding. He is just as concerned as we all are with local democracy and he made that point. The one thing that could be destructive of real local democracy, which means contact between elected and electors, could be these very large unitary authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The enormous value of the system which now, I think we all agree, needs replacing, has been that in many cases local people have known their local councillors. Even if there has been a certain confusion in their minds as to what particular power resided with this authority or that, they have known their councillors as people, and this is very important. Had we gone on to the system of unitary authorities, personal knowledge and contact would inevitably have disappeared in many cases, because the councillors on the unitary authorities would have had enormous constituencies to represent. Had they tried to combine that with their ordinary daily work and daily lives, they would inevitably have had very little contact with the people whom they represented.

One could argue that that would have led to the advent of the professional politician on local councils, and that those who served on unitary authorities would not have had a chance to do anything else other than be councillors, so they would have been able to devote time to seeing their constituents and discussing
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
their problems with them. I contend that that development in itself, logical as it would have been, would have been destructive of local democracy, because although I was glad to hear what the Secretary of State said on Second Reading about the payment for local councillors, I would be absolutely opposed to the day coming when all local councillors were professional politicians.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The great weakness of the Redcliffe-Maud proposals was that the second-tier authorities, which were not really second-tier authorities at all—the community councils—were toothless wonders, and would have had tremendous difficulty in enlisting the interest of people to serve on them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Member say, first, whether salaried Members of Parliament are destructive of democracy in localities? Secondly, does he not agree that the present large county councils are really a full-time job for county councillors, but because county councillors are unpaid there is an unbalanced age structure, in that there is a preponderance of retired people and insufficient people of working age who have to make their living and who cannot simply afford to devote their time to local administration? Would he not agree that full-time councillors would obviate that grave weakness in our local democracy at the moment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a case for paying local councillors, and on the new major authorities many of them will be paid. They will be in receipt of many sorts of expenses, allowances, and so on. There is a case, and a case which I readily conceded in my remarks a moment or two ago. One cannot equate the position of a Member of Parliament with that of the local councillor. I am sure the hon. Gentleman, if he really pondered that, would not wish to press that equation very far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But there is a very strong case for the district council with real powers. No-one can deny that the district councils as envisaged in the Bill have real powers, and it will be perfectly possible for people of good calibre, pursuing their daily lives and work, to serve on these district councils. This is one of the strengths of the proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know the object of this discussion at the moment. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>27</span>
the Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack) is wasting the time of the Committee, in which case he will be most unpopular with his Minister, but whatever he says, it is obvious to me that he is arguing with himself. Whichever line he takes, whether he speaks in favour of unity or, perhaps, authorities, or whether he speaks in favour of the system which his own Government are now adopting or hope to adopt in the future, these councils will, by definition, all be larger than they are now or have been in the past. It is obvious to me that thousands of these small councils are being abolished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member may argue that it is important for a member of a local council to be in a small, intimate, parochial atmosphere and, therefore, in touch with his electors and able to be the communicator of his electors' views and wishes to the council if he goes 20, 30, 40 miles away to a meeting at the county hall, under this new setup, in 1973-74 we shall see nothing but larger units of which the councillor is the spokesman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I ought to say at the outset, on the Committee's very first day, that whilst interruptions are allowed provided the hon. Member gives way, one should not have speeches within speeches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank you for that very wise intervention, Sir Stephen. May I now ask the hon. Member whether he will answer my question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am tempted to ask you, Sir Stephen: which question? Which speech? All that one is trying to say, and it is a terribly important point, is that if we had unitary authorities there would be just one large council, and that, inevitably, the councillors would have very large constituencies and very many constituents, and would be remote from the people they represented. This danger, which was felt throughout the country, in all political parties, is overcome by the present proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not develop this argument too much, or I should make a very long speech, which I have no intention of doing. At this point I will sit down, saying once again that I believe that the Bill gets over the great danger of Redcliffe-Maud; that unitary authorities are not an effective substitute for real local democracy and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
would endanger and jeopardise it throughout the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack) suggested—and I think that he was very serious about it—that it was the convention that hon. Members on the Government side should sit silent. I have not heard of it before, but I am sure he said that. He made this apology before developing his speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said "sit silent or be brief"; and that I intended to be brief. I was rather longer than I intended, because of a long intervention from the other side.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member referred to the convention of being silent or being brief, or both, and I am suggesting that this Bill has been got together so hurriedly that I should have thought that it is the responsibility of hon. Members opposite to speak. The submissions made by hon. Members on both sides in the past few days suggest there is a direct, immediate and urgent concern about the impact of the Bill. More than that, there is concern in the country by every local authority about the manner in which it will be dealt with in a year when the legislative programme is heavy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In such circumstances, the hon. Member cannot be seriously suggesting silence or brevity on his side. We are dealing with a complex range of matters concerning the lives of every person in the country—the whole of the personal social services, the whole of the educational system, the whole of the magisterial system, the whole of the local government structure—yet the hon. Member says that he is satisfied, otherwise he would not have said it, that there should be silence and brevity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I really think that the hon. Member is being too serious by half. If he cannot recognise a slight pleasantry at the beginning of a speech, it is a pity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the whole point. I have considerable experience of Standing Committees. The Under-Secretary of State for the Environment will recall the long sessions of the Transport Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Michael Heseltine)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly appreciate that the hon. Member

on that occasion was neither brief nor silent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that occasion I was sitting on the Government side and, as the Under-Secretary says, I spoke at some length because the matters were sufficiently important to have our attention directed towards each item in that long Bill. But his hon. Friend says the opposite. He is now on the Government side on a Bill of similar length but greater complexity, yet now, he refers after another intervention, to his suggestion of silence and brevity as a pleasantry. Therefore, at the beginning of a very long Committee stage he is indicating the posture he intends to adopt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas Swain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the speech made by the hon. Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack) implies that hon. Members opposite who represent constituencies with vital interests in the Bill will be disenfranchised when it comes to speech-making but franchised, in opposition, in hundreds of cases, to their own opinions expressed at local level, when it comes to voting?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend is right to make this observation but, more than that, I have noticed that the Minister, who has a very shrewd eye on these matters, must have felt a twinge of worry to find that his hon. Friends do not seek to back him up with words, or criticise him. However, we shall leave the point. It has been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment gives me the opportunity to question the hurried compilation of this Bill. Paragraph 6 of Circular 8/71, which was sent to local authorities in February of this year, reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Consultations on areas will take place in the light of the Government's decisions, set out in the White Paper …"</p></blockquote>
I am disturbed because since then the Bill has been prepared. It is a very long Bill, with 30 Schedules, 351 pages, and therefore in this Amendment, when we are questioning the nature of the structure of local government as proposed by the Government it is important to test the extent to which consultations have taken place so we can be satisfied that other considerations have been met which have been outlined in the White Paper produced by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
Paragraph 7 of the White Paper states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If local authorities are to provide services effectively and economically, their areas should be large enough in size, population and resources to meet administrative needs, …"</p></blockquote>
That is an important criterion by which to approach an examination of local government reorganisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But then the paragraph goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… including the maintenance and development of a trained and expert local government service: boundaries should be drawn so that areas take account of patterns of development and travel: and services which are closely linked should be in the hands of the same authority."</p></blockquote>
If this approach to local government is valid, and I suggest that it is, it is reasonable and proper to ask to what extent consultations were undertaken in order to satisfy the needs of that paragraph. The Minister came to my area, and was there for two days. He spent one day discussing the matter with the authorities on the Teesside, principally, and then on another day he spent some time discussing it with authorities in the areas in the Wear and Tyneside conurbation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was not, however, consultation in the sense that we understand it. All the authorities in the total area were brought together, because in the Minister's mind, and, I am quite certain, in the Government's mind, was the thought of haste in achieving the objectives of a preconceived timetable in seeking to neutralise argument and discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was not a semblance of consultation in bringing together, for instance, representatives of Hartlepool, Teesside, Stockton, Easington, the peripheral areas of Guisborough and Loftus, and the Circular 8/71 areas in the North Riding of Yorkshire. Each of these authorities with special interests were bound to have conflicting views about what ought to be done, so those views of individual authorities were not fully taken into account, nor was there time to do it, although I must admit that submissions were made in writing, but again under a timetable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities received their first request in February 1971, and they had to make submissions by May. In between February and May there are local elections, the administration of local government for a very large part of that period is confined to the electoral requirements,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0025">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
and local authority officials are hard-pressed with their normal administrative routine daily needs as well as their election problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So here we have this very large and complex Bill influenced by recommendations which I have sought to prove have not been arranged in an order and in a manner which can be described as having had the best representations of local authorities, both by way of written submissions in a limited timetable between February and May, and by way of very limited and distorted discussions taking place for a few hours on each of two days with conglomerations of authorities brought together under one roof.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We on this side are disturbed, whatever else is said, about such a complex Bill being produced so hurriedly. The Redcliffe-Maud Commission sat for 181 days and heard about 1,200 witnesses, although I must confess, on reflection, that the Commission did not consult that part of the world that I represent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The recommendation in the First Schedule that the Teesside county should include the county boroughs of Hartlepool and Teesside, the Stockton Rural District Council, the urban districts, among others, of Guisborough, Loftus, Satlburn, Marske, and the parishes in that area, is similar to the recommendation made by Redcliffe-Maude, so I can justifiably say,
	<br><blockquote><p>"… a plague o'both your houses!"</p></blockquote>
because this prompts in my mind something else. It is a mistake to try to reorganise local government from the centre, from Whitehall, taking into account such criteria as population, size and scale, without really taking more fully into account the characteristics of the people in the areas concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman knows from long experience I am always very reluctant to interrupt him. What he is saying is much more appropriate to a Second Reading speech than it is to the Amendment. We have an Amendment advocating that we should have unitary authorities rather than the type advocated by the Government, and the hon. Gentleman's speech must be confined to that point. By all means let him give illustrations outside those particular terms, but let him not develop it too long.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I respect your ruling, Sir Stephen, but the fact is that I must also refer to Amendment No. 5, and Amendment No. 5 refers to the Annex, and I have not come to that yet. The Under-Secretary knows full well that I have not yet come to the kernel of the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me deal with a matter of major principle, something which will satisfy the logical mind of the Under-Secretary and the shrewd approach of his Minister. The Seebohm Report was also brought about by a separate independent Commission, and it had a great deal to say about personal and social services. I have just noticed that by Clause 1 housing is to be left with the non-metropolitan districts, but all the other social and personal services are to be taken away from them. How on earth can we get near to applying the principles and recommendations of Seebohm after taking away the major social services, the real bread and butter of local government, from the districts and putting them into the counties, the metropolitan counties and the non-metropolitan counties? How can we do that and at the same time say that housing should be left with the districts?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us not assume for one moment that I am saying that housing should be taken away from the districts. But I am saying that there is a distortion in the Government's approach to the problem, again because it has been hasty. In page 2 of Circular 8 paragraph 71, after we read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The White Paper also makes it clear"—</p></blockquote>
so the Circular adds in its advice to local authorities:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a. that, in the case of authorities which will be responsible for education and the local authority personal services"—</p></blockquote>
that is the county authorities:
	<br><blockquote><p>"it is desirable to think in terms of a population base of at least 250,000 …"</p></blockquote>
It is rather too restrictive to send out Circulars to local authorities, or to ask them to produce reasonable proposals when they have already had a strait-jacket put on them in the terms of a population minimum. There are many local authorities with under 250,000 population which have excellent services. If one looks at the unit costs of all the personal services in all the local authorities in the United Kingdom one will find that county boroughs of populations of about 100,000 to 200,000 have unit costs of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0026">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
personal services below those of the larger counties. This is a true state of affairs, and it cannot be refuted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those who have thought in terms of the larger unit purely as a matter of faith or belief should reflect that in organising local government there cannot be a unified, firm and single rule based on population alone. In my constituency, with a population of 100,000 we have our own educational system, our own educational committee, our own personal services, aftercare for homes, libraries, road systems and shopping centre, and we are the only town in the whole world with a nuclear power station within its boundaries. When we have that magnificent base of achievement, with a population of 100,000 with personal social services at unit costs less than any of the major counties, how can it be justified for Parliament to say: "Let us not take note of that but, for the purposes of administrative nicety, let us put a straitjacket around the whole thing with a population commitment"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Page 2 of the Circular also says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… that the Government consider it appropriate to establish a metropolitan type of structure only in the si m areas of Merseyside …"</p></blockquote>
and then it enumerates them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the simple question: why? When the Redcliffe-Maud Report was published—and the real quality of the Report was that, the Commission having sat so long and listened to so many witnesses, at least we could justifiably say that this was a base for some suitable Amendments. It provided the climate in which Members like myself could come and say: "The principles are right, but the details here and there can now be discussed rationally".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is a hotchpotch of nonsense. It cannot be anything other than a hotchpotch, as we will find as we go along, regrettably enough. Month after month I shall be entitled to question more details than ever I could under Redcliffe-Maud because the Bill is a weak Bill. It is a Bill which cannot work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the Minister should seek during the weeks ahead to do at least what the Labour Government did with Redcliffe-Maud. For instance, they accepted from me a willingness to reexamine within the unitary system local government reorganisation on Teesside. More than that, the Labour Party, at the request of local authorities, set up its own
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
working party, which recommended a metropolitan base for Teesside which would have given places like Darlington, Stockton Rural District and Hartlepool a metropolitan base, instead of having the nonsense we have here where, in order to excuse themselves, the Government say, "We will preserve the identity of the non-metropolitan county districts and we will let you have a mayor. You will have the mayor, the mace, and all the trappings of civil dignity, and be left with dealing with the dustbins."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not what we want. In the towns which for many years—under charter and Royal Charter—have had borough status—Hartlepool has had it for 700 years and all the 83 borough councils could make similar claims—there cannot be a civic dignity and an identification of an urban area unless it is given the functions to go with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having spoken for the first occasion this morning very briefly—there will be some 2-hour speeches, 3-hour speeches, all-night burning of oil, because this Bill needs attention and we want hon. Members opposite to speak—I end by saying that there is only one other example to match the reluctance of hon. Members opposite to speak on the Bill and that is when they did not have the guts to go out and see the unemployed yesterday—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Stephen. Is it in order for the hon. Gentleman to make such outrageous and utterly inaccurate statements?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure the hon. Gentleman was about to conclude his speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was ending on a note of fact. However, I must leave that matter because it is not in the Bill and hon. Members must not press me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make one appeal on Clause 1 at this stage. I ask the Minister to bear in mind that the great and fundamental error in the Bill, is that his Department has got it together far too quickly and, while I should like to convey to him my regret that the Secretary of State is ill, his Department knows that this Bill will take months to examine, and it would have been helpful, even in his temporary absence, if the right hon. Gentleman could have been included as a member of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0027">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>35</span>
Committee so that we could have asked him some questions directly on this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In speaking to these Amendments, I accept the principle of unitary authorities and I will not go into the arguments already advanced about the principle and, therefore, the first Amendment, except to deal with the objections raised by the hon. Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack), who is the only person so far to have opposed the principle of unitary authorities and who did so, I think, on the ground of remoteness. Whether or not a unitary authority is remote from its electors depends on its size. There is a case for saying that there should be unitary authorities. It would be possible to have unitary authorities which would be much smaller than the units of local government under the Government's proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before dealing with my own area of Worcestershire, let me say that I speak not only as a representative of a constituency which has two-tier government at the moment but also as one who has had experience, as a member of a rural district council, of the frustrations of two-tier government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In speaking of Worcestershire, I want particularly to refer to North Worcestershire. My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) said that the policy of the Labour Party is that the Redcliffe-Maud proposals should be broadly implemented. I was grateful for his reassurance, because I object to the proposals for that part of North Worcestershire which is defined as Unit 25 (	<i>g</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As it is at the moment—and as it would be even more so under the Government's proposal—we suffer from remoteness in North Worcestershire because we are governed from Worcester. Under the proposal for an amalgamation of Worcestershire and Herefordshire there would be even more remoteness. I do not say that remoteness would be reduced by acceptance of Amendment No. 5, which would include North Worcestershire in the West Midlands metropolitan area. In order to reduce the remoteness of local government, in my opinion we need a unitary authority for North Worcestershire based on the area defined as Unit 25 (	<i>g</i>). Thep opulation of this area is already more than one-third
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
of the population of the area in the Government's proposals which they tentatively call—I hope that it is only tentatively—Malvernshire. By 1980 the area of North Worcestershire will account for half the population of this larger county.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Small Heath referred to the difficulty that exists between town and country. He will probably accept that that was a slight oversimplification. In North Worcestershire the difficulty is not so much between town and country as between the West Midlands conurbation and the area outside. The Redcliffe-Maud proposals are opposed by people from my constituency and the rest of North Worcestershire because they would include us in the West Midlands area. They would therefore make us much closer—indeed, we believe too close—to the conurbation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not that we do not want to provide land to help solve the housing problem of Birmingham; we do not want urban sprawl. We do not want to see the conurbation stretching not merely from Birmingham to Wolverhampton and Cannock but down to Redditch and beyond. Our objection is based on planning. We accept that there is a responsibility to the rest of the Wést Midlands region to assist the conurbation in its housing problem, but that problem cannot be solved on the basis of the West Midlands metropolitan area either as proposed by the Government or as suggested by Redcliffe-Maud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, the West Midlands metropolitan area is too small under either set of proposals to solve the problem. It is a regional problem, and it needs a regional approach. Indeed, there are the first signs of a regional approach to the problem in the recent report published by the West Midlands planning authorities which suggested the dispersal of population from the conurbation and the selection of growth points, rather than a simple extension of the conurbation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
North Worcestershire is very different from the rest of Worcestershire and Herefordshire. We have some agriculture, it is true, but less than the rest of Worcestershire and Herefordshire. We have much more industry, and a large number of industrial towns. We also have many commuters. It is true that we are associated with the conurbation, as I believe are the constituents of the hon. Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack), because we commute into the conurbation in order to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0028">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>37</span>
work. But that does not mean we want to be part of the local government of the conurbation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In North Worcestershire we are very suspicious of Birmingham, and we have good cause to be suspicious. This is not a party political point. We have good cause to be suspicious because time and time again Birmingham City Council has looked to North Worcestershire for housing land. Let no one say that I am not conscious of that housing problem. But the answer is not simply to build and build, to extend and expand that swelling conurbation of the West Midlands. That is what we oppose. Time and again the city council has tried to grab more land from North Worcestershire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a party political point, because on the last occasion Birmingham City Council was led by the Conservative Party. It was aided and abetted in its land-grabbing designs by the Worcestershire County Council, also dominated by the Conservative Party. The Conservatives of North Worcestershire opposed it, but the deal was done in a smoke-filled room between the Conservatives on Birmingham City Council and the Conservatives on the Worcestershire County Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It took a Labour Minister to say that there should be a planning appeal and an inquiry, and then it took a Conservative Minister to uphold the decision of that appeal—so it is not a party political point. As a result of the decision the Conservatives of Birmingham City Council, who had already lost the support of the Worcestershire Conservatives, were told to look elsewhere to solve Birmingham's housing problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let it not be thought that we are equally happy to remain part of Worcestershire, or to be part of a new county of Worcestershire and Herefordshire. I shall not take up the Committee's time this morning to make that case, but let me say that these suspicions exist because of the past history of collusion between Worcester and Birmingham and also because there is some dissatisfaction in North Worcestershire with the service that we receive from the Worcestershire County Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the principle of unitary authorities, but I oppose the boundary of the West Midlands metropolitan area as put forward by Redcliffe-Maud. I hope that we shall have the opportunity to vote separately on the Amendments. I am not quite clear on that point. But if I vote for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
Amendment No. 5 I want it to be clearly understood that I do so with a reservation about the southern boundary of the West Midlands metropolitan area, because we do not accept it. I believe that North Worcestershire could stand on its own feet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will probably recall that the whole point about the Redcliffe-Maud proposals was that within the principle—and we maintain that the present Bill has no principle behind it—it was highly flexible and was intended to be so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that point, but the Redcliffe-Maud Report does include North Worcestershire as part of the metropolitan area. Indeed, we should have two-tier local government in North Worcestershire under either set of proposals. I object to both sets. I want to see a unitary authority for North Worcestershire which can stand on its own feet, run its own education service, and have both the rateable value and the population to justify it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The area is growing extremely rapidly. We have a new town at Redditch. On the latest proposals the population of North Worcestershire will be 400,000 by the 1980s. My constituency will have a population of 160,000. We can certainly go it alone. We shall make the case for doing so at a later date, but I insist that we wish to do so on the basis of a unitary authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I first want to express the gratitude of the Committee to the hon. Member for The Hartlepools (Mr. Leadbitter) for the brevity of his speech. I am sorry that he is not here now. I wished to call his attention to the fact that there is a difference between silence and brevity. I have never been accused of either, but I hope that in this Committee we can put our points briefly, because we have a lot to get through. There were two points that I wanted to clear up arising from his speech. I should like to do so now, even though he is not here, in order to dispose of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of consultations with the areas and the time of those consultations, we allotted three-and-a-half months for written representations from all the existing local authorities; we extended that period for a further month to those whose political colour had changed in the course
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0029">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>39</span>
of that period. I then had meetings with local authorities, as the hon. Member for The Hartlepools mentioned, in a number of areas, and my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary undertook meetings in other areas. We inspected the areas whose problems we discussed, although I can assure the hon. Member for The Hartlepools that I did not really need to inspect his area; it was merely a matter of refreshing my memory. I recollect the great hospitality that I have always had on my visits there—particularly that marvellous hotel at Hartlepool.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the speech of the right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin). Of course, I apologise to him at once. It may have been the intonations and inflections that he gave to his speech, but when I re-read it I realised that it was clear from the words that of course he reserved the right of the Opposition to argue that the right thing to do would be to put all local government reorganisation on a unitary authority basis. That is what we are now discussing in relation to his Amendment. He thought that local government reorganisation as put before the House by the Government was a matter of details gathered together, but that we had not set out any point of principle in that local government reform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a substantial principle at the basis of our proposals for local government reorganisation. The principle is not primarily one of efficiency, or tradition, or loyalties, or the support of the existing establishment, and it is certainly not primarily following a pattern of development, or those horrible initials, T.T.W.A.—"travel to work areas", although that was pleaded a great deal in my consultations with local authorities. Nor is it primarily a matter of population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To express it as an overall principle, into which all these factors are taken into account, it is to try to produce local government units which will be—and will be recognised as being—capable of good and humane government. Efficiency, loyalties and tradition all have their place in that principle, but we want to produce units which are capable of government over a wide area in terms of their effect on the lives of the people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for South Shields (Mr. Blenkinsop) made that point, although he was opposed to our structure proposals. He said that the important thing was that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>40</span>
people should understand local government, and where the functions are to be carried out. I entirely agree, and as we go through the Bill I hope that we shall be able to devise lines between the functions—whether they be vertical lines between two different functions or horizontal lines between parts of a function—which will be clear to the public. I hope that the Committee will assist me in that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that it is essential to make it clear to the people where the responsibilities and duties lie as between the two spheres of Government that we want to initiate in the Bill. But, as against his argument, we cannot base reform merely on tidiness. We must be flexible, because very different conditions and circumstances exist throughout the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blenkinsop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate what the hon. Gentleman says. My approach is not on the question of tidiness but on actual participation and use of services, and the understanding of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We can probably weave all that into our structure. I do not think that it goes to the principle as between unitary and two-sphere government in local government. The hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes)—and this is my first opportunity to welcome him back to the House, which I do—touched on much the same point. First, he said that he thought unitary government was more democratic and more efficient. I must deny that. We can divide the functions of government reasonably between the two spheres—one covering a wider area geographically and resourcefully and the other carrying out its functions more locally. That produces a more democratic and more efficient type of government than the unitary system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member was anxious that we should encourage the right people to serve on local authorities. I am sure that as we go on to discuss the functions of the district councils he will see that we have given them a substantial power, especially over the character of their areas. I mentioned particularly a revision that we have had in force about planning, of letting local authorities prepare the local plan, which seems to me the whole basis of the character of their districts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that there will be rating precepts from the county to the district. We have that at the present time, but I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0030">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>41</span>
should rather have the rating powers in the district than put them in the county and have the district precepting on the county. As we go through those functions I think that the hon. Member will find that we have given substantial powers to the district which will attract the right type of councillor and, at the same time—as my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack) said—will enable people to know their councillors. That is a vitally important point, which we must keep in mind in our forthcoming debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These Amendments, taken together, constitute a root-and-branch attack on the Government's whole approach to reorganisation. Their affect would be to delete all our system of counties and districts and substitute references to unitary areas, as defined either by Redcliffe-Maud or by the previous Government in their White Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our belief in the two spheres of authorities was set out in our White Paper, with our reasoning. Our case is that it is impossible to define a pattern of areas which will be equally suitable for all local government operational services. Indeed, Redcliffe-Maud recognised that in its recommendations on the metropolitan areas. Some functions need wider areas, and some decisions are better handled more locally, but unitary areas represent a sort of uneasy and impractical compromise which in some cases must necessarily result in an area too small for proper government of the major services but too big for the other functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Redcliffe-Maud acknowledged the weakness of unitary local authorities, and would have set up local councils which would have reduced the big towns—even the substantial county boroughs—to mere parish status. That was an extraordinary way to try to effect a compromise, and I think that it would have failed wholly. It was a sort of voluntary system—"You can be a parish if you like, but you need not be if you do not want to". Apart from that, there were only to be the 61 major authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We agree with Redcliffe-Maud to the extent that we were both aiming to do away with the separation of the big towns from their hinterlands, and to bring the strength of the present county borough system into the surrounding areas. When I refer to the separation of big towns from their hinterlands I speak subject, of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>42</span>
course, to the special needs and arrangements for conurbations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's proposals are based on the widely accepted belief that operational responsibility should be exercised within two spheres of government. In places we have called it two tiers, or two levels. I like to avoid that sort of phrase if I can, because it gives an idea of one authority being Big Brother to the other, and the Committee will probably appreciate that throughout the Bill we have tried to allot functions wholly to one type of authority or the other without the one having control of, or appeal to it from, the other body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This approach accepts the realities of the differing needs of different local government services. It allows real responsibility for amenities and the environment to be exercised by the local people through a district council of a size that can command the resources of the area. We do not want the small rural or urban districts that we have at present, but when we enlarge them to the suggested district councils we do not want to make them too big, so that they are remote from the people. Our proposal also permits a larger number of people to participate as members of authorities in the administration of statutory services than would have been the case under Redcliffe-Maud. It also allows a closer adherence to the existing county pattern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say that we want a larger number of people to take part in local government, and that must be obvious when one looks either at the Redcliffe-Maud division of the country or its division by the last Government. Redcliffe-Maud proposed only 61 major local authorities in the whole country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of those must have been so large—administering very local matters—as to be quite remote from the people they were administering.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Which ones?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee would not wish me to go through all 61. It is obvious. If one reads through Annex 1—with which the hon. Member is so familiar—one can see which ones would be remote. Of course they would not be remote in the densely populated areas. The 61 authorities of Redcliffe-Maud were reduced by the last Government to 56—only 56 major local authorities in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0031">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>43</span>
the whole country. Otherwise, they could be merely parish councils, if they chose to be. Those 56 authorities would surely have been extremely remote from the people, and not the right authorities to carry out the sort of functions which we are now giving to district authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now come to what the hon. Member for Birmingham, Small Heath (Mr. Denis Howell) said in the latter part of his speech. When he was dealing with some of the main principles put forward by his right hon. Friend he made some strong points. He spoke of the great strength in existing county borough councils, with which I entirely agree. These have always been our most effective local government units, but that implies that all the rest of the country will have much weaker units. What we are trying to do is to bring the administrative strength of the country boroughs—which does not necessarily depend on the fact that they are unitary authorities—into the general scheme of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I warned the hon. Member for Small Heath before he started on the details of his argument about Birmingham—but when he got on to that he was arguing wholly for the two-tier system, because Redcliffe-Maud set up three metropolitan authorities in the Country with about half a dozen metropolitan areas in each, and one of those was the metropolitan authority of the Midlands, with Birmingham as a second-tier authority. If we are to understand that the Opposition wish to stand by the Redcliffe-Maud proposals, or, indeed, by the proposals in their own White Paper, then they agree that Birmingham should be a second-tier authority, and any argument about first-tier authority based on an argument for Birmingham is really quite irrelevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What would have happened had we accepted the unitary basis of Redcliffe-Maud? We would have had the three exceptions, one of which is in the West Midlands, and the difference in powers would then have been that the metropolitan authority—the county for the West Midlands—would have taken from Birmingham all planning, even on local and small plans. It would have taken away building regulations and the vari-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>44</span>
ous other powers that are set out on page 91 of the Redcliffe-Maud Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper produced by the previous Government went much further than that. It gave responsibility for education to the metropolitan authority. Is the hon. Member for Small Heath really saying that we ought to go back to Redcliffe-Maud? Is he saying that we ought to go back to the previous Government's White Paper, and have these three areas which are two tier?—all the rest of the country being unitary. If he is saying that, he cannot talk from Birmingham's basis, because Birmingham would have been a very minor parish council under the Labour Government's proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to assure the hon. Gentleman that that view is not the view of either the majority Conservative Party or the Labour Party in Birmingham. The difficulty that,we are in arises to some degree from the point that I made central to my argument—the availability of land. The hon. Gentleman is trying to apply to Birmingham much more tightly drawn boundaries than did Redcliffe-Maud. I agree that there is an alternative, which I mentioned in my Second Reading speech—the development of provincial government. One can argue that what the Government have done on the boundaries might be right if one had provincial government. One cannot argue that there shall be no provincial government and then draw the boundaries so narrowly as to restrict the solution of the problems that exist in the areas which one is so tightly confining.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not follow that argument. The hon. Member for Small Heath is saying that the previous Government had a much larger area for Birmingham than the present Government have proposed, whether it is second tier or top tier, or whatever it may be. But in their White Paper they took away all planning, all education, and many other functions from that area. The hon. Member cannot say that because we have reduced it and given it greater powers we have not looked after Birmingham. However, we shall deal with the boundaries later in the debate; I have been led off the question of the general principles of the debate, and the high tone in which the right hon. Member for Deptford introduced his
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0032">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>45</span>
Amendment. I rise to his complaint that this Bill is merely details and say that behind it there is a very sincere principle—to improve and give a greater status to local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I tell the Minister straight away that I accept that he believes that what I regard as details form a principle. He has stated the position very clearly. If I caught his words properly—they were delivered rather faster than I can write—I hope that I will not be doing him an injustice in repeating them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He said that the Bill was a matter of principle—not efficiency, tradition or loyalties—and that its basis was to create local government units capable of good and humane government. None of us could possibly complain about that; that is exactly what we are all here for. I assume that we are all interested in local government. I speak as an ex-Chief Whip. I am assuming that as good parliamentarians we all want that. It is a question whether one method is better than another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To say that because we want local government units capable of good and humane government we must all support this Bill is merely to say, "I, the Minister, like this Bill and would like it accepted". It is not to prove a point. The whole point about the unitary system is that it raised a principle—the principle of the all-purpose authority. One had the all-purpose authority because, granted that there was an element of remoteness here and there, it put all the services within the same authority, making it easier, better and more humane for the ordinary citizen. We are not quarrelling with the words that the Minister uses, but merely on the question whether a principle is involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that he agreed with my hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Mr. Blenkinsop) that people should understand the functions and the way in which they are carried out. Of course he has to agree with it; it is something with which we would all agree. That is what it is all about. The question is whether those functions are better carried out if they all are controlled by one authority, or whether the difference between one set of functions and another is blurred and often confusing to practitioners, let alone ordinary people—and it is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>46</span>
ordinary people with whom we should be concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The mere fact that one says that one disapproves of sin does not mean that one is incapable of committing sin. The fact that the Minister recognises the difficulties and what should be done does not mean that he has carried it out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second part of what he quoted with approval was that people should understand where the functions are carried out. Can we look at the Bill and say that it is more evident to us where those functions will be carried out than it was in the days of the unitary scheme?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can argue, as did the hon. Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack), that the previous Government's changes in Redcliffe-Maud were all concerned with remoteness, and that remoteness is the real argument. The hon. Member said that it was virtually the only argument against, but that it was so strong that it militated against the whole scheme. I can see that—but at least people would have known where those functions were to be carried out. Will they know now?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may be doing the Minister an injustice, but I can visualise he and his colleagues looking at the whole situation of local government, and saying,"We do not like the unitary system. We are to have two tiers, two spheres, two levels; now we must find out what functions to give them. "So a start is made: A will go here, B will go there, C will go there, and D will go somewhere else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned building regulations. I was rather amused by that, because that was one of his second thoughts. I suspect that he was arguing with his colleagues about it, because he has a lot of practical experience. The building regulations situation is a difficult one to decide. Within the framework of the Bill it has finally come to its right home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All these separate functions are confusing. The citizen will not know where to go to obtain the remedies that he requires, and to find out what he wants to know. My hon. Friend the Member for The Hartlepools (Mr. Leadbitter) raised the question of the division in the personal and social services. It is an important point. Where do people go for these necessary and vital services? The Bill as it stands makes it so confusing for people who are in desperate need for these services to know where to go that any suggestion that the unitary system was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0033">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>47</span>
remote—if by that one means remote from the citizen—is totally irrelevant. Somebody in dire trouble has to deal with what is literally a divided area in respect of his most intimate problems. At least under the unitary system he knew where to go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the subject of remoteness my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove (Mr. Terry Davis) made a telling point. He advocated a kind of super-Maud, in the sense of a unitary authority in North Worcestershire. He said that that area would be less remote if it were a unitary authority than it would be either under the present proposals or under Redcliffe-Maud, so there will be occasions when, under a unitary system, it will not be so remote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me take another matter which I am sure the Minister knows, with grim foreboding, will arise again and again. I refer to the question of Plymouth. I do not know whether the Minister will alter the proposals in due course, but it is extraordinary that they should have been put up, with Plymouth governed from a distance of 42 miles. The hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Dame Joan Vickers) makes it 44 miles; no doubt we shall hear from her on the subject on Report. There is indeed a remoteness—one which, under the Labour Government scheme, would not have occurred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to take it as a balance; it is not always so remote. We are really talking about a principle. If we are talking about remoteness as a principle, we come back to the point that unites the whole Committee—we are trying to create a more democratic and more up-to-date system of local government. I go all the way with the Minister and my hon. Friend the Member for South Shields when they talk of its being humane—humane because it is more democratic and more modern. That I fully accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it not time that we thought seriously about what we want to do with local government? When we say that we want it to be more democratic, and we unite and give three hearty cheers for that proposition, do we not really mean that we want greater participation? Otherwise, is it really more democratic? Is it really more democratic to reform local government into larger areas? In the debate on
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>48</span>
the White Paper the Secretary of State was boasting that the number of local authorities was to be radically cut down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In doing that, are we really increasing participation? Do we fully understand what participation in local government means at present, before any reform? Coming from 700 years of history in the case of The Hartlepools, and more recently in London and other areas, here we have a system of local government that is small in size. The hon. Member for Cannock cannot complain about that. It is an argument for no reform at all. Because these areas arc small, there are large numbers of councillors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can any of us, of whatever party, honestly put our hands on our hearts and say that the system at the moment is democratic, and that people participate in it? We all know that they do not. If there is a 40 per cent. vote in a local government election everyone says that it is a high vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is that participation? That is what I mean, and it would be fair to argue against Redcliffe-Maud—just as I believe it is fair to argue against the present Bill, but that may be out of order, Sir Stephen, as we are talking about Redcliffe-Maud—that we have not been given a good democratic system of local government because no provision has been made for real participation. I accept that that is a criticism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cannock spoke of the payment of councillors and so on. I cannot pay too high a tribute to local government officials, who are long-suffering and extremely able—probably the best in the world—but has one not the difficulty with a large authority that the local government officials are hardworking and continuing, professional, and very expert and able, but there may be a leader of a council, who himself is capable, but is prevented by his work from being able to tackle the administration of his area full-time, simply because he is not paid?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what it comes to. The leader of the council is doing the job of prime minister, as it were, of a small territory—an area perhaps larger than many independent States—and yet he cannot afford to Be full-time because he must earn his living. When you have that situation, it follows naturally that the power will reside much more with the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0034">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>49</span>
local government officials than with the elected representatives of the people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not arguing against paying councillors in certain circumstances. I am sure the right hon. Gentleman will follow me there. But I am sure that he would also agree that it would be undesirable for all local councillors to be paid, and ful-time; and that this would be a very real danger with unitary authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was making a slightly different point, but I am with the hon. Member in that I was talking about the leader of a council as the man who ought really to be full-time, and who I do not believe—and this is true of both parties—is on a position of equality, let alone a position of superiority which I believe a democratic process demands, as long as he is unpaid. That was really the point. I was not talking about councillors in general, but about the leader of the council. Since neither a Labour Government nor a Conservative Government have devoted their minds to it, it occurs to me we may have been thinking much more about where power resides than where participation enters in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are concerned about participation, if that is what democracy is about, and I believe it is, the fact that it is an ugly and over-used word does not necessarily detract from its essential meaning. If democracy is participation, if we want all people to play their part as well as they can in governing themselves in what areas they can, we must consider whether there is participation in terms of the unitary area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole point about the community council, which was the lower tier of the unitary authority—which the hon. Member for Cannock described as toothless, in the sense, I suppose, that it could not bite—was that while it might not be able to bite it could yell its head off. And in yelling its head off it could cause much greater interest in what was going on locally than anything that we have at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the debate on the White Paper a number of hon. Members—my hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Mr. Blenkinsop) did, and I did, I know, and I think the Secretary of State did also—mentioned the Golborne Ward experiment in North Kensington. I hap-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>50</span>
pened to have a report of it yesterday, quite by chance, and I find that it has created a considerable amount of interest locally. It has made people aware of what is going on, which they were not before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point is that if in the present system of local government, with its very small units, one cannot obtain this contact between electorate and councillors, it does not necessarily follow that a larger unit cannot get it. Is this not the truth of the matter? The hon. Member for Cannock has his surgery, as I have mine. I touched on it earlier this morning. In my case 80 to 90 per cent. of queries are queries which really ought to be addressed to councillors, and this may well be true in Cannock, too. I gather from certain nods that this is a not unusual experience for hon. Gentlemen opposite.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do we really know the name of our local councillor? Let us be absolutely honest with ourselves. I am not one of those who believe I won the great Borough of Deptford on my own personality—[Hon. Members: "Yes".] I did not lose it on my personality, but it had been Labour for 60 years and it would have taken more than me to lose it. In that compact constituency of, at that time, 49,000 electors, I, being perfectly truthful to this Committee, believe that at most 50 per cent. knew the name of their Member of Parliament. Maybe at the time of the election they knew, but in normal times at the most not more than 50 per cent. knew. I am ready to agree that in the case of many of my hon. Friends the figure is higher—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Much higher.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Much higher in Hull. But, if that is so, what is the percentage of people who know their local councillors? It must be very much lower. So the fact that a unit is smaller does not necessarily mean that there is this real participation in local government. And the fact that it is larger does not mean that it will become worse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The remoteness of which the hon. Gentleman is complaining is a geographical remoteness, not a remoteness as between councillor and electorate. Our task, whatever we may do—whether it is under the unitary system or under the Bill—is to get rid of that sort of remoteness,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0035">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>51</span>
the remoteness between councillors and electorate. I do not believe that it would have been impossible to have done it under the unitary system. Certainly the Redcliffe-Maud proposals were flexible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to consider this point, because if we are to have the Bill it is a problem to which he ought to direct his mind. There may be changes he can make himself as we go along which will meet my point; or at least meet it in part within the context of the Bill. But have we really grasped this particular problem? I do not think we have. In the alternatives—and I am afraid I do look upon them as alternatives—to the Redcliffe-Maud proposals that this Government have instituted, can the Minister honestly say—I know he wants to make local government more democratic, we all do—that apart from getting rid of the geographical remoteness he has got rid of the political remoteness? I do not believe that this is so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that under the unitary system, because one had the toothless, bellyaching council at the bottom, there was a chance of at least creating issues, of making people aware that they had a voice. I suppose that vote and voice are much the same thing; certainly in another place they talk about voices, and in Cabinet one collects voices. They are votes. They mean that people are determining their own destiny.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure the Committee is grateful to the Minister for that information but, in order to forestall any objection in future, I must say that it was not a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If I may just interpose for a moment, I should like to thank the Minister on behalf of this side of the Committee. We do appreciate that he was not being remote. He has responded very readily to a request—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
