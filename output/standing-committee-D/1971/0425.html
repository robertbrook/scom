	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this Amendment we are taking the following:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 4, in page 5, line 15, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"unless he considers that the objection is not relevant to a structure plan or that the points at issue have been dealt with or would be dealt with in the hearing of another objection".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>No. 5, in page 5, line 20, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>(7) If the Secretary of State does not secure to any local planning authority or other person a right to be heard at an examination in public under subsection (3)(	<i>b</i>) above, the person or persons appointed by him for the purpose of holding such an examination in public may nevertheless allow a local planning authority or other person the right to be heard; and this discretion may be exercised at any time before or during the examination in public.</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>No. 6, in page 5, line 20, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>(7A) If the Secretary of State does not permit any part of the structure plan to be examined in public under subsection (3)(	<i>b</i>) above, then the person or persons appointed by him for the purpose of holding such an examination in public may nevertheless allow any matter of the plan to be considered:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Provided that the person or persons appointed deem any such matter to be relevant to the matters affecting in any way those parts of the plan that the Secretary of State considers ought to be examined.</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we had all the time in the world there would, I suppose, be a general feeling of assent in this Com-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>48</span>
mittee that we could have all the participation in the world. That is the problem which we are trying to meet in this Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think every hon. Member favours the idea of the new basis of the structure plan of trying to cut down on the time by making everything to an inquiry as relevant as possible. Nevertheless, we must not destroy participation, and if there is a balance to be struck it should be rather more, though not dogmatically so, on the side of participation than on time. However, in the procedure which we are outlining for the structure plan there is a considerable concession on the question of time. The "We never closed" Windmill attitude on the part of the G.L.D.P. will never be repeated, so to that extent we are gaining.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think my hon. Friend's Amendment, or that proposed by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Handsworth (Mr. Chapman) destroy the time situation to a degree where the new basis of examining our planning procedures will be destroyed. For that reason I feel that the Secretary of State can make what to my mind is a minor yet important concession to participation. What is he being asked to say? That he will hear the relevan local authorities, or any interested bodies, unless he considers that their objection is not relevant to the structure plan. Previously, even if their objection was relevant to a development plan, they had to be heard. That is an important proviso in the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other basis on which he can negative their objections being heard is if the objections can be heard at another inquiry. A local planning inquiry is what is meant. Therefore, he has an overriding power to say "Anything that is not relevant or can be better heard at another inquiry I do not propose to deal with. On the other hand, anything that has relevance to this structure plan not subject to those two provisos, whether by a local authority or by any other body, I ought to hear." I should have thought that that was the right way of tackling this problem, and it is in that spirit that I commend the Amendment to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Allason</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I can agree with the right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin). There is grave danger of the longest running farce
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0479">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>49</span>
being repeated in other parts of the country. A structure plan inquiry is open to individual objectors. If it is possible for an individual to identify his own personal interest in a structure plan, he will undoubtedly seek to object. We will then have a system which in the Greater London Development Plan has proved to be absolutely useless.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think we had better get our terms of reference clear. If one considers my hon. Friend's Amendment, the individual who has an objection which is not really to the structure plan but perhaps to the way in which it may affect him the future may be ruled out of order, because the Minister will say that our proper forum is the local plan and not the structure plan.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allason</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but my worry is that by the time the structure plan has been adopted, the pass has been sold. It will be too late for an objection to the local plan to affect the individual's interest. He may have an estate to the north side of a town, and the structure plan may decide that a by-pass must run to the north side of that town. I do not think that it would be proper for him to object at the structure plan stage to the idea that the by-pass should run to the north of the town, because this is in his private interest rather than in the interests of the community. It may be that at the local plan stage the decision has already been taken for the by-pass to go that way, but his estate may be so large that it is impossible to by-pass it. Therefore, the pass has been sold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some people will lose their rights of objection. I do not think it is possible for us to fob off with the idea that it is all right because at a later stage an individual will have a right of objection. It is in the interests of the community in the long run. Structure plans will have to go through. I am as concerned as anybody about the rights of the individual, but where those rights are so substantial that they overflow into a structure plan, I think they should be overriden in the public interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Derek Walker-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee has had the advantage of hearing the Amendments moved in clear, persuasive and temperate terms. We have also heard
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>50</span>
an extremely helpful analysis by the right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) on the effects of the two Amendments and the differences therein, and also of the proposed procedure in paragraph 28 of the consultation document, to which I draw attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not my wish to detain the Committee for long, and in uttering those ominous words, I hope I do not court the reception that I see from the lively article by Andrew Alexander in today's 	<i>Daily Telegraph</i> relating to an hon. Gentleman in the Chamber when he said he intended to be brief. Apparently all the hon. Members present groaned unanimously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is common ground that the time is ripe for some move from the forensic procedure of inquiry to an examination in public. The compelling reason is the time factor and the clear danger that structure plans might otherwise become out of date in the context of existing circumstances by the time that they are confirmed. It is an abiding danger in town planning that we have seen over the years—rather a case of what Mr. Harold Macmillan called on one occasion "looking up your trains in last year's Bradshaw." What is wanted is the highest common factor, the economy of time and a full examination of the issues with as much public participation as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendments, as I understand them, are directed to that end. The matter falls under several heads: first, the position of individual objectors under new Section 9 (3)(	<i>a</i>) of the 1971 Act, as proposed in the Clause, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. Allason) referred. Secondly, there is the question of those who will participate, and thirdly the question of the issues which are to be listed under the new subsection (3)(	<i>b</i>) in Clause 3 of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a fourth matter which does not arise under the Amendments but which is vital, and to which I should like to refer during the "Clause stand part" debate if the opportunity arises. That is the actual conduct of the public examination which the Committee should know a little more about before we part with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position of individual objectors under the new Section 9 (3)(	<i>a</i>) of the 1971 Act is dealt with in paragraphs 16 to 18 of the consultation document under the heading, "Handling of Objections". In effect, objections under the new proce-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0480">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>51</span>
dure will fall into two categories, a kind of categorisation into sheep and goats—those that make the grade as constituting issues for the examination in public, and those that do not. I believe that we ought to ask my hon. Friend how he envisages that the Secretary of State will fulfil his statutory duty of considering the objections that fall into the latter category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister could also tell us how the consideration of objections which will not be dealt with at the examination—and which will presumably take place behind closed doors and without any impact on the outside world—will phase in with the examination in public of the major issues. Not least, how is it proposed that the Government will convince the unseen and unheard objectors that their objections have had the consideration to which they are entitled under the Statute, and under the terms of natural justice? My hon. Friend needs no reminder of the old maxim about justice being manifestly seen to be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These questions do not appear to be wholly answered in paragraphs 16 to 18 of the consultation document. In view of their importance, I ask for further elucidation. It would be undesirable if an objector were to feel that he was unseen and unheard at the stage of the structure plan, and that at the local plan stage he was faced with a 	<i>res judicata</i> which makes his objection at that stage not meaningful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This matter is important not only in town planning but in the full context of public participation in a democratic society. The Amendments put forward one method—in the case of the Amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Handsworth (Mr. Chapman) it is perhaps a drastic method of dealing with the difficulties, because of the impact of the time factor—but there is no doubt that both Amendments are animated by an acceptance of the inherent difficulties of the present situation, and they underline the desirability of a flexible approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus, the question which arises, in relation to the invitation to participants and the listing of issues, is how full participation and a full canvas of all relevant issues may be ensured without creating, or re-creating, that very delay which the new procedure is aimed at eliminating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe—this will come as no
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>52</span>
surprise to those who have lived with the question of town planning over the years—that there is any perfect solution to these problems. However, I believe that flexibility of approach is desirable, as well as freedom to add both to issues and to participants in appropriate circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here, I think that the proposed approach of the code of practice has significant advantages since, by its very nature, it should prove to be a very flexible instrument—more flexible and more easily amended than if the procedure, as the Amendment seeks to provide, were set out more precisely in an Act of Parliament. With the code of practice, I would hope that the approach to participation and the listing of issues for consideration would be on a "learn-as-you-go" basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Experience in town and country planning over the years has shown that in any event, however much one may seek to write provisions into statutes, there can be no finality; it is a changing scene. I speak as one who has lived with town and country planning Acts since the 1932 Act, when my father, on Second Reading, surprised and, I hope, delighted Members of the day by making a contribution of one-and-a-quarter hours. In case I detect in your eyes, Sir Stephen, a fleeting apprehension, I hasten to assure you that I shall seek to take marginally less time in my contribution to the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, there can be no finality in these questions, which have been subject to constant review and adaptation. Against that background, it may be worth attempting to see whether greater flexibility and a quicker response to changing circumstances and newly identified needs may not be achieved by means of the code of practice. I believe it is worth a trial, although only on the basis of a reasonably open-minded approach with regard to the admission of participants and the listing of issues with a view to meeting at any rate to a great extent the spirit, if not the letter, of the Amendments moved by both sides of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, I wish to refer to the position of agriculture. In this connection, my hon. Friend the Member for Hands-worth during our last Sitting read an extract from a letter which he had received, which is reproduced in columns 39-40 of the proceedings of 20th April. Of course, that extract includes references to the actual conduct of the examination
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0481">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>53</span>
in public which I apprehend, Sir Stephen, is probably more appropriate to the debate on the Question "That the Clause stand part."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of participation and the listing of issues to which the Amendments relate, I have had the advantage of a discussion with representatives of the National Farmers' Union, whose point of view I am always anxious to understand since there is a certain amount of agriculture and a good deal of horticulture in my constituency. Putting it shortly, they are puzzled by the omission of any reference at all to agricultural aspects, particularly in paragraph 12 of the consultation document which sets out the kind of matters likely to be of such concern as to be listed as issues in structure plans. They would welcome an assurance that the voice of agriculture will normally be heard in structure plans, except of course where they are concerned with wholly urban areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That does not seem unreasonable when one has regard to the amount of land which is in agricultural use and to the real difference it can make to agriculture, not to individual agriculturists who might be heard in the context of a local plan but to the whole future of agriculture in a locality which may be decisively affected by the pattern of structure planning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that when my hon. Friend replies to the debate, or perhaps later in the "Clause stand part" debate, if he thinks it more appropriate, he will take account of the not unnatural apprehensions they have voiced and give the measure of reassurance which they anxiously await. I hope also that he will be able to indicate a liberal approach in the code of practice if he does not propose to accept the Amendments and will recognise that there is justice in the observations made on the last occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the right hon. and learned Gentleman will forgive me. I wanted to avoid the old cliché of "before he sits down" when he has, in fact, sat down. As I understand it, he has considerable sympathy with the spirit of all the Amendments in what they seek to do and the balance they are trying to create. Basically, he seems to be saying that he is not certain that the Statute is the place in which to put these doubts
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>54</span>
but that they should be resolved in the code of practice. I think that is how he put his case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is so, of course it applies the other way round and subsection (5) itself ought not to be in. It may well be true that the Amendments are underlining the statutory force, but the regulations or the code of practice could themselves say that the Secretary of State will take into account objections in the way we have phrased the Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir D. Walker-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has raised a specific point about subsection (5). It is not for me to explain the reasons which led to its inclusion in this particular pattern. I imagine, however, that it is included as a kind of preliminary defence against a writ of 	<i>mandamus</i> or the like which some enterprising objector might otherwise be disposed to initiate against the Minister to compel a right to be heard. The easiest and speediest defence against such an action is, of course, to be able to cite the specific words of the Statute. Nobody has told me why the provision is there, but that seems to be a sensible reason for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the wider point raised by the right hon. Gentleman, as I have previously indicated, the spirit of the Amendments is well conceived. They are trying to achieve something that is difficult—the highest common factor of what are conflicting considerations; the economy of time on the one hand, and the fullest public participation on the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not being dogmatic. In the ordinary way I prefer to see things written firmly in the Statute, but in the full context of this specific case it is worth making a try to the approach which I understand is the Minister's approach, of seeking, so far as possible, to achieve the greatest flexibility in a code of practice which will take as its object the reconciliation of these two somewhat opposing factors. If I am right, we could get what the Committee wishes by a code of practice, always provided that it is not one written in tablets of stone, but can be amended, adapted and improved as we go along.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Blenkinsop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems that some of the anxieties expressed to me could be met by one set or other of the Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly there are anxieties lest objec-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0482">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>55</span>
tions may be regarded as not suitable to be taken at the examination and may consequently fall into a kind of limbo between the examination and the local plan. For example, it might be held that the objection, when it came to the local plan, was the kind of matter that should have been dealt with at the examination. There is a quite understandable fear in the minds of some people that that could happen, and, although it could be argued that the objections could be put in writing, that is not wholly satisfactory. Therefore, some form of guarantee or assurance is required.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Development (Mr. Graham Page)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with the Amendments one by one, except that I will take Amendments 3 and 4 together, and then go on to pick up observations which have been made by right hon. and hon. Gentlemen during the course of debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 go to the root of the proposed procedure. Their effect would be to secure to every objector—I stress the word "objector" because it is not the objector with whom we are really concerned in this new procedure—a right to be heard, except where the Secretary of State considers either that an objection is not relevant to a structure plan or that the points at issue in an objection are dealt with in another objection which is to be heard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On that basis, these Amendments would effectively restore the traditional public inquiry. We should be looking at objections rather than representations. We should be going back to a form of litigation, rather than a form of discussion. As the Government have argued throughout Second Reading and in another place, an inquiry is not the most appropriate method. What we want from this new procedure is the most appropriate method for the Secretary of State to inform himself on the key issues which he needs to consider in public in forming a view on a structure plan. We felt that an inquiry hearing objections was not the best way in which the Secretary of State could so inform himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.00 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the drafting of subsection (3) was quite deliberate. Paragraphs (	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>) separate the two elements of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>56</span>
Secretary of State's consideration of the structure plan. First, the Secretary of State remains under the statutory obligation to consider all objections to the plan. The consultation document makes clear our intention to provide every possible means of ensuring that objections will be made in writing, and to a degree of detail which precludes the possibility of any doubt existing in the mind of the Secretary of State as to the purpose of the objection. On receiving an objection, the Secretary of State will be bound by statute to consider it, and to discover the real basis behind it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to refer to the point raised by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, East (Sir D. Walker-Smith). The objections of those who do not make the grade as objectors or who do not make the grade as representatives at the discussions will be considered at the local plan stage. This is really what the Secretary of State has to decide. When he receives an objection he has to decide whether it is an objection on which a discussion could rightly be based on a strategy shown in the structure plan, or whether it is an objection which is more detailed and would be better dealt with on the local plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an obligation for all objections to be considered on the local plan. That is contained in Section 13 of the 1971 Act. If they are of the type designated in the regulations, a public inquiry should be held about those objections. The objection will be moved one stage further along the procedure if it does not qualify for discussion on the structure plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I also deal with the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. Allason). He gave an example of a by-pass going through an estate because the structure plan chose to put the by-pass to the north instead of to the south of the town. I should have thought that that should be a matter for discussion in the structure plan. A by-pass or a through relief road to a town is one of the major strategies of planning of an area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, it will be for the Secretary of State to reach a decision on this question. My hon. Friend the Member for Handsworth, during our last sitting, raised that point in very potent terms, when he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"…as Clause 3 now stands, it puts the Sec-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0483">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>57</span>
retary of State in an invidious position. For example, he might have to decide whether to give the right to one amenity association to appear at a public examination of a structure plan but not to another."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee D;</i> 20th April, 1972, col. 40.]</p></blockquote>
I readily agree that this is at the basis of our new procedure, and that it is the very heavy responsibility of the Secretary of State to choose the issues and the participants in the structure plan. In so doing, he must ensure that he is not depriving anyone of the right to their objection to the plan being heard and that, if such persons do not qualify for hearing during the proceedings of the public examination of the structure plan, they will be afforded a later opportunity. They should not be deprived of such later opportunity through any 	<i>fait accompli</i> in the structure plan when it is approved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So much for the obligation to consider objections. The second of the statutory obligations, imposed by subsection (3)(	<i>b</i>), relates to the holding of the examination in public, and of
	<br><blockquote><p>"…such matters affecting his consideration of the plan as he considers ought to be so examined."</p></blockquote>
The obligation is placed fairly and squarely under the Secretary of State, and, by law, it will be those matters which he considers ought to be examined. In reaching such a decision he may well be assisted by the chairman of the panel and by the panel itself. When the issue approaches the hearing stage, at which time, as my hon. Friend pointed out at our last sitting, points which previously appeared not to be controversial may suddenly become so, the panel may well prove to be the appropriate source of advice to the Secretary of State. As the consultation document indicates, it might be proper for the Secretary of State at that point—at the approach of or during the course of the hearing—to delegate to the panel his powers of consideration whether or not a matter is relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the panel should be afforded such flexibility when taking such examination in public. According to the provisions of paragraph 28 of the consultation document, if an unforeseen point arises the panel should be able to decide whether it was a point which the Secretary of State would have included as a matter for consideration in the examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>58</span>
An important aspect of the Government's proposals is that the detailed procedures for conducting these examinations, including the selection of participants, will be set out in the code which we have already discussed during debates in our proceedings. The consultation document set out fairly comprehensively the shape of the code which we have in mind. It suggests ways of safeguarding the position of objectors not selected as participants, including those who consider that their own objection raises a matter of importance which should be selected, and those who consider that their objection raises a particular aspect of selected matter which is unlikely to be adequately discussed by those who have been selected as participants. All those questions may be raised and considered in the selection of the issues and of participants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principal suggestion is that there could be an opportunity for objectors to make written representations to the Secretary of State within a specified time concerning the selected list of issues or participants, or, alternatively, that the written representation may be made, again possibly within a time limit, to the chairman of the panel. These are matters upon which we are gathering opinion at the moment, and I can assure the Committee that we are achieving good and constructive results from the consultation document. We shall take into account the debates in both Houses and the debate now proceeding in the Committee. All these matters will be taken into consideration in drawing the code. From the constructive help we are obtaining at the moment, I think we are likely to produce a good and practical code.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend yesterday and my right hon. and learned Friend today raised the question of agriculture being one of the factors for consideration in this examination in public of a structure plan. The letter from the National Farmers' Union has been quoted. I felt that it went rather far in asking for an assurance. The letter read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"All we are anxious to achieve is a firm assurance by Government that wherever agriculture is a factor in structure plans, there will be an opportunity for its representatives to probe, challenge and cross-examine meaningfully."</p></blockquote>
I think that goes a little far because it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0484">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>59</span>
asks for an assurance
	<br><blockquote><p>"wherever agriculture is a factor".</p></blockquote>
If it is a factor which is material to the consideration of the structure plan, it would come within those listed in paragraph 12 of the consultation document, the kind of things which we see at the moment as "key strategic elements" in the plan. There is no doubt at all that if agriculture were a material factor—I think that "material" is the only word I would wish to add to what is said in the letter—in the consideration of the structure plan, we would hope that those representing agriculture nationally or at least regionally, or in the locality as a whole, would be willing to take part in the examination in public of the plan. I should have thought that the National Farmers' Union would be anxious to see that a representative was there at an examination of this kind to put the overall view of agriculture or horticulture, whichever it may be, and that it is not left solely to the objector whose farm may be affected by the strategy shown in the plan. I think that that indicates the kind of discussion we hope will occur from this examination—not merely the hearing of objections but the consideration of the plan in its wide aspects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to Amendments Nos. 5 and 6, the effect of Amendment No. 5 would be to give the panel holding the examination in public the power to decide who should be heard at the examination. The Bill contains no specific provision about the process or machinery for selecting participants at the examination other than the new subsection (5) of Section 9 of the 1971 Act which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State shall not be required to secure to any local planning authority or other person a right to be heard at any examination …".</p></blockquote>
It has already been pointed out that this is perhaps the one exception, where a procedural matter is included in the Bill rather than left to the code. The matter would need to be developed in the code, but, as my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, East foresaw, certain basic legal protection for the Secretary of State should be provided to ensure that the structure plan examination started. We might overcome legal action which might delay the holding of the examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>60</span>
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have put out a fairly detailed outline of the proposed examination procedure. As the consultation document has had a wide circulation, and the code of practice, before we reach a final draft, will also be widely circulated, I believe that we can safely leave to the code the matters referred to in Amendment No. 5.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consultation document was concerned to show that we appreciate the misgivings which are bound to be felt at this stage, at the start of a new procedure. The document suggests a possible opportunity for those who consider that they should participate in the examination, to put their case for being selected, through the Secretary of State. It provides for associating the chairman of the panel with the final selection of participants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Arrangements on these lines would achieve much the same purpose as Amendment No. 5, although the consultation document goes perhaps a little further. In paragraph 28 it provides for the chairman, within broad procedures laid down in the code of practice, to have a wide power of discretion. Therefore, he would determine the broad programme of the sessions of the examination. The document also suggests that the chairman might have a final discretion, on behalf of the Secretary of State, to admit additional participations provided that the grounds for doing so had not been advanced at an earlier stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not asking the chairman to go over again what the Secretary of State has already decided. But if a matter is raised which could not reasonably have been advanced earlier, the chairman should assist in deciding whether that is a structure plan matter. If anything was raised during the course of the examination we should expect the chairman and his panel to come to a decision as a matter of the normal running of the examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The examination is a new procedure, as is the structure plan itself which came in in 1968. We do not, therefore, know the best procedure for examining such structure plans. We believe that we have the right procedure in the Bill, in the form more of a seminar than litigation. We hope that it will work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Committee to leave it to a flexible code to start with, without picking out certain points and putting them into the Bill at this stage. My Department will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0485">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>61</span>
keep in close touch with Members of Parliament concerned with the matter, with local authority associations, and with professional bodies, and will seek advice and help in producing the code and eventually converting it into regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the Second Reading I emphasised that the Bill made no detailed provisions relating to public examination, that the new procedure would be evolved in consultation with those concerned, particularly with the Council on Tribunals, and that we wanted to find the best procedure to put into regulations eventually. In welcoming those proposals, the right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) asked me to keep the position constantly under review. I said that I would do so, and I give that assurance again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not feel that the working out of the procedure is a matter which must be decided once and for all, even when we lay down the code. It would clearly be much harder to follow through this approach if the specific provision contained in the Amendment or in Amendment No. 6 were built into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. and learned Friend said that there were three factors. He then added a fourth with which we can deal later. There are three vital factors in the procedure. First, the Secretary of State has the continuing statutory duty to consider all objections to the structure plan; secondly, if the point of any objection is in doubt, the objector will be asked to expand it in a further written submission so that the participants can then be selected; thirdly, the examination is concerned with issues, not with objections as such. It will need to be a balanced discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I would hope that we would not only have objectors taking part, but also those who supported the plan. I hope that we shall look for those who support the strategy of the plan or are constructively critical of it. There I come back again to the National Farmers' Union. On the occasions on which it joins in these examinations I hope that it will come with constructive considerations and criticisms as well as with objections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend's Amendment No. 6 is, again, unacceptable to me on the same grounds. I should not wish to put it into the Bill but it is a valuable suggestion towards the code. The effect of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>62</span>
Amendment would be to give the panel the right to make the final decision about the matters to be examined. This right is made subject to the proviso in the Amendment that any matters added by the panel must be relevant to those parts of the structure plan that the Secretary of State considers should be examined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that that would be too restrictive on the panel. The Bill provides for an examination in public of such matters as the Secretary of State considers ought to be examined. It is clearly the intention of the Amendment, with that proviso, that the panel should be enabled to extend somewhat the scope of that examination, but the proviso restricts it to those parts of the plan—and I am not very happy about the words "parts of the plan"—that the Secretary of State considers should be examined. It may well be that during the course of the examination a material issue will arise which the Secretary of State had not considered. Indeed, my hon. Friend said so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the consultation document it is suggested that the chairman should have discretion to admit additional unforeseen issues which could not have been raised at an earlier stage, whereas the Amendment would limit the chairman's powers to widen the scope of discussion on an already specified issue. There may be issues not yet specified. It may not be just a matter of widening discussion on an issue. We may wish the chairman of the panel to take into account new issues arising during examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A lot depends on the quality of the chairman, because during the course of examination responsibility is passed to him from the Secretary of State. I am sure we shall select a chairman who, while picking out the issues, will not extend an examination of this kind to what has been called the "Windmill Theatre" and the "Longest running farce in town". In the G.L.D.P. examination a chairman would be bound by existing law. It is that type of inquiry which we now wish to replace by the public examination described in the consultation document.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

approached the problem in a very sensible way, Indeed he displayed some of that flexibility when dealing with paragraph 28. I do not know whether it was noticed by the Committee but he slipped in one or two "reasonables" which do not appear in paragraph 28—he had better look at HANSARD tomorrow. I was delighted that that was so.

We will, none of us, see the code of practice as it will eventually emerge after discussions with various professions, learned societies and ourselves. By that time it will be a code of practice, and while the Minister will keep an eye on it we in this Committee will not be able to do so. When the regulations are published I assume the House will have an opportunity to consider them and then decide whether or not they are satisfactory in total, but it will not be able to amend them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 28 does not go further than the Amendments of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Handsworth. Still less does it go further than the Amendments of my hon. Friend. Paragraph 28 discretion is narrow. I have a feeling that the right hon. and learned Gentleman, had this not been in the regulations and since it is not in the Bill, might have given us an interesting dissertation on whether a writ of 	<i>mandamus</i> might have arisen in the case of an issue which was not foreseen. Someone affected by such an issue, whether wishing to support or oppose it, might say, "I want to be heard at the inquiry." If the Secretary of State said that he had no power to do it, there might be a court action to impose those rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If on this I say, "Thank you for nothing" to the Minister. I am not being insulting. I am merely saying that he is, quite rightly, protecting the law as I understand it. I appreciate from what he
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>64</span>
said that he wanted to go further than that. All that he is doing is to see that what might be a reason for subsection (5) was carried forward to issues that could not be foreseen. It is different from the concept and philosophy of saying, "Let people object, if they wish, unless there are good reasons why they should not object."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the Minister does not take it too hard that one uses the word "object". After all, when something is proposed there are those who take a contrary view. I do not know any other word that better fits than "object". It does not necessarily mean that people are objecting—as the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead thought—because they have private or personal interests. They may wish to put a contrary point of view on strict planning grounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why the hon. Member for Birmingham, Handsworth (Mr. Chapman) specifically put in local authorities, on the grounds that they might not have a particular axe to grind but might have a philosophical point to put across. I do not think that paragraph 28 of the consultation document meets the point. The Minister did not think so, because he congratulated his hon. Friend and said that he would take Amendment No. 5 into account in the code of practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the major point, about procedure for this Committee. I suggest to my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Gorton (Mr. Marks) that he presses his Amendment to a Division. I do not want to embarrass the Minister—we are on the same side about this—but I believe that a point of view ought to be strongly expressed by the Committee on the point, to show that we believe that participation ought not to be thrown out of the window.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I was endeavouring to present was that the chairman of the panel should not act as a court of appeal from the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State would decide the issues. It would be wrong for the chairman to say: "The Secretary of State is wrong. I think that there ought not be that issue, there ought to be this one."

Amendment in which he gives the theoretical power to the Secretary of State. In practice, the chairman would say to the Department, "Issues have arisen. We think they ought to be considered". And the Secretary of State would agree. Perhaps the Secretary of State ought not even to act as an appellate judge from the chairman of the panel. The other way round should certainly not occur. This is an occasion when a Division without any malice or politically-motivated purpose might be an advantage. I feel strongly about this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Marks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the fact that the Government are trying to separate individual objections from the broad consideration of issues on the structure plan. It is significant that in subsection (5), which I seek to amend, there is no mention of the word "objectors" or "objections". The trouble with the subsection is that it can also prevent the public discussion of ideas, counterproposals and alternatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State will decide the issues, what should be examined and who should take part in the discussions. There is some concern that the arguments put forward at the examination will not be recorded. Paragraph 34 of the consultation document states:—
	<br><blockquote><p>"The report would be drafted in terms of an assessment of the issues and not as an account of the arguments advanced by particular participants. In particular it would not deal with the merits of particular objections, even where their subject matter had been covered at the examination. The panel's report could however be a basis on which the Secretary of State reached a conclusion on the weight to be attached to an objection."</p></blockquote>
There is considerable concern about the subsection, among individuals, planning authorities and planning officers. The subsection refers to local planning authorities and gives the Secretary of State power to exclude them as well—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>even the authority which prepared the structure plan.</p>
	<p>I have received a letter from the Urban District Councils Association, which points out that in its view the Bill raised a
	<br><blockquote><p>"… constitutional issue of some importance."</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>It goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The crux of the matter is contained in subclause (5) of Clause 3. This provides 'that the Secretary of State shall not be required to secure to any local planning authority or other person a right to be heard at any examination …' As worded, this would even empower the Secretary of State to refuse the local planning authority which had prepared the structure plan under consideration the right to participate at the examination in public! It seems scarcely conceivable that he would seek to do so, but if this is not the intention the pertinent question could be asked: Why has such a power been included in the Bill? We are at a loss to understand why this power should be written into the Bill. Such a body should automatically be entitled to be present at examinations in public, as should district councils. As regards this latter type of body there is indeed even more reason why this should be so in view of the responsibilities for local plan making which they are to have under the Local Government Bill. Perhaps the answer is that the Government did not want to be seen as favouring one class of 'person' as against another, but 'county planning authorities' and 'district planning authorities' because of their planning responsibilities, and as custodians of the public interest, are in a class of their own. There seems to us to be an unanswerable case for their being entitled to be heard, as of right, at examinations in public."</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>There is a great deal of concern about this subsection, and among the public a great deal of suspicion about town planners and town planning. Anything the Committee can do to ease that concern and to dispel that suspicion, should be done. I believe that my Amendment would help to do that.</p>

We do not see the purpose of subsection (7). If its purpose is what it appears to be, it is in contradiction to the main theme of the Clause which requires the Secretary of State to consider a plan and to consider an objection. Subsection (7) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"On considering a structure plan the Secretary of State may consult with, or consider the views of, any local planning authority or other person"—</p></blockquote>

	<p>That is what the Bill is about, that the Secretary of State shall take into consideration the views of participants in a planning inquiry. As my hon.

This provision has always been used in connection with modifications of a development plan that the Secretary of State proposes to make. For example, it is often necessary to follow through a proposed modification by making minor consequential modifications, either in the written statement to a development plan or to the map itself. It is a necessary power to give to the Secretary of State so as to avoid nonsense in a development plan. It has been exercised at the stage before a final decision is taken on what modifications to propose, and it does not prejudice the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practice I have found this provision of great use in dealing with minor problems on a development plan. It would be disastrous if we did not carry it forward into the present structure plan procedure. There may be matters which the Secretary of State wishes to clear up with a local planning authority or with anyone who has made representations during the course of an examination in public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are three points. First, the Secretary of State should be entitled to consult anyone he chooses. Secondly, he should not be obliged to consult anyone he does not choose to consult. For example, he could make minor amendments to the structure plan without going back to the local planning authority. Thirdly, he does not need to re-open an inquiry if he makes minor amendments of that kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is purely a provision without any bad motive. It is one that has worked well for a long time. It has stood the test of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>70</span>
time, and it would be a great pity if we left it out of this new procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 8, in page 5, line 24, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>() On exercising his powers under subsection (1) of this section in relation to any structure plan, the Secretary of State shall give such statement as he considers appropriate of the reasons governing his decision.</p></blockquote>
The Amendment requires the Secretary of State to include a statement of general reasons in his decision letter on a structure plan. I do not suppose anyone would ever think that the Secretary of State would not give reasons. Indeed, it has always been his intention that his decision should be given in the form of a reasoned decision letter. The general statutory requirement as to the giving of reasons on request following an inquiry is contained in the Tribunals and Inquiries Act, 1971.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the examination in public proposed in the Bill is not an inquiry which falls wholly within that Act. Since the examination in public is breaking new ground in relation to a new form of plan, the structure plan, it is not really appropriate that the Tribunals and Inquiries Act, 1971 should apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Section 3(6), that Act is applied to a limited extent in giving the Council on Tribunals its normal general oversight of procedures. The Council on Tribunals has represented to me that a specific statutory provision as to the giving of reasons on a decision on a structure plan is needed in the Bill. I have accepted that view and that is the reason for tabling the Amendment. It places upon the Secretary of State an obligation to give reasons, but I did not wish to place that obligation so heavily that he would have to give reasons for every item in the structure plan. There is therefore the statement that it should be only "as he considers appropriate" to the examination and study of the plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are real difficulties about imposing any further statutory obligation upon the Secretary of State, that is to say, to give his reasons for decisions on the plan, which would mean on every part and detail of the plan. The nature of a structure plan and the process which leads to a decision and the choices open to the Secretary of State in dealing with the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0490">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>71</span>
proposals before him combine to make it inappropriate to require him to give reasons other than in general terms. It is, of course, his intention to give them in those general terms, and the Amendment would confirm that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State's final decision on the proposals will be to approve the plan in whole or in part, with or without modifications or reservations, or possibly to reject it. That decision will be based not only on consideration of objections made to the proposals and consideration of matters examined at the examination in public, but also on consideration of various questions of policy. The structure plan itself will be a complex interrelation of policies and proposals, and the decision is expected to be a decision on the plan as a whole. I think the Amendment sufficiently gives the assurance that the Secretary of State's intention is to state his reasons for a decision on a structure plan whilst relieving him of giving a long decision letter on every detail in the plan.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We welcome this addition to the Bill which spells out that the Secretary of State shall give his reasons for his decision, or such reasons as he considers appropriate. Like the Minister, I think everyone in the Committee took it for granted that in an inquiry of this kind the Secretary of State would give his reasons when arriving at his decision. Nevertheless, the view of the Council on Tribunals that the Amendment is necessary is to be welcomed as well, because the Bill itself will spell out the need for the Secretary of State to give his reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we consider planning inquiries of this kind—although it is not an inquiry now in the old sense of a public inquiry—in this sensitive area of structure plans where different views are advanced to the Minister and to the tribunal, it always helps the participant to know that it is spelt in the Act, that the Minister cannot merely say "yea" or "nay" but must exercise his judicial powers, to give reasons to all people, or such reasons as are appropriate—I do not think that we would want him to dot the every "i" and cross every "t" in his reasons—and at least give his general view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not quite clear about one point of drafting. The new subsection will appear at line 24. It refers to the Secre-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>72</span>
tary of State
	<br><blockquote><p>"On exercising his powers under subsection (1) of this section".</p></blockquote>
The Clause is drafted as legislation by reference, and refers to the 1971 Act. I take it that the subsection referred to means subsection (1) of the appropriate Section of the 1971 Act. Otherwise it does not fall in line with the rest of the subsections on that page.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will certainly be looking into the drafting on that point to make quite clear what it means. I am advised that it means subsection (1) of Section 9 of the 1971 Act. That is what it is intended to do, but I will look at it to make sure that it really does. I think it probably depends upon where one puts the inverted commas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At this stage I should have had no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that the general principles of Clause 3 had been adequately discussed upon the Amendments thereto. However, several Members of the Committee indicated that they had curtailed their remarks in order to raise matters in the "Clause stand part" debate, and it would be unfair of me to deprive them of that privilege.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed</i>, That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir D. Walker-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I trust that I shall not be backward in taking the hint which you have delicately conveyed to the Committee, Sir Stephen, but, as you observed with your characteristic fairness and acumen, some of us indicated that there were points which we wished to raise in the "Clause stand part" debate—one, at any rate, in my own case, which I felt would not strictly speaking have been in order in the discussion of the Amendments. That is the fourth matter to which I referred when dealing with the Amendments, namely the conduct of the proceedings in the examination in public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once we have got it right, if we do get it right, the question of who shall participate and what issues will be listed for consideration in the examination in public, there still remains a very important problem with regard to the actual conduct of the proceedings. I say "a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0491">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>73</span>
problem" because, by the provisions of Clause 3, we are venturing into the unknown in the sense that we are making the leap from our traditional procedures in these matters, which are of a forensic or 	<i>quasi</i> judicial character, to proceedings in the nature of a seminar. Having had a little experience of these matters, I think that it is certainly worth a try to see whether the seminar approach will serve us better, at any rate in the context of structure plans which are themselves a relatively new innovation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

I say that with one important proviso. In the examination in public there must be some mechanism for the elucidation of fact. If town planning is to be meaningful, it must proceed on a basis of fact and must not merely be an exchange of opinion by people, however learned they may be in these matters. For this purpose some evidential procedures are normally found to be necessary. We know that from the House of Commons itself. The House of Commons rightly has a high reputation in the discussion of matters arising out of opinion, but it is eminently not a forum—if I may respecfully say so—for deciding questions of disputed fact. Here I am talking about the Public Bill procedures and the public debates of the House of Commons, not the Private Bill procedures. These are in a category of their own and reinforce my point because, in that, Parliament itself has found it necessary, where fact is important, to add certain forensic or 	<i>quasi</i> forensic procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the establishment of fact there is no doubt that the mechanism of cross-examination is a most useful machinery both for testing and elucidating. I have noticed with some interest that twice in successive paragraphs dealing with the proceedings in the consultation document, the word "probing" is used. Paragraph 29 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The essential feature of the examination would be that of a probing discussion between the Panel, and the planning authority and other participants."</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 30 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Panel would concentrate on probing the reasonableness of the proposals …"</p></blockquote>
It is this probing operation which is, to some extent, the heart of the matter. In
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>74</span>
the examination in public the sole probers will be the panel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to refer briefly to two proceedings in both of which I was professionally concerned—the Roskill inquiry and the G.L.D.P. inquiry, which has been mentioned today. The probing exercise was a two-pronged operation. It was conducted by the commission and the panel in the respective proceedings but it was also done by a large array of counsel briefed on behalf of the respective parties. There is no doubt that both those proceedings gained from these processes of cross-examination. For example, in the Roskill inquiry all examination-in-chief was eliminated because all proofs were put in in written form and also, from time to time, the learned judge requested the learned economists and professors to adjourn outside to see whether they could establish some measure of agreement on some particularly intractible or esoteric point, thereby to some extent combining the virtues of a forensic proceeding and a seminar. It may be that that has something to teach us in this regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again in the G.L.D.P. inquiry, the cross-examination, not only by counsel but by the panel, of some of the documents submitted, not least by the planning authority, brought a marked degree of elucidation to things which were perhaps not clear beyond a peradventure in the form in which they were submitted. These are tasks which will have to be undertaken by these panels if this seminar approach is to be meaningful and is to achieve the results required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
[MR. DRAYSON 	<i>in the Chair</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with what my right hon. Friend has said. It postulates a high quality of panel chairmanship and membership. The examination in public and the seminar approach cannot succeed without that. Both the Roskill inquiry and the G.L.D.P. inquiry had the advantage of exceptionally able chairmanship and membership of the panel. I found it most interesting and deemed it a privilege to hear the commission and the panel in these proceedings conducting their own cross-examinations, if that be the word. That of itself is an encouraging portent for the success of the examination in public, provided only that the chairman and panel can be of a high quality, able to probe these matters—to use the language of the consultative docu-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0492">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>75</span>
ment—to establish the basis of fact and then to make the assessment of opinion upon that basis of fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, therefore, that my hon. Friend will give consideration to the question of the conduct of the examinations in public. The points that I am making about probing and cross-examination are points which are echoed in the letter from the National Farmers' Union to which he referred earlier and to which my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Handsworth (Mr. Chapman) referred on 20th April.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude by saying that I think that it is right to give this examination in public, this seminar-type technique, a chance. It can succeed if these safeguards are introduced into the procedure for the elucidation of fact and the testing of opinion. I hope it will succeed, and I wish it well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blenkinsop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all listen with a great deal of respect to the right hon. and learned Member for Hertfordshire, East (Sir D. Walker-Smith). He will not be surprised that in this field, as a layman, I emphasise the necessity for the seminar approach and appreciate some of the dangers of too rigorous a legal battle or legal cross-examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much experience has been gained—indeed, I think that the Bill has emerged as a result of that experience—through the working out of the Greater London Development Plan, and through the inquiry which has been, and is being carried out thereon. It must be said that if one wishes people to put important points of view—contrasting points of view, which, while intended to be helpful and constructive, may fundamentally challenge some of the basic concepts of a set of proposals, whether from the Greater London or from other authorities—the full scale of legal cross-examination is not necessarily the most appropriate means. It can be very damaging and difficult, and the atmosphere can be so geared to legal thinking that it is almost impossible to encourage eminent, thoughtful and useful minds to give of their best.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Minister wishes to enlist co-operation in obtaining a flow of ideas without anyone feeling so far committed that he is fighting for the vital necessity of his job, or to preserve some established position. We seek a freer flow of ideas. That is the great merit of the examination
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>76</span>
procedure. For those reasons, I would tip the scales strongly in favour of the seminar or conference approach. Equally, I appreciate the absolute necessity for probing evidence, and for producing accurate and effective information. It is necessary to maintain an effective balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further point of importance is that the concept of the examination, as provided for in the Clause, is workable only if we presuppose that a great deal of information has been made available in advance which follows from participation at an even earlier stage. I do not mean that such a concept should necessarily be formalised, but rather that such development of ideas can be useful only if those concerned with planning are able to obtain information much more readily than in the past. This in turn presupposes that no one adopts an absolutely fixed position at that stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A point of concern arises in that connection. It is clear, both from the consultation papers and from the Minister's comments, that it is intended, at the stage of the examination, that the authority concerned will put forward its approved proposals. I can appreciate the necessity for this procedure. Nevertheless, I hope that it will not rule out the presentation of any alternatives which may have been considered. I should not wish—I hope that the Minister will agree with me—an authority to submit its preferred proposals in such a form as to preclude any ideas put forward at the examination from being of any real value. I hope that the examination will take place in a considerably more fluid setting. Thus, while appreciating the value of submitting a preferred solution, I hope that it will not be submitted as a final draft but that other proposals that may have been under discussion will be available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope therefore that the hon. Gentleman will indicate his acceptance of the concept—as I think is implicit in the consultation document—that there will be many means by which those concerned will be able to obtain considerable prior information, so that the examination will form only one stage of a whole series of procedures that will gradually evolve in the new process of participation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Committee has been using the word "seminar" too
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0493">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>77</span>
freely. The Bill refers to an examination in public—an examination of the structure plan which is put forward. It is true that discussion of the plan is to take place, so that it is to that extent "seminary". However, it should be remembered that it is nevertheless an examination of something put forward as strategy over a wide area—over one county, or possibly more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With reference to the last point raised by the hon. Member for South Shields (Mr. Blenkinsop), we must not baulk at the fact that the proposal in question will be the preferred proposal by the local planning authority which has submitted it. It should be remembered that it will at that stage have undergone the process of public participation, following publication of the survey, the report on the survey, and the draft plan, and that the latter will have been adequately discussed in the neighbourhood to which it applies. To that extent, it comes forward as a firm proposal by the local planning authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At that stage, therefore, the Secretary of State appoints a chairman and panel to examine the proposal, not only on the surface but in depth, to see whether the principles on which it is based are right, or whether the prejudices and biases which may underlie it are justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the course of examination it will be necessary, as my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, East (Sir D. Walker-Smith) pointed out, to elucidate the facts, and there must be some means of ensuring that these facts come to light. The Roskill Commission provided the rather novel way of establishing facts outside the examination. This is a useful idea, and one which we had in mind in the last sentence of paragraph 29 of the consultation document, which states that by means of asking the experts to undertake consideration with a view to achieving agreed facts
	<br><blockquote><p>"… elucidations of matters of fact could be carried on without holding up the examination itself."</p></blockquote>
Nevertheless, however much one tries to hive off this means of achieving evidence, whether to small committees to consider one item or to experts to report back with agreed facts, it will be necessary for someone to undertake an evidential or examination procedure in the course of the examination itself. Whether one leaves that entirely to the chairman and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>78</span>
the panel, or has legal representation for those appearing, must depend on the way in which the examination progresses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assume that the chairman and his panel will hold a preliminary meeting to decide what information they will require. In the examination we shall not be considering proprietary rights, as in the traditional form of inquiry. Instead, we shall be considering opinions, based on fact, brought out in a proper form of examination. One party or the other may wish to be legally represented, both for the presentation of its point of view and for probing facts and assumptions produced by other people appearing at the examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I hope that we shall break away from a form of inquiry which probes the rights of individuals, or even the rights of small sections of the public. Because we shall be considering the overall strategy for an area, evidence must be based on fact, and whoever produces that fact must be cross-examined. In many cases the chairman and panel will feel that they can probe sufficiently with the assistance of experts bringing up agreed statements. After one or two examinations have taken place the public will see that there is no necessity, as in the normal form of inquiry, for the parties to be represented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In no way is the Bar to be prevented from giving its help, as it has always done in inquiries, but there will not be the same necessity for the type of cross-examination which has taken place during a traditional inquiry. Once cross-examination has probed the facts, it will be much more of an "across the table" discussion with the panel requiring the local planning authority to justify what has been put in the plan, and for others to put forward constructive or destructive proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After we have had the precedent of one or two examinations it will be seen that it is a real break away from the traditional form of examination-in-chief, cross-examination and re-examination on some specific proprietary interest. This examination is a discussion of strategy, and to that extent legal representation may be of great value in putting an opinion in a succinct or powerful way. It is not intended that there should be cross-examination of witnesses as in ordinary litigation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<br><blockquote><p>8.—(1) In the following provisions of this paragraph, and in paragraph 9 below, "G.L.C. action area" means an action area in whose case it is indicated in the Greater London development plan that it is for the Greater London Council, and not a London borough council, to prepare a local plan for that area.
	<ol>
	<li>At any time before the Secretary of State's final approval of the Greater London development plan the Greater London Council may, if they think fit, prepare a local plan for the whole or part of a G.L.C. action area.</li>
	<li>At any time either before or after the Secretary of State's final approval of the Greater London development plan—
	<ol>
	<li>a London borough council may, if they think fit, prepare a local plan for the whole or any part of the borough;</li>
	<li>any two or more of the London borough councils may, with or without the Greater London Council, together prepare a joint local plan for the whole or any part of their respective boroughs; and</li>
	<li>any one or more such councils and any on or more adjacent planning authorities may, with or without the Greater London Council, together prepare a joint local plan for any part of their respective areas;</li></ol>
but this sub-paragraph shall not be taken to authorise the preparation of a local plan (joint or other) for the whole or any part of a G.L.C. action area.</li>
	<li>In the foregoing sub-paragraph, "adjacent planning authority" means a local planning authority whose area adjoins Greater London.</li>
	<li>Different local plans (joint or other) may be prepared for different purposes for the same part of any area.</li></ol></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<i>Duty of planning authorities to prepare local plans for action areas</i></p>

but this sub-paragraph shall not be taken to require a council to do again anything which they have already done.
	<ol>
	<li>In the case referred to in sub-paragraph (1)(	<i>b</i>)(ii) above, a London borough council 100 may comply with that sub-paragraph by joining with any other borough council concerned, with or without the Greater London Council, in the preparation of a joint local plan.</li>

	<ol>
	<li>Before giving a direction to a council under this paragraph the Secretary of State shall consult the council with respect thereto and, in the case of a direction to be given to a London borough council, he shall also, before giving it, consult the Greater London Council.</li></ol></p></blockquote></p>

	<li>The plan shall contain, or be accompanied by, such diagrams, illustrations and descriptive material as the council think appropriate for the purpose of explaining or illustrating the proposals in the plan, or as may be prescribed or as may in any particular case be specified in directions given by the Secretary of State; and any such diagrams, illustrations and descriptive material shall be treated as forming part of the plan.</li>
	<li>In formulating their proposals in the plan the council shall—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>secure that the proposals conform generally to the Greater London development plan as it stands for the time being (whether or not the Secretary of State has finally approved the plan, but taking into account any feature or element of it in the case of which he has indicated his approval), and</li>
	<li>have regard to any information and any other considerations which appear to them to be relevant, or which may be prescribed, or which the Secretary of State may in any particular case direct them to take into account.</li></ol>

and the council shall consider any representations made to them within the prescribed period.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allason</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We had no indication that this would be so.

This is a large Schedule, and while I do not attempt to question your ruling, Sir Stephen, might it not be more convenient to discuss the new Schedule at a later stage?

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate what the hon. Gentleman has said. I am serving the Committee, and my object in suggesting that it would be more convenient to discuss also the new Schedule with new Clause 2 was to telescope discussion and thus help the Committee.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir Stephen. It would be inconvenient to restrict discussion to the new Clause 2 because that Clause is introductory to the Schedule.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed</i>, That Clause 4 stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: New Clause No. 2 is intended as a substitute for Clause 4 as it appears in the Bill. The new Schedule is to replace Schedule 1 in the Bill. The Committee will remember that in the Town and Country Planning Act, 1968, which is now part of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1971, provision was made for the development plans of Greater London and for the transition stage from the development plans to the structure plans and thence to the local plans of the London boroughs. By means of Clause 4 we wish to make certain amendments to the present provisions relating to London and to provide for a much more streamlined form of structure plan and local plan procedure than we had set out in the 1968 Act. When we came to do that, we found that a great deal of cross-reference was necessary and, as a result, it was better to re-write the whole Schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it would be of assistance to the Committee if I were to detail where, in all this mass of print, there is anything new. Clause 4 and Schedule 1 to the Bill, as originally printed, proved to have a number of technical defects as well as this excessive amount of legislation by reference. I therefore took the opportunity to recast them completely with an amended version of Clause 4, introducing an amended version of Schedule 1, which now takes the form of a complete and self-contained replacement for Schedule
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0500">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>91</span>
4 of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1971.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The changes which are of substance are as follows. First, power is taken to approve the Greater London Development Plan in stages, that is to say, to approve any feature or element of the Plan while reserving the decision on other features and elements. That is paragraph 5(2) and consequential changes. There is no ulterior motive in this except that I foresee that when we have the report of the G.L.D.P. inquiry, there may be items in the Plan which then emerges with which we can deal at once. There may be other items which may need further consideration, not necessarily, I hope, to be put back to another inquiry but perhaps quite minor points to be tidied up. So it would be wise to have the power, at least, to approve parts of that Plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Act of 1971 gives the Secretary of State the power to approve structure plans, either in whole or in part and with or without modifications or reservations. That applies to the rest of the country and not to London. It does not apply to the Greater London Development Plan and, therefore, I have been advised that Schedule 5(2) of that Act, which does apply, would not permit approval of the Plan in stages. Therefore, it has had to have an amendment. It really only brings it in line with the rest of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second major change is this. The Bill, as it stands, prohibits the making of joint local plans for action areas. There is no justification for that restriction, and that is removed in the amended Schedule. In the Bill, that appears in Schedule 1, paragraph 8(2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, paragraph 7(	<i>a</i>)(i) of Schedule 1 as it stands provides, amongst other things, that Schedule 11(1) of the Act of 1971 shall not apply in Greater London and merely removes the power of the London borough councils to start the preparation of their local plans before the G.L.D.P. is approved. This result, which would put the London boroughs in an anomalous position compared with authorities outside London, was never really intended. The matter is put right in the new Schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fourth point is that the Bill already requires a London borough council, when preparing a local plan, to consult the Greater London Council. The amended draft Schedule imposes a similar obligation on the G.L.C. when it prepares a local plan. That is in paragraph 17(3).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>92</span>
Finally some very minor changes of substance apart from these have been made in the course of re-casting Schedule 4 to the Act of 1971, but these are points of detail designed to tidy up the complex procedure made necessary by the provisions for joint local plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So those are the changes of any real substance in the new Schedule as it appears on the Amendment Paper. New Clause No. 2 replaces Clause 4 of the Bill as it stands. Its principal function is to amend Section 19 of the Act of 1971, which introduces Schedule 1 in which the detailed provisions affecting development plans in Greater London are set out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first part of Section 19 of the Act of 1971, as it stands in Clause 4 of the Bill at present, is now contained in Schedule 1 to the Bill. Subsection (2) of the proposed new Clause makes some changes to Section 20(2) of the Act of 1971. That is the Section which defines what is to constitute the development plan for a London borough. That is consequen tial on the abolition of borough structure plans and the new power in paragraph 5(2) of the amended Schedule to approve the G.L.D.P. in stages. This subsection replaces subsection (3) of the present Clause 4 with some additional textual amendments to Section 20(2) of the Act of 1971.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Amendments have been printed and right hon. and hon. Members are able to read them and note the cross-references, it will be seen that they indicate the changes from the Bill which now appear in the Notice Paper as the amended Schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been necessary to go into print at length to make what is a common sense Amendment; that is, to enable the London boroughs to go ahead with their local plans and to treat the G.L.D.P. as the structure plan for the whole of London and its boroughs. At the same time it allows the boroughs, should they choose, to join together in making their local plans—in fact, to have complete freedom to do so. If any hon. Member wishes to comment on those points at this stage, I will sit down. If not, we might perhaps have a bonus of 20 minutes. I beg to move, That the debate be now adjourned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
