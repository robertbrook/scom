</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 7</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>CONTROL OF DEMOLITION IN CONSERVATION AREAS IN ENGLAND AND WALES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sydney Chapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 16, in page 9, line 16, leave out "or ceases to be in a conservation area".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this Amendment we are to take Amendment No. 23, in Clause 8, page 10, line 35, leave out from "building" to second "the" in line 36.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all accept that when one makes provision for trying to protect buildings in conservation areas, one naturally excludes listed buildings that are of architectural or historical interest, because the legislation protecting such buildings is far stronger than that proposed for other buildings of interest in conservation areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I question, however, whether the direction proposed in the Clause should include provision for excluding what I might term conservation area protected buildings if the conservation area ceases so to be. We all hope that none of the 1,750 areas—which we hope will increase to about 5,000 areas—will cease to be a conservation area. If that should happen, the point of the Amendment is to ensure that those buildings that the local authority has deemed should be protected should remain protected even if no longer in a conservation area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without the Amendment the Clause would give a loophole to local authorities. If a local authority, having protected a building, felt that it was in an embarrassing position and that the building should be pulled down, it could accomplish that by taking away the right of that building to be in a conservation area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a classic example of how one could have a conflict between environment and economy, or, in other words,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>142</span>
between conservation and commercialism. This modest Amendment seeks to delete the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"or ceases to be in a conservation area",</p></blockquote>
so that if any conservation area ceases to be such an area, the buildings will still be protected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Development (Mr. Graham Page)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Handsworth (Mr. Sydney Chapman) said that these buildings within a conservation area were protected because the local planning authority had deemed that they should be protected. Surely the authority would have deemed that they should be protected because they formed part of the conservation area. Clause 7 and Schedule 2 are designed to control the demolition of buildings only where this appears to be necessary—
	<br><blockquote><p>"…in the interests of preserving the character or appearance of the conservation area …"</p></blockquote>
That is the reason for the protection of these buildings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one removes the foundation and basis of that, one removes the conservation area, and one cannot say that one is protecting those buildings because they are preserving the character or appearance of something which is no longer there. Section 277 of the 1971 Act provides that a local planning authority may not only designate an area as a conservation area, but may also cancel any designation previously made. The planning authority has acted, while there has been a conservation area in existence, to protect certain buildings within that area because they help make up the character and appearance of that area. If it is then decided that it is no longer necessary to protect the area by keeping it as a conservation area, the whole reason for preservation of the buildings goes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 7 provides that where a building included in the direction
	<br><blockquote><p>"… ceases to be in a conservation area, then the direction shall cease to be in force as respects that building."</p></blockquote>
I am sure that that is right. The Amendment is mistaken because it would maintain the effect of a direction on a building even after the building ceased to be in a conservation area, which means after the whole purpose of the protection had gone. I must advise the Committee to resist the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0530">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>143</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully appreciate what the Minister says. The thought behind his comments today is perfectly sensible and to the point, but I wonder whether the wording totally achieves what he has said. Basically, he is advocating that where there is a conservation area, a building, which in other circumstances might have no control of demolition on it, now has control of demolition. If the area ceases to be a conservation area, the Minister says that there is no reason for that building not to revert to its former status and no longer be subject to the demolition control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have read the wording of the Clause two or three times and one tends to have a slightly different view each time. It is conceivable that a building which is listed and then becomes part of a conservation area might, if the area ceases to be a conservation area on this basis, be totally exempt from demolition control. I do not go as far as the hon. Gentleman. I cannot be absolutely certain about this. However, without asking for any undertaking at all, it would suit me if the Minister would look at it again to see whether he is satisfied with the wording.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Allason</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should recollect the object of this provision. I can best do that by giving an example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The street of which I am thinking had some fine early eighteenth century houses and an undistinguished Victorian house obtruded. The street is in a conservation area. The Victorian house was demolished, and because the developers cannot agree about a suitable replacement in a conservation area, there is an ugly gap. It would have been far better if that house had been allowed to stand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is preventing the demolition of houses with no merit. If it ceases to be in a conservation area, the point of protecting a house of no merit lessens. I cannot agree that this is a satisfactory Amendment. I should not attempt to argue with the right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin), but I suggest that he is stretching it a bit far by saying that when a listed building ceases to be in a conservation area, it may thereupon be demolished.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with great interest to what my hon. Friend the Minister said. I should like to make one
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>144</span>
comment on the remarks of the right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin). A listed building is a listed building, whether or not it is in a conservation area. If the conservation area ceases, the listed building is still protected. That is my interpretation of the law as it stands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not entirely satisfied with my hon. Friend's reply. The purpose of my Amendment is simply to protect as many interesting old buildings as possible. I make no apology for it. The argument is rather like the argument of the chicken and the egg. It is fair of my hon. Friend to say that the buildings which local authorities will have the power to protect under the Clause will be protected because they are in a conservation area, and that I accept, but one could equally say that the conservation area had been created because of the buildings within it. Once a building has a certain measure of protection, it would be wrong for us to remove that protection on the off-chance that the building happened no longer to be in a conservation area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend seeks the leave of the Committee to withdraw the Amendment, as I hope he will, I want to say that I think that there is some difficulty about the wording, as the right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) pointed out. The phrase "listed buildings" means buildings excepted from subsection (1). A listed building has two protections: first, it is listed as an historic building; secondly, it comes within a conservation area. By abolishing a conservation area, we must remove all the directions which come into operation because of the conservation area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find the wording of the Amendment a little difficult to understand. I should like to look at it again, but not on the basis that a building subject to a direction will remain subject to that direction after the conservation area has been abolished. I give no undertaking about that, because I think that it would be wrong to do so. It is confusing to talk about direction and listed buildings in the same breath, however, and I think that the wording needs some tidying up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Minister has said that, because I am entirely with him on his main contention. It is a question of whether the wording achieves the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0531">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>145</span>
necessary effect. I agree that it is a technical matter. If a building becomes a listed building by virtue of subsection (2), it becomes a listed building and subsection (1) takes over. That is the confusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of what has been said, I see no point in pressing the Amendment the purpose of which was to strengthen the protection of as many old buildings as possible. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 18, in page 9, line 39, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"; and, in particular, the local planning authority for the purpose of this section shall, in Greater London, be the Greater London Council and also, in relation to a London borough, the council of that borough".</p></blockquote>
The Amendment is necessary because some doubt has been cast on whether the existing provisions of Clause 7 would enable the Greater London Council, as well as the appropriate London borough council, to make a direction bringing within its control the demolition of specified unlisted buildings in conservation areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that we had included London in the Clause. However, the Amendment will put the matter beyond doubt by expressly providing that references to a local planning authority under Clause 7 are to be interpreted as including both the Greater London Council and the London borough council. The result will be that the Greater London Council, which already has the power to designate conservation areas will also have the right to give directions about protection of buildings within the conservation area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>GRANTS AND LOANS FOR PRESERVATION OR ENHANCEMENT OF CHARACTER OR APPEARANCE OF CONSERVATION AREAS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<br><blockquote><p>	<ol>
	<li>If the Secretary of State is of opinion that any area designated as a conservation area under section 277 of the Act of 1971 or, in Scotland, section 1 of the Civic Amenities Act 1967 is an area of outstanding architectural or historic interest, he may out of moneys provided by Parliament make grants or loans for the purpose of defraying in whole or in part any expenditure incurred or to be incurred in or in connection with, or with a view to the promotion of, the preservation or enhancement of the character or appearance of the area or any part thereof.</li>
	<li>A grant or loan under this section may be made subject to such conditions as the Secretary of State may think fit to impose.</li>
	<li>Any loan under this section shall be made on such terms as to repayment, payment of interest and otherwise as the Secretary of State may with the approval of the Treasury determine; and all sums received by the Secretary of State by way of interest on, or repayment of, such a loan shall be paid by him into the Consolidated Fund.</li>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0532">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>147</span>
	<li>Before making any grant or loan under this section, the Secretary of State shall con sult, both as to its making and as to the con ditions subject to which it should be made, with the appropriate Council, that is to say, according as the conservation area in question is in England, Scotland or Wales (including Monmouthshire), the Historic Buildings Coun cil for England, the Historic Buildings Council for Scotland, or the Historic Buildings Council for Wales:</li>
	<div class='ul'>
	<li>Provided that this subsection shall not apply in a case where the making of a grant or loan appears to the Secretary of State to be a matter of immediate urgency.</li></div> <!-- ul -->
	<li>The Secretary of State may out of moneys provided by Parliament pay to any member of any of the Councils referred to in subsection (4) above by whom services are rendered in connection with any question as to the exercise of his powers under this sec tion such remuneration and allowances as the Secretary of State may with the approval of the Minister for the Civil Service determine:</li>
	<div class='ul'>
	<li>Provided that, in the case of any such member who is also a member of the House of Commons, the payments which the Secretary of State may make under this subsection shall extend only to allowances in respect of travelling and subsistence expenses, and any other expenses necessarily incurred by that member in connection with the rendering of the services in question.—[	<i>Mr. Graham Page.</i>]</li></div> <!-- ul --></ol></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the Clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have great pleasure in moving the Clause, because it introduces a form of new grant by the Government to assist in the preservation of conservation areas. In another place, the noble lord, Lord Sand-ford, spoke of this matter and the Government felt that there was a gap in the provisions for the protection of conservation areas which could be filled. It was not to be done in quite the same way as the previous Government had considered filling it, but in a way which I hope the Committee will find satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the new Clause is to enable the Secretary of State to make either a grant or loan for expenditure incurred in connection with the preservation or enhancement of the character, or appearance, of any outstanding conservation area. The grant or loan will apply not just to any conservation area, but to one which we are advised will be outstanding. The grant will be for the preservation or enhancement of the character or appearance of that area, and is important for not merely preservation but enhancements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Clause has been modelled closely
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>148</span>
on the provisions of Section 4 of the Historic Buildings and Ancient Monuments Act, 1953, and Section 4 of the Civil Amenities Act, 1967. Those two together enable the Secretary of State, on the advice of the historic buildings councils, to make grants and loans for the purpose of defraying expenditure incurred in the repair or maintenance of buildings of historic or achitectural interest. As the Committee will know, there is an Historic Buildings Council for England, one for Scotland and one for Wales. I said that this provision would apply to conservation areas which we are advised to be of outstanding character, and the advice will come from the Historic Buildings Council, whether it be for England, Scotland or Wales, which has great experience and expertise in this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The idea of a grant of this sort originates from the Preservation Policy Group, set up as long ago as 1966 under the noble lord, Lord Kennet. One of the group's main recommendations—a report was published in 1970—was that there should be a new form of specific grant which would enable the Government to pay local authorities half the loss incurred by them in carrying out conservation schemes. When we studied that, it did not seem to fit the bill and we wanted more information and advice about how to apply a grant of this sort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Preservation Policy Group had also recommended pilot projects in the four historic towns, and those were being carried out at the time when the group's recommendations were announced. We said then that we should like to have further evidence of those pilot schemes to see how they worked before we decided exactly what form of grant there should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am particularly anxious that the form of grant should be as flexible as possible, and I thought that there would be some difficulty if we stuck to the formula of half the loss on conservation areas. Also, I wanted to extend it beyond payments merely to local authorities. There are occasions when amenities societies, and even individuals, could be helped to preserve and enhance the character or appearance of an outstanding conservation area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (1) has thus been drafted in general terms to allow for as wide a variety of schemes as possible. These
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0533">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>149</span>
schemes might, for instance, be works for the preservation or enhancement of an area, but I foresee ancillary schemes—perhaps the acquisition of land to open up an area in front of a building so that there is a clear view of the building; or the line of a terrace is improved. Specialist staff might be employed to survey and recommend improvement schemes on properties in accordance with their character and age and so on. We have public relations activities very much in mind and small amounts of money could frequently be spent on that sort of thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no restriction on the persons or bodies to whom the grant may be made. We shall rely entirely on the Historic Buildings Councils to tell us not only whether it is a case where a grant ought to be made, but to whom it shall be made: whether to the local authority, the owners of the property, an amenity society, or a historic buildings trust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) enables the Secretary of State to make such conditions as he considers desirable when making a grant or loan. Subsection (3) deals with the conditions of repayment of loans and the interest that may be payable, the terms of which must have Treasury approval as well as being determined by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (4) requires that the grant or loan shall be made only on the advice of the Historic Buildings Councils. As a result of a similar requirement in Section 4 of the Historic Buildings and Ancient Monuments Act, 1953, the councils have had nearly 20 years' experience in advising whether a building is an outstanding building and on the amount of grant or loan which could properly be made to preserve or enhance it. Similarly, the councils will be enabled to advise on what is an outstanding conservation area and which schemes should be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These councils include in their membership those with wide experience of planning and architecture. Schemes in England will be considered by a committee of the English Historic Buildings Council, a selected committee of people experienced in this type of advice. I imagine that the same procedure will apply in the case of Scotland and Wales, although I hesitate to speak for my right hon. Friends in that connection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (5) enables the Secretary of State to pay remuneration and allowances
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>150</span>
for services rendered by any member of a council in connection with the new functions arising under the Clause. This goes wider than our present intentions, and it is not sought to pay a number of people on the council, or the entire committee. However, the 1953 Act enables an honorarium to be paid to the chairman of a council in addition to his travel expenses, for it is recognised that an adviser will be involved in time and travel when carrying out investigations and advising the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The processing of the conservation schemes will, I think, involve an expert in a considerable amount of work, although not over a long period as his knowledge of the subject would enable him to reach conclusions fairly rapidly, without unduly keeping him from his normal work. It is felt that in those circumstances the chairman of the special committee should be offered an honorarium or fee so that he does not suffer hardship through undertaking this work. The honorarium which we have in mind is £1,500. As I have said, while it is not expected that an expert will be unduly detained from his normal duties, expert advice should be paid for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have great pleasure in announcing to the Committee this morning that we have been able to persuade someone of great renown to take on the job—Lord Holford himself. I am delighted to be able to announce that today. I do not want the Committee to think that we are taking Lord Holford away from the great services which he renders to the public in many other ways. I do not think that the job will take up a great amount of his time, but we must be fair and give him an honorarium for undertaking it. I am most grateful to Lord Holford for his acceptance of the task. It gives us confidence in the work envisaged, with the Government contributing £500,000 in the first year, building up to a greater amount in future years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore ask the Committee to accept not only the new Clause, but what I have said about the administration of the grant and the advice which we shall take in administering it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Blenkinsop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We warmly welcome the new Clause. I wonder whether we might persuade the Minister
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0534">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>151</span>
to delay the Bill a little longer: it could become a fascinating and important Measure. It has grown almost out of recognition from its modest beginnings, and I hope that the Minister will seriously consider any further proposals we may have to make the Bill an even more magnificent Measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I confess to some personal almost historic interest in this new Clause in the sense that I served on the Committee that set up the Historic Buildings Council a number of years ago. I remember the arguments we had then with some of our own supporters because of their anxiety about providing grants for belted earls. My friend Hugh Dalton spent a good deal of time persuading some of my colleagues of the value of the proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme has proved extremely valuable. I speak also as a member of the executive of the National Trust and I know how close the contacts have been between the work of the National Trust and the Historic Buildings Council. It would not have been possible to maintain many National Trust properties and the public enjoyment of them without the support and help of the Historic Buildings Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been arguments from time to time about whether sufficient money was available for all the work the council was asked to do, but I do not believe that any hon. Member would challenge the value and expertise of the council. I welcome the choice that has been made and the Minister's announcement about the expert adviser.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I served also on the Committee that set up what is now the Civic Amenities Act and I was one of the sponsors of the Measure. We have always recognised that one of the weaknesses of that Act was its lack of financial support such as that now being provided. Problems will inevitably arise and I have one or two comments to make. If the Minister cannot answer them now, I trust that he will do so later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, there is the difficulty of defining outstanding architectural or historic interest areas. When one tries to isolate areas to which special attention should be given, difficulties arise. What criteria should be used? I should more properly say, what criteria will the Historic Buildings Council use, because the Minister
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>152</span>
may say that he wishes to leave the decisions to that body. We have tried to encourage towns in industrial areas and elsewhere to take an interest in this matter. We argue that there is no town, no matter when it was founded or its industrial background today, that does not have examples of the past of great value and importance, and areas of amenity and attraction. These things are all relative and the judgments subjective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not been concerned merely with the great historic towns and cities of which we are so proud. The Ministry published some excellent reports on the four great historic cities, their problems and those of others in like category. We must be equally concerned with so many other places in more modest surroundings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My worry, and I should like the Minister's view, is that if one were to take a tough criterion of either historic importance or of particular amenity importance of individual buildings, one might rule out a number of these areas. They are of supreme importance educationally and in other ways to encourage people all over the country to feel that this is a matter of concern to them and not only to a few isolated places. I am not sure that that kind of problem is one which the Historic Buildings Council would find easy to solve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are all anxious about the problems which may be arising in Bath and elsewhere concerning the condition of some properties in conservation areas, not only externally but internally. I should like to know whether this provision is widely enough drawn. I should like the assurance that it will permit dealing with suitable cases of maintenance of some interiors where they are of importance, as well as exteriors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that there are many other features to discuss, but I hope that this new proposal receives full publicity. I am sure that with the co-operation of bodies like the Civic Trust there will be an attempt to bring it to wide attention. I welcome the comment about using some funds in suitable cases for public relations explanatory work. We need co-operation among all kinds of voluntary bodies, ranging from the National Trust to small local bodies. It may well be that a contribution from this fund will make possible activity and action that otherwise would not take place. I welcome the new
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0535">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>153</span>
Clause, but I should be glad if the Minister would offer some comments on the matters I have mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Marks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I add my welcome to the new Clause and express the hope that £500,000 will be exceeded in future years, because there is great need for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a general statement and the details are to be left to councils most concerned with it and having most knowledge of it. I should like to add to what has been said by my hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Mr. Blenkinsop) about the need to consider not only great historical places, but the need to preserve some of the tiny gems in industrial conurbations, for example the Wellington Inn in Manchester which may not attract second glances in York, Tewkesbury or Worcester, but which in Manchester is regarded as of outstanding importance, so much so that a huge development is being set aside to enable the inn to be retained and raised four feet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are also Tudor farmhouses which have somehow managed to escape the industrial sprawl and suburban building of the past few years in South-East Lancashire. They may not attract immediate attention from the council, but in areas where they are few and far between they are regarded as gems, and as such they should be helped to remain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the birthplaces of people who have been important in our history will also be regarded as important in our preservation programme, although the buildings themselves may not be of great architectural importance. There are buildings of historic importance which are not Gothic, or thatched cottages. Some eighteenth century mills are of tremendous historic importance; there is one at Styal in Cheshire, about 10 miles outside Manchester—fortunately owned by the National Trust—is complete with apprentice houses, cottages, truck shop and so on. I hope that that type of building, too, as well as historical monuments will be considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are dealing with the character and appearance of a conservation area. In a conservation area, it is not primarily the historic or architectural buildings that we are preserving, but the area. If they are of great value historically or architecturally, they should come
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>154</span>
under the listed buildings process and be individually protected. We are considering the protection of an area and in order to preserve and enhance that area we are prepared to make available certain grants and loans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for South Shields (Mr. Blenkinsop) asked whether the money could be spent on the interior of the premises. If I were to give a direct answer now it would have to be "No", because we are dealing with the character and appearance of an area. If the interior required repair to preserve the building, it would come within the terms of the Clause. But generally speaking it is the outside of the buildings with which we are concerned, the structure to keep them standing, and improvement to their appearance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would apply to the instances cited by the hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Mr. Marks) when he referred to the Wellington Inn and Tudor farmhouses throughout Lancashire. If they are single buildings, they should be listed properly as historic buildings or of architectural value. If they are in a conservation area, they could come within the terms of the Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that one is often guided in designating an area as a conservation area by its historical association with its people. Primarily, of course, one looks to the character and appearance of an area, but an area also has a character from its historic associations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that we should continue with the concept of a conservation area. We shall take the advice of the Historic Buildings Councils concerning the outstanding areas. Having considered that advice, we shall decide what buildings require preservation in order to retain the character and appearance of that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot lay down a criterion for the word "outstanding". That is the reason for bringing in the Historic Buildings Councils. The fact that they are called the Historic Buildings Councils does not mean that they look only at historic buildings—I am sure that the Committee realises that. They look at buildings of architectural as well as historic value. They will be able to advise us, using their own criteria and experience, about industrial towns as well as famous historic cities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am often impressed, when driving through an industrial area, to see some of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0536">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>155</span>
the elegant buildings covered in black dust and hidden away down side streets. Some of the architecture that was used in the days of the industrial revolution, when one thought of putting up buildings indiscriminately anywhere, was extremely good. I am sure that these examples will be spotted and that we shall be correctly advised by the Historic Buildings Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blenkinsop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister say something more about the interiors of properties? I accept that the general concern in a conservation area is exteriors, but one of the problems is to find a scheme which will enable an area to live and not become a neglected museum piece. Therefore, schemes are required for keeping conservation areas in active use for bringing in revenue, for preserving staircases and things of that kind which are part of the atmosphere of an area. It is an area issue. I hope that what the Minister has said will not necessarily rule out such examples. The Historic Buildings Council will obviously be well aware of this matter. The problem arises in areas like Bath. The interiors are sometimes just as important as the exteriors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is right to say that we have managed to preserve some wonderful examples of architecture, but when one compares the position with large parts of France, one is conscious of how much one has lost in the process of the Industrial Revolution. One therefore needs to be even more anxious. The idea of area preservation was actively promoted in France, and we have learned quite a bit from the French in this regard. Although I feel that this is a proposition of great importance, I hope that we will not exclude altogether the possibility of suitable cases of contribution to schemes that include preservation and improvement of interiors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must be a little tough about this and say again that the grant is for the preservation of the appearance, rather than the interior, of buildings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two possibilities here of improvement to the interior of the buildings. It may be important to preserve a beautiful staircase within a building. However, that is not the intention of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>156</span>
grant. The right thing to do in such a case would be to press for the building to be listed as one of historic or architectural value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member was saying that it was not good enough to "tart-up" the outside of a building—if I may put it vulgarly that way—leaving the inside uninhabitable. Again, I do not think that the grant could be used for that purpose. It may well be that a Victorian building is worth preserving within a conservation area, but the rooms have such high ceilings that they are uneconomical either to heat or to use. The right way to improve the inside would be completely to rebuild within the shell of the building, making two floors for every one original floor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But this would not be the sort of thing to which a grant under this provision could be made. One would have to look for assistance elsewhere. The solution in all these cases where the building is worth preserving in that way is to seek to have it properly listed as of historical or architectural value.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

new Clause No. 2 which presents me with some difficulty. We have already discussed it and normally it would be my duty to call upon the Minister to move it formally.

On the other hand, the Committee may well feel that as the Minister has been in a generous mood so far this morning, perhaps to debar him from saying anything more than a formal moving might withhold some other good news from the Committee.

I am afraid that I have no further good news to give, Sir Stephen, but I am grateful to you for giving me the opportunity of clearing up something which I said previously and which I am advised is wrong. May I make something of a personal statement while moving new Clause No. 2? I am told that my comments at column 98 of the Third Sitting on 2nd May could be misconstrued. This was in connection with the power to approve G.L.D.P. in stages. It will not be possible for borough local plans to be given publicity and adopted until the G.L.D.P. has been finally approved, but preparation of local plans may go ahead meanwhile. Although it may be necessary to deal with the G.L.D.P. in stages, we hope that final approval will not be so far off as to hold up the adoption of local plans.

Frankly, I thought that that was what I said. However, I am told that it is not what I was reported to have said, and so I am grateful to be able to make this correction in case anybody should misunderstand it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>158</span>
1971, such authority may recover the reasonable cost of such works summarily as a civil debt from the person who is then the owner of the building:</p></blockquote>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sydney Chapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the Clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After the warm welcome we have given to the first two new Clauses, I am sure that my hon. Friends will wish to respond on the next two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new Clause is concerned with works to preserve listed buildings, which is, I submit, a technical but important point. In discussing listed buildings, or conservation areas, one has in mind the Civic Amenities Act, 1967. Personally, I think that that is a wonderful Act on which those who were associated with it in any way should be congratulated, and not least, my right hon. Friend the Member for Streatham (Mr. Sandys), who has done so much to try to strengthen legislation to protect listed buildings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Committee will know, Section 6 of the Civic Amenities Act, 1967, has now been consolidated. All legislation concerned with listed buildings is now to be found in Sections 54 to 58 of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1971, while the enforcement of control may be found in Sections 96 to 101 of that Act. As the new Clause refers specifically to Section 101, it might be helpful to read it to the Committee. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If it appears to a local authority that any works are urgently necessary for the preservation of any unoccupied building situated in their area which—
	<ol>
	<li>is included in a list compiled or approved under section 54 of this Act; and</li>
	<li>is not an excepted building as defined in section 58(2) of this Act,</li>
</ol>
they may, after giving to the owner of the building not less than seven days' notice in writing of the proposed execution of the works, take such steps as they consider appropriate for executing the works."</p></blockquote>
In other words, if, under existing legislation, an owner of an unoccupied listed building deliberately leaves it in a state of neglect, the local authority may enter the building and do the necessary repairs so that, in effect, the building will not have to be demolished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, this Section, originally Section 6 of the Civic Amenities Act, 1967, did
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0538">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>159</span>
not give local authorities power to recover the reasonable costs of the work involved in entering the building and carrying out repairs. In this connection, I should like to submit four points for the Committee's consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the purpose of the new Clause is to close a loophole, one admitted by successive Governments since the Civic Amenities Act became law. Secondly, the new Clause does not seek to establish a dangerous precedent. Many enforcement notices in relation to town planning matters give power to the local authority to recover the expenses incurred in ensuring that the enforcement notice is carried out. For example, Section 99(1) of the 1971 Act states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… the authority may enter the land and take those steps, and may recover from the person who is then the owner of the land any expenses reasonably incurred by them in doing so."</p></blockquote>
That is only one example of the power already given to local authorities under successive Town and Country Planning Acts to recover the expenses of carrying out enforcement notices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, I believe that some local authorities—I do not wish to exaggerate the position—may have hesitated to move into a building to effect repairs necessary to prevent dereliction and demolition because the charges involved would fall as yet another burden upon the rates. For that reason. I think that such charges, on those occasions when it is necessary for a local authority to act in that way, could and should be recovered summarily as a civil debt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nor would the provisions of the new Clause penalise ordinary people who would find the bills for restoration and maintenance beyond their purse. They are rather aimed at those who seek to put commercialism before conservation, those developers with unlimited resources who try to circumvent the present laws by allowing old buildings to fall into a state of disrepair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus, the new Clause would not open floodgates whereby a mass of local authorities would suddenly move into these buildings, effect repairs, and subsequently charge exorbitant expenses to the owners of the buildings. On the contrary, it would prevent the need for local authorities to enter such buildings, as it
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>160</span>
would give them an extra weapon which would inhibit owners from letting these important buildings fall into a state of disrepair or dereliction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend new Clause 3 to the Committee by emphasising that we have relatively few old buildings in the country, and for the sake of future generations we ought to see that they are kept in a good state of repair. I believe that the new Clause will make a modest contribution towards that end.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On this side of the Committee we all welcome the principle behind the new Clause. Where there is a danger of a listed building falling down or being allowed to degenerate into such a state of disrepair that it becomes an eyesore and is no longer an attraction to the area, a local authority in default of the owner taking action, could go into the building and carry out the work itself. The new Clause would also empower an authority in certain circumstances to recover a reasonable charge from the owner of the building.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where we part company to some extent from the hon. Member for Birmingham, Handsworth (Mr. Sydney Chapman) is his emphasis on the recovery of money aspect rather than the power to go into a building to stop it from crumbling. I am surprised that the hon. Member did not link his new Clause with new Clause No. 1, as we thought he would. I can envisage a situation where a local authority might need to go into property, not only unoccupied—although Section 101 limits this power to unoccupied property—to effect works and then could apply to the Government for a grant or loan under new Clause No. 1 for the work done. I should have thought that that was a perfectly proper thing for an authority to do without recourse to the owner, depending on the circumstances, to recover the money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The owner of the property might not be a developer, or someone able to afford the cost of keeping an old house in a good state of repair. What we are asking that owner to do is to keep that house not only as an attraction for himself, but for the public. If we are asking an owner to keep an attractive building of architectural merit not only for his own benefit but for ours, there will be circumstances in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0539">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>161</span>
which we must be prepared to help him to pay for its maintenance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not put the emphasis that the hon. Member puts on the recovery side of the new Clause, but I strongly support the principle that the local authority should be able to go in and effect the repairs. I should like to extend the provisions beyond those in Section 101 to include some occupied buildings. Work often needs to be done to preserve the antiquity of a building although it is tenanted. Under Section 101, nothing could be done. The property has to be unoccupied before the provisions of Section 101 may be brought into play.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is covered by Section 99 (1) of the 1971 Act, which is entitled—
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is covered by Section 99 (1) of the 1971 Act, which is entitled—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Execution and cost of works required by listed buildings enforcement notice."</p></blockquote>
Under subsection (1) the local authority has power to recover money. This is to close the loophole concerning the unoccupied listed building.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under that Section it may have power to recover the money. The hon. Member is providing it again in the new Clause for the unoccupied building as distinct from the occupied building. Is that not right?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. Member for making that clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the hon. Member's attention to the wording of the proviso. It is so fierce that I feel that no planning authority would dare to do anything because of its terms. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that it shall be a defence to an action for such recovery"—</p></blockquote>
that is, of the money—
	<br><blockquote><p>"that the said works (or part of them) were not urgently necessary for the preservation of the building."</p></blockquote>
In court a local authority would be in the difficult position that unless it could prove that the building was in imminent danger of collapse and that every part of the work that it had effected was purely to prevent that collapse, its recovery case might be thrown out, possibly because part of the work had been carried out not merely to preserve the building, but to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>162</span>
beautify it. As for urgency; an authority might have been not "tarting it up", to use an expression used earlier, but keeping it attractive rather than preventing it from crumbling into a mass of stones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I support the hon. Member's desire to allow a local authority to go in for that purpose and not restrict it, his proviso is so fierce that it could prevent a local authority from acting, because the town clerk would strongly advise the authority to be careful. It is almost the "Merchant of Venice" situation—not a drop of blood must be spilled. If one half-hour of work is done that is not limited to the actual preservation of the building, a defence could be that the whole of the work and recovery cost be struck out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to hear the Minister's comments on the right of an authority to enter property, whether occupied or unoccupied. If there is reason to effect works on the building which the owner cannot afford, or which will not be of major benefit to him, but would be of benefit to the public, the powers generously given by the Minister under new Clause 1 could be brought into effect and the money spent from a Government grant or loan to the planning authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allason</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with what the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) has said and I disagree with my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hands-worth (Mr. Sydney Chapman). My hon. Friend put all the emphasis on the situation where an owner was deliberately allowing his building to fall into neglect in the hope of reaping a rich harvest by demanding the right of development. But surely Section 117 of the 1971 Act deals with that situation. There is a grave discouragement there against anyone deliberately allowing a building to fall into neglect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note that there is another Amendment designed to improve Section 117, and I should have thought that that was the proper place to make sure that the greedy developer did not reap a harvest by being neglectful. Surely the more usual case is that the owner does not have the means to support a great pile which he has inherited. What could be afforded a century or two ago can no longer be afforded by people who have to pay the present heavy rates of income tax. It is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0540">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>163</span>
dangerous to propose to recover from a poverty-stricken owner costs of doing work which he does not want to do, work not in his interests to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had a rather interesting example in my constituency. A listed building was bought by the district council with a view to redevelopment. The council neglected the premises and one had an unpleasant suspicion that it was prepared to see the premises become derelict. It had redevelopment plans in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On my advice, the county planning authorities served an enforcement notice on the district council, which was required to put the property into good repair. In turn, it had the worry that as it was empty, it could have found that the county would have been carrying the bill, and not the district council. However, in the event this brought matters to a head, and I am happy to say that the building is now preserved and put to good use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the sort of thing that is liable to happen, though in the case of the district council the owner was not poverty-stricken, but for the poverty-stricken private individual there is the danger of over-zealous enforcement. A local authority, knowing that it may recover costs, may go slap-happy in demanding that a derelict building shall be put back into apple-pie order when it is unacceptable to the owner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Derek Walker-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be the last to discourage my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Handsworth (Mr. Sydney Chapman) whose approach to these matters we all respect and admire. We all share his general sentiments in seeking to make preservation as active an instrument as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend's main justification for his new Clause is that it closes a loophole, perhaps an inadvertent loophole, in which case it is simply closed, or perhaps something omitted from the pattern of the legislation with intent and in principle. It may be the second of those considerations that applies here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the years, the law on this matter has been strengthened to the point where it now appears in the consolidating Act of 1971. There is still a distinction made in the law between the position of those who take active steps of an anti-social nature involving a contravention of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>164</span>
enforcement notices, for example, and cases of passive dereliction which may be due to reasons of calculation, but may equally well be due and—as my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. Allason) has just said—are more usually due to circumstances compelling the inability of the owner to take further steps.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we find in the law as it stands is that active steps lead to a pecuniary penalty, recovery of expenses and so on, and passive failure does not. Passive failure is dealt with, as my hon. Friend has pointed out, under Section 117(1), limiting compensation, and that subsection has as its operative condition the word "deliberately"—if the authorities are satisfied that the building has been deliberately allowed to fall into disrepair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his new Clause my hon. Friend does not reproduce this term. He puts a blanket liability upon owners, whether their failure to maintain results from deliberate calculation or, as is more normally the case, from economic considerations or inability.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. and learned Gentleman clear up one point for me? Section 117 deals with the position after the horse, or house, has bolted. By then it is too late to preserve it. I thought that the point of the hon. Gentleman's new Clause was to deal with the situation before it had fallen into disrepair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir D. Walker-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes and no. The new Clause does not affect in any way the power of the local authority to do the works. What the right hon. Gentleman is suggesting would apply only if there were no power now for a local authority to do the works. The horse cannot bolt: it is only a question of who is to pay for the oats.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position is that we have that dichotomy in the law—my hon. Friend in moving his new Clause prayed in aid of Sections 98 and 99 of the 1971 Act—where the monetary provisions in those Sections relate to active contravention of a listed building enforcement notice. That may be seen from Section 96(1) from which it stems:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where it appears to the local planning authority that any works have been, or are being, executed to a listed building in their</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0541">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>165</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>area and are such as to involve a contravention of section 55(1) or (4) …"</p></blockquote>
The condition governing the recovery of money from an owner is two-fold: there has to be a contravention and there have to be active steps.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the principle we discern from the law as it exists. Going on from there involves a value judgment of a philosophical character. My hon. Friend is saying in his new Clause that that is not enough and that we must also get the person who has passively failed. That is in contravention of the principle—"Thou shalt not kill buts needst not strive officiously to keep alive".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need not go as far as that. The material fact is that it would be a strong step forward in the relations between the citizen and authority to make the extention which my hon. Friend's new Clause would make and to impose on the citizen a pecuniary liability, irrespective of whether the circumstances had come about through his deliberate intent, or through his inability to do better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In principle, it is better, as the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) has said, that in these cases the community, having the power which it should have to do the urgent repairs, should nevertheless stand the cost as its contribution to amenity in these relatively exceptional cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should add two short technical criticisms of the new Clause. The proviso which the hon. Member for Widnes referred to makes the sole defence in summary proceedings that the works were not urgently necessary for the preservation of the building. That is difficult. I can think of few matters less lending themselves to a satisfactory adjudication in a summary proceeding for civil debt than whether the works were urgently necessary, the matter necessarily being tried after the works had been carried out and the original state of the building difficult to reconstruct. I have great respect for the courts which would be trying these matters, but I doubt whether they would take this easily in their stride.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The further criticism I have of the proviso is that it specifies one defence. On the canons of construction, the expression of one excludes the other and therefore the new Clause is deliberately drafted in a most Draconian fashion to exclude any other possible defence, be it what it may,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>166</span>
that the unfortunate owner might have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The term "owner" is difficult. The ordinary proceedings for enforcement notice, as may be seen from Section 96 and that fasciculus of Sections of the 1971 Act, is service on the owner and occupier. The occupier is an ascertainable person; owner is more difficult to ascertain, as my hon. Friend will see if he looks at Section 290 of the 1971 Act where the definition of "owner" states
	<br><blockquote><p>"a person, other than a mortgagee not in possession, who, whether in his own right or as trustee for any other person, is entitled to receive the rack rent of the land, or, where the land is not let at a rack rent, would be so entitled if it were so let."</p></blockquote>
Clearly it would not be easily ascertainable in every case, because the land would not be let at a rack rent and one would have to try to interpret the last words of that definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, I do not wish to discourage my hon. Friend from his welldoing, but I had a case—Cusack Smith and Others 	<i>v</i> Corporation of London—in my professional capacity many years ago on the meaning of "owner" under this definition. I was acting for the Corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Divisional Court, headed by the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Goddard, we won by three judges to nil. There was an appeal to the Court of Appeal and we lost by three Lord Justices of Appeal to nil, making it three all. We appealed to the Apellate Committee of the House of Lords and succeeded by three Lords of Appeal to two, making a net count of 6 to 5 at the end of the day. That ridded me of any temptation ever to apologise to clients for any momentary uncertainty in advising them as to the precise meaning of the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulties in these matters are accentuated by the fact that this is all coming within a seven-day urgency operation. Therefore I suggest that this is a new Clause of good intent, but not suitable in its present form for incorporation in the Statute Book.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have so many times said that it is not for hon. Gentlemen here to act as unpaid draftsmen for the Government. It is for them to put across the principle that they want to establish and then to let the Government pay its underpaid draftsmen to do the rest. While the right hon. and learned Gentleman's strictures are entertaining and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0542">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>167</span>
valuable, they would be better directed to the draftsmen than to hon. Gentlemen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir D. Walker-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely concur with what the right hon. Gentleman has said. My concluding observations were addenda, having dealt with the principle of the matter. I wholly agree that if it were not for the objection in principle, no doubt these matters could be tidied up, albeit with some difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but nevertheless the right hon. and learned Gentleman will agree that while it may be difficult to define an elephant, if one came through the door we should know what it was. Therefore, I do not think it important whether the new Clause is in the form it is or not. More important is the principle of asking what is urgently necessary to preserve a building.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one examines the principle of the new Clause, one sees that Section 117 has no relevance. The hon. Member for Birmingham, Handsworth (Mr. Sydney Chapman) is trying to ensure that a local authority is not discouraged from intervening before an unoccupied building falls totally into disrepair by the fear that it will have to pay for the work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To some extent the Minister has helped a great deal by new Clause No. 1, because it may well be that the local authority will be able to say, "This is splendid: we can get a grant from the Historic Buildings Council and will be able to carry out the work on that basis." There may be occasions when it cannot. Whether it is a question of, "Thou shalt not kill, but need'st not strive …", or whether it is an instance of some poor widow or orphan who happens to own an historic building does not enter into it. What is essential is that encouragement be given to the local authority to preserve a building. That is why the new Clause is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quite understand the right hon. and learned Gentleman's contention and he sees mine, for he said that it was a question of who paid for the oats. But unless one gives encouragement to the local authority, it may not take the necessary steps. Incidentally, Draconian or not, it is rightly permissive; not mandatory. New Clause No. 3 says that the local authority may recover the reasonable cost of such works; it does not say it shall. If it had, I might have thought that it had gone too
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>168</span>
far. Most local authorities are reasonable enough to distinguish between the poor widow and orphan and the greedy profiteer. Even if they were not, there is still the Minister's new Clause No. 1 to assist them. They may seek the advice of the Historic Buildings Council, which would say, "This is a case where you can get a grant perfectly adequately," and the problem would not arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Defective as new Clause No. 3 is, it is our duty if the Minister cannot assist us—frankly, I think that he ought to be sympathetic to the principle and tell us what he proposes to do—to take the question to a Division. It might not be carried—probably it would not be—but that is not important. It would at least force the Minister's hand. It would force him doubly if it were carried, because it is defective for the reasons which have been given, to bring in an amended new Clause. If it were not carried, it would be so nearly not carried that it would also have some jogging effect on the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This will all be unnecessary if the Minister gives us some favourable words and some help in dealing with a problem that the hon. Gentleman has fairly outlined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has asked me to give some favourable words, but I do not know to whom I should address them. There appears to be a split in the Opposition between the right hon. Gentleman and his colleagues as to whether we should carry a defective Clause or defeat it. I am certainly being asked to admit a defective Clause into the Bill if what the right hon. Gentleman says is his true belief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new Clause deserved a full debate because it originated from the Preservation Policy Group, which recommended a similar Clause whereby a local authority should be able to recover certain expenses. I do not wish to hide anything from the Committee. No doubt if I did, someone would find it out. But shortly after the Preservation Policy Group issued its report, my Department issued a circular saying that we accepted its recommendation. Much has happened since then, but before I deal with the progress historically, I want to consider the 1971 Act, to which right hon. and hon. Members have referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0543">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>169</span>
First, there are the enforcement Sections—Sections 96 to 99—whereby a local authority, if it carries out certain works, has the right to recover from an owner or occupier the cost of those works. But these works are in connection, if they are carried out by virtue of Sections 96 and 99, with unlawful work being carried out on the property. Something unlawful has been done, with the result that an enforcement notice has been served, and the process of the enforcement notice and the possibility of objecting to it has gone forward against an unlawful act. That does not apply to the situation that my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Handsworth (Mr. Sydney Chapman) envisages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 117 of the 1971 Act was mentioned. It deals with property that has been deliberately allowed to get into disrepair for a certain purpose, and the penalty, if it be a penalty, under that Section is that a local authority may acquire the property at something under its value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 101, to which the new Clause would be an Amendment, deals with the instance of a local authority wishing to preserve a listed building entering the building when it is unoccupied and carrying out works on it. In those circumstances, the law does not entitle a local authority to recover from the owner the money spent on those repairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend called it a loophole. One wonders why such an obvious loophole was not closed at the time. Perhaps it was not thought right that a local authority in those circumstances should have the right to recover costs which would be expended in the interests of the community in preserving that building. I know that in so doing it may also be putting some added value on the building to the benefit of the owner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the Preservation Policy Group recommended statutory provisions such as this, there has been a development of thought concerning the conservation grant, which I detailed when moving a new Clause earlier today. We have now, by means of that new Clause, a full code of Government responsibility for the preservation of these buildings, whether they be listed buildings or buildings of outstanding character that ought to be preserved within a conservation area. We have under these grants, whether it be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>170</span>
under existing grants for historic buildings or grants for buildings within a conservation area, a code whereby it is recognised that the community has a responsibility to preserve those buildings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Handsworth referred on several occasions to buildings being allowed to get into a state of dereliction. If a building gets into that state, the local authority has other powers under Health Acts and Dangerous Structure Acts to serve notices and see that repairs are carried out. What we are dealing with here is a local authority considering work necessary for the preservation of a building because it is a listed historic building, and carrying out that work in order to preserve the building for the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it right to leave the Section as it appears in the 1971 Act. It is a repetition of a provision which has stood some years of test. Although one may wish to encourage local authorities to enter upon property, repair it, and have a right to reclaim the money, I do not know of any outstanding cases where local authorities have feared to enter merely because they would not have a right to recover the money from the owner. I do not think that local authorities would take that view, and I doubt whether my hon. Friend's new Clause would be the encouragement he thinks it might be to local authorities to do this work. I think that they would do it without that kind of encouragement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be a fairly substantial step in the relationship between the local authority and the citizen to say that, when the citizen has done nothing unlawful, the local authority should be entitled to enter his property without his consent and repair it, and then charge him the cost of those repairs. We should hesitate before putting that provision into the Statute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have been encouraged to put it in as a statutory obligation on an owner had we not thought out this policy of grants. If there were no such policy, there might have been a good argument for a new Clause of this nature. But now we have developed the policy, and have a code dealing with historic buildings right through into conservation area buildings, I think that should be sufficient.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the Minister spell out the policy for the available grants?
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0544">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>171</span>
Would it be possible, without the new Clause, for a local authority, feeling that repairs were needed to a building, occupied or unoccupied, to go in and effect the necessary repairs, and then claim a grant from the Government under the provisions of new Clause No. 1?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I would not say in all cases. It covers instances where the Historic Buildings Council advises that a grant should be made to preserve a building. As the hon. Gentleman knows one may apply to the Historic Buildings Council for assistance, either by grant or loan, to preserve a listed building. The fact that it is listed does not necessarily mean that a grant or loan wil be made. The council considers the situation entirely on its merits. In my own constituency, only last week, a grant was refused to preserve a rather beautiful windmill in the middle of a residential area. I am distressed by the decision, but that is the situation: the council did not think it right to grant a loan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that that decision is right. If a local authority is allowed, purely on its own initiative and discretion, to go in and make repairs, it should be prepared to stand the costs thereof. An authority may seek the advice of the Historic Buildings Council on whether such preservation is truly valuable to the public. If it is, the grant or loan will be made. Such a distinction must be made, and, if the preservation is in the interests of the community, the new scheme will be of assistance. If the preservation proves not to be for that purpose, the local authority must bear the costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) for his support. I realise that I am on dangerous ground with lawyers. However, I can only say in my defence that it appears, from the excellent story told by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, East (Sir D. Walker-Smith) that lawyers often disagree among themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise to the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) for appearing to place the emphasis on the powers to recover the expenses. That was inevitable. Present legislation already specifies the power to carry out the work, so that it was necessary to stress the point of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>172</span>
recovery of expenses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like to add that the proviso at the end is deliberate. I believe that it is necessary. I cannot recall any town planning legislation where that kind of proviso is already included, but I think it is in respect of enforcement notices, for example, in respect of waste land:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that it shall be a defence to an action for such recovery that the said works (or part of them) were not urgently necessary …"</p></blockquote>
I shall return to that because I think that I am on stronger ground than some of my hon. Friends and right hon. and hon. Members opposite thought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like to reiterate that people who need money to bring their listed building into a state of decent repair may get a grant or a loan or, as a last resort, serve a notice on the local authority asking it compulsorily to acquire the property. Thus, it is not a fair criticism of the new Clause to say it will necessarily affect those owners who cannot help themselves and who may be penalised if the new Clause is adopted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the point of my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. Allason) who quoted Section 117 of the 1971 Act and said that it dealt only with minimum compensation. I do not think that that covers the point which I seek to make in the new Clause. Without wishing to be emotive, I observe a person may deliberately allow a listed building to reach such a state of neglect as to warrant demolition because he wishes to obtain the development value of the land on which the property stands. The point in relation to Section 117 is that such a person could not care less about minimum compensation, as he will make a great deal more money on the development value of the land. Thus, I do not consider that Section 117 would cover the situation described by my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allason</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend study Section 114 of the Act by which a local authority in those circumstances may acquire the property? Surely that is the way to deal with the unscrupulous developer who has allowed the property to fall into neglect. The local authority thereby acquires the valuable assets, while the developer receives only the minimum compensation provided for in Section 117.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful for your ruling, Sir Stephen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept what my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. Allason) said about Section 114. Briefly, my reply would be that if that were the case, there would be no need for Section 101. I hope that that goes some way to answer my hon. Friend's point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also accept some of the comments that the Minister made. I refrained from mentioning the Preservation Group Policy Committee and the statement of the Department that followed it. My hon. Friend will be aware that the new Clause was originally Clause 5 of my Urban and Rural Environment Bill, which went through its Committee stage unamended last Session, but which, due to lack of parliamentary time, proceeded no further. It is a fair defence of the new Clause that my hon. Friend, who watched over that very important Private Member's Bill, was not moved to make any comment at that stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, East (Sir D. Walker-Smith) made an important point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir D. Walker-Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend continues, perhaps he can link the two points. Is he correct in what he has said concerning the provisions about waste land? I can find no such proviso, in the terms of his proviso, in the Sections of the Act which deal with waste land. Furthermore, surely the two situations are not comparable as an owner of waste land is given many grounds of appeal under Section 105. Thus, it is not open to the objection which I ventured to make concerning the new Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. and learned Friend. As I have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>174</span>
said, I am not a lawyer, and I do not seek to challenge the legal point which my right hon. and learned Friend has made. He tried eloquently to differentiate between a passive dereliction of duty and a positive flouting of the law, in other words, where a man may deliberately build without planning permission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I wonder whether there is such a fundamental difference. In this connection, I refer my right hon. and learned Friend to Section 107 of the Act concerning waste land which has become unsightly. Under successive Town and Country Planning Acts, including the 1971 Act, a local authority may serve an enforcement order, asking an owner to tidy up land, failing which the authority is empowered to undertake the work involved and claim expenses from him. That seems to be an exact parallel to the proposal of new Clause No. 3.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The defence is—and here I revert to the proviso in the last two lines of the new Clause—that in effecting the works to restore the waste land to a more sightly appearance, no work is undertaken unreasonable to the restoration of a reasonably sightly appearance. Again, there is a direct parallel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hesitate to go further into legal arguments. However, because under existing legislation a local authority which effects repairs in unoccupied listed buildings cannot necessarily recover the money spent by means of a grant—notwithstanding the acceptance of new Clause No. 1—and because, even if that were the case, I think that the owners of such property ought to pay in certain cases—I revert to the position of the developer who deliberately allows a property to fall into neglect to ensure demolition—I shall press the new Clause to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The support we give to the hon. Gentleman is support in principle for what the Clause attempts. The Minister said that we appeared to be divided. We are not divided about the principle, and we all agree with what the hon. Gentleman is trying to do, and certainly he will have our support if he does press the new Clause to a Division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where there is a difference is about the wording. As my hon. Friend said, if the Government accept the principle, it is for them to put the wording right. We do not expect the hon. Gentleman to draft a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0546">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>175</span>
water-tight Clause, but the principle we support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 117 deals with deliberate acts done with a motive, with an end in view. What the hon. Gentleman is trying to do and what we support, is not to deal with the developer who wants the place to fall into ruins so that he may sell the site—Section 117 deals with that. We want to help the person who has an historic building, or one that the local authority has decided to list, who may himself want to co-operate because he bought the building, but who may not be able to afford to co-operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difference between deliberate waste and doing nothing, when the local authority steps in, is not a new problem. The Minister, as well as my right hon. Friend, knows of the old equitable doctrine of latches—where one deliberately does nothing and thereby creates damage</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The new Clause is concerned with minimum compensation in case of buildings deliberately left derelict. It may be helpful to the Committee if I quote Section 117(1) of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1971, because the new</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>176</span>
	<p>and waste. The courts have long recognised that there is a problem of someone who does nothing when something should be done.</p>
	<p>The Clause is not in any way a penal Clause and the less penal its provisions are, the more we like it. What the hon. Gentleman is seeking to do is to provide help so that local authorities may go into a building to prevent it from becoming an eysore, to prevent it from falling down, to do so at an early stage and, if necessary, to assist the local authority directly from Government grant as distinct from having to go to the owner of the building to get the necessary money. If that is the hon. Gentleman's intention, the Opposition will certainly give their support.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put</i>, That the Clause be read a Second time:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 8, Noes 8.</p>
	<p>Clause refers to it. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A council proposing to acquire a building compulsorily under section 114 of this Act, if they are satisfied that the building has been deliberately allowed to fall into disrepair for the purpose of justifying its demolition and the development or redevelopment of the site or any adjoining site, may include in the compulsory purchase order as submitted to the Secretary of State for confirmation an application for a direction for minimum compensation; and the Secretary of State, if he is so satisfied, may include such a direction in the order as confirmed by him."</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>The proposed new Clause, which incidentally was Clause 6 of my now defunct Urban and Rural Environment Bill, relates to what has become known as minimum compensation.</p>
	<p>The position is that under Section 53 of the 1968 Act, now Section 117 of the 1971 Act, the Minister has power to issue a certificate for minimum compensation when the owner of a listed building has let his building fall into a state of disrepair and it has been decided compulsorily to acquire it to prevent it from having to be demolished for public health reasons, or
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0547">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>177</span>
because it was in a dangerous condition. Speaking now more in hope than expectation, I hope to have the support of my hon. Friend the Minister on this new Clause, for there has been found to be—I hardly dare use the word again—a loophole in Section 117 of the 1971 Act in that courts have decided that fixtures in a building are not necessarily part of that building and that minimum compensation need not therefore be paid.</p>
	<p>I should add that I am not referring to furniture which is removable. By "fixture" I refer to interior parts of buildings such as a beautiful plaster ceiling, or a handsome Adam fireplace. It has been found that people can deliberately take these fixtures out and be able to claim compensation under the existing legislation.</p>
	<p>We have said many times in Committee that the beauty of a building is not only its structure but its adornment, whether externally—as pointed out by my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, South (Mr. Cooper), in one of his Amendments—or the internal parts, which are equally important and which may be the reason for its becoming listed.</p>
	<p>People can take these valuable fixtures from a building and still get proper compensation instead of minimum compensation. I am sure that that was not the intention of Section 53 of the 1968 Act, Section 117 of the present Act. New Clause No. 4 would close that loophole, and for those reasons I commend it to the Committee.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret that I cannot agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Handsworth (Mr. Sydney Chapman) when he says that the new Clause would stop people from removing valuable fixtures from the building. It would do nothing of the sort. It does not attack that abuse, if abuse it be. It deals merely with the case where someone deliberately allows a building to fall into decay for a certain purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The operation of Section 117 at present requires proof that the owner of a property has deliberately allowed it to fall into disrepair. It is difficult enough to interpret the word "deliberately" in the Section as it stands. One then has to go on one step further and prove that that conduct on the part of an owner was for the purpose of justifying demolition and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>178</span>
redevelopment of the site. Again, it would be difficult enough to prove that someone was or was not doing something in such a case, that he was neglecting to keep the property standing for a certain purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are grave difficulties in the Section as it stands, and I should be hesitant to add even more difficult words suggested by the new Clause. My hon. Friend seeks to add an alternative purpose, that if a person deliberately allows a building to fall into disrepair, either for the purpose of obtaining its value on development after demolition, or for obtaining the value of fixtures, fittings, or the fabric of the building—as in the case of chapels—the local authority would be entitled not only to take over the property by compulsory acquisition—as it could at any time with a listed building—but to take it over at a reduced value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By accepting the new Clause we should be complicating an already difficult Section and not meeting the abuse referred to by my hon. Friend—the removal of fixtures from a listed building. If that is to be done, it should be done in some way other than by amending Section 117. We should cause great difficulty in future in the interpretation of Section 117 if we accepted the new Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's usually clear mind is becoming somewhat fogged. The new Clause does not, in fact, do anything to complicate the issue: it makes it simpler. The complication to which the Minister referred already exists. It is the word "deliberately". That is what one has to prove. If one can get over the hurdle of deliberately letting something fall into dereliction, it would make it easier that one could show that it was done for the purpose of removing fixtures, fittings, or fabric, as the hon. Gentleman said. It does not make it more difficult. The Minister in his normally translucent moments would be able to see that as well as the rest of us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One does not need, then, to allow the property to fall into disrepair in order to do that. My hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is aware of the problem. Is he willing to look at the matter again to see whether the hon. Member's point could be met, because clearly it ought to be met? If the Minister would give us that not unreasonable undertaking, I should suggest that the hon. Member for Birmingham, Handsworth should withdraw his new Clause. If such an undertaking is not given, I hope that the hon. Member will not withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will certainly give the undertaking. I indicated earlier that I would look at the problem of clearly distinguishing between valuable fixtures and chattels. We know what in law constitutes a fixture and part of the freehold and what does not. If there is no protection against someone removing parts of the building in that way, the matter ought to be carefully studied, and I will study it. I cannot say off the record whether any protection exists in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It will be within the memory of the Committee that at an earlier stage I spoke against Clause 5 and sought to secure its deletion. As Clause 5 remains in the Bill, I seek by my new Clause to improve the working of that Clause, although we realise that it is the ultimate intention of the Government to abandon office devel-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0549">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

opment control altogether in five years' time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will be aware that the procedures for O.D.P.S and so on are that application must be made before any planning consent may be obtained. It seems to me that we are talking about the chicken and the egg. First, an applicant must incur some expense to obtain an O.D.P. If it is granted, he must obtain planning approval. Such approval may be refused. All the work has therefore been done unnecessarily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make no apology for relating this matter to the problems of the Greater London Council, which has special problems by virtue of its size and the great powers which it possesses. It is the strategic planning authority for a vast area. The new Clause seeks to allow a developer to apply for planning permission from the Greater London Council, or his local council, and, having obtained such approval, to apply for his O.D.P. If it suits his needs best, however, to apply for the O.D.P. first and take the risk of not receiving planning approval from the planning authority, he may take that risk. The new Clause gives the developer the choice between the two procedures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, South (Mr. Cooper) has called this a question of the chicken and the egg. I do not think that it is even that: I think that he has put the cart before the horse. At present, in law an application for planning permission for development, including office development, is of no effect unless it is accompanied by an office development permit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new Clause would substitute a provision that planning permission, including office development, would be of no effect unless an office development permit had either been obtained, or was subsequently produced to the local planning authority. I cannot imagine why anyone in their senses would want to do it that way round. The application for an office development permit is made in an informal manner. Application is made to staff in my Department, who discuss it thoroughly with the applicant in an informal way. They eventually come to a decision and inform the applicant of the reasons for the decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While that is taking place, it is open to the applicant to go the planning officer
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>182</span>
and say, "I am applying for an office development permit. What do you think about it from the planning point of view?" The informal procedure of obtaining an office development permit is much better done first, before going through all the procedure of planning, submitting the plans to the local planning authority and so on, which is an expensive process in many cases and certainly a very expensive process when there is substantial office development. I cannot understand any developer who would want to take that course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend's answer to that no doubt is that all he is doing is allowing a developer, if he wishes to do it that way round, to do so. But if a developer chose to do it that way, got his planning permission, sought an office development permit, and was refused that permit, there would be an abortive and ineffective planning permission in existence. Some of the planning permissions for development in London were suspended in 1965 by the introduction of office control legislation and they have still not been rendered effective. I should not like to add to uncertainty among the planning authorities and the public by creating yet another category of unusable planning permissions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot imagine anybody wanting to use it this way round, but even if he did, there would be grave danger of having ineffective planning permissions on the books of local authorities. Therefore, I ask the Committee to resist the new Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is another tidying-up proposal. Detailed amendments to structure plans have to go through a complicated procedure and great delays may occur. The effect of the new Clause is not to alter that procedure for important amendments to a structure plan, but to deal with relatively minor matters when it would be a waste of time, effort and money to go through the procedures laid down for Amending a structure plan. The new Clause enables an authority to amend a structure plan and at the same time gives the Minister power to step in if he thinks that there is something contrary to the public interest involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an extremely attractive proposition because it would enable my Department to streamline the procedure for structure plans. Indeed, we have been searching in many ways to streamline the procedure on planning development as well as on planning control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier in the Bill, we instituted an entirely new procedure for dealing with structure plans. When one is starting out on experimental procedure of that sort, there are grave doubts among those who
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>184</span>
will have to take part and among the public in general about whether there are sufficient safeguards. It is a procedure by which we are endeavouring to produce some speed in the examination of the plans and a concentration of effort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been asked by professional bodies, amenity societies and local authorities whether we are not going too far in excluding issues at the examination of the structure plan, or excluding persons from making their representations when that structure plan is considered—I am dealing with the original examination of the structure plan. But the same considerations arise when there is an alteration to a structure plan. It may be substantial or small, but whichever it is it may affect some part of the public in that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the new procedure we have deliberately made two compulsory provisions: first, the Secretary of State must consider all objections; secondly, he must hold an examination in public of the structure plan. It is those two statutory obligations which have satisfied people that the Government are not depriving the public of any rights of being heard, but just trying to concentrate on the real issues in the structure plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we removed either of those statutory obligations in connection with alterations to a structure plan, I fear that there might be doubt among the public. People might feel that by a stroke of the pen public participation in the study of the structure plan was being removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to find a distinction between substantial alteration and minor alteration and be able to leave it to the Secretary of State, so that if there were no issues in the alteration of the plan, he would be able to say so and not have to hold an examination in public. However, at this stage in the experimental procedure I do not think that the public would trust the Secretary of State not to be depriving somebody of his rights and I should not like him to be doubted in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, we must go through the process, where there is even a minor alteration to the structure plan, of a public examination of that alteration. The examination may take five minutes, but we have to give an opportunity to the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V003P0I0551">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>185</span>
public to comment on it. From that point of view, it would not be a farce in any way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I commend my hon. Friend for bringing this suggestion before the Committee and trying to assist us to deal with structure plans in a streamlined, efficient and expedient way, in the circumstances of introducing a new Procedure we must stick to the two statutory obligations on the Secretary of State even when he is considering alterations to a structure plan and not merely when he is considering the original structure plan.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 37, in Schedule 2, page 18, line 3, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>() Every local authority with whom a copy of any direction is deposited under paragraph 5 above shall compile and keep available for public inspection free of charge at reasonable hours and at a convenient place a list containing particulars of any building in their area to which the direction relates.</p></blockquote>
It is provided in Scotland that a local authority is to keep a list, at a convenient place and at that authority free for inspection by members of the public at reasonable times, of all the buildings listed in its area under Section 7. The English Section does not have a similar provision for such public inspection. What there is is contained in paragraph 6 of Part II of Schedule 2, which directs that on confirmation the order be registered in the register of local land charges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The register of local land charges is something known to the Minister, to my right hon. Friend, and to me. It is not generally known to members of the public. It is something to which solicitors refer on the buying and selling of land. It struck me that so often Scottish law is eminently preferable to English law, and this could be an example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>186</span>
If I am interested in historic buildings, or buildings of great beauty, and I am on holiday, why should I not be able to go to the local council office, not to enter a land charge register as if I were buying or selling property, to ask to see the list of the houses or premises that might be of interest to me. That seems sensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, if such a list were kept, it would benefit not only the traveller, but schools and other local people who wanted to see where the listed buildings were, possibly to take schoolchildren to see them. It would benefit future local historians, because records of the lists would be kept, and that would be of importance when compiling a local history. It could also be of interest to people doing research on ancient buildings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that my Amendment is not disfavoured by the Government. It seems a sensible way in which the public could be made aware, without the official jargon of a local land charge, of where the listed historic buildings in an area were. That is the position in Scotland, and my Amendment seeks to make it the same in England and Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) has said, if one wishes to know which buildings in Scotland have been subject to the direction of a conservation area, one looks at the list: in England one pays 15s. for a local search—it used to be 10s.—and has three weeks to wait for the result. The local authority would be astonished that one did not include the usual inquiries about where the drains were. One might have to wait longer after a letter asking why one had not asked for the usual information and why the right fee had not been sent, when all one wanted to know was whether a building was subject to a direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is considerable merit in the proposal that a comprehensive list should be held by the local authority and open to public inspection. Information given in this form would be more accessible to the public than it would be in the local land charges register. It may be a coincidence that this last Amendment which we shall be debating today, although others will be put, is on a question of some publicity.
