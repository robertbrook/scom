	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to detain the Committee long because I hope that we shall have a very fruitful day and deal with most of these matters, but I wish to speak on behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for Reading (Dr. Vaughan) who is particularly concerned about certain things in the Bill and has asked me to advance his cause for him this morning. Having discussed the matter with him at some length, I am very happy to do this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a letter to me some weeks ago, my hon. Friend pointed out that the Berkshire
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0465">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>851</span>
people would like to include the whole of the Slough and Henley areas as set out in the letter from the clerk which went to all members of the Committee on 22nd November. I am sure that my hon. Friends and hon. Members opposite will remember this letter because it was much more forcefully expressed than many of those which he received, and was sent out by the Clerk himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
His concluding sentence was:
	<br><q><p>"The Council earnestly hope that the members of the Standing Committee will accept these representations and that the Local Government Bill be amended accordingly"</p></q>
My hon. Friend points out to me that these areas of Slough and Henley were regarded in the White Paper, and before that by the Redcliffe-Maud Commission, as essential parts of the new county. I am not suggesting, nor is my hon. Friend, that the whole areas should necessarily be clipped. My hon. Friend, however, is not at all clear what has made the Government change their view. If they are not prepared to accept the larger area, we would urge that at least the parishes mentioned in the Amendments, to which my hon. Friend and I have put our names should be included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They are either parishes which are continuous with the built-up areas of Reading and Slough or, from planning, health and general administrative points of view, so closely connected that it is really rather silly not to include them. But failing all this, there are six parishes which it really would be very strange indeed not to include, because they are part of either Reading or Slough. The parishes concerned are Taplow, Burnham, Farnham Royal—which all connect with the west end of Slough—and Eye and Dunsden, Kidmore End and Mapledurham which all connect with Reading. Burnham and Mapledurham have repeatedly asked to be included in Berkshire, and Oxfordshire has always agreed that it would make sense for Kidmore End to be included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend sent me many documents to support his case and I shall not weary the Committee by quoting from all of them, but I should like to refer to one which came out as a statement from the leader of the majority group on the Berkshire County Council just before Christmas, in which it is pointed out:
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>852</span>
	<br><q><p>"The people of Burnham, the largest parish in the Eton Rural District area, have most forcefully expressed their wish to be included in the new Berkshire, which is a logical place for them to be. Yet they are left out. Farnham Royal, mainly a built-up area forming an integral part of the Slough unit, has been thrust into another county. Stoke Poges, Iver and Wexham are also contiguous to Slough, yet the first two have been sundered from it, while the last has actually been cut in half by the boundary."</p></q>
The statement goes on in similar vein and concludes:
	<br><q><p>"We feel that the wishes and needs of the people should not be ignored, and we shall work through our Council to try to put this matter right. We shall fight for our cause in every way open to us while the Bill is with the Commons and, if necessary, in the Lords and before the proposed Boundaries Commission."</p></q>
It is because of this extremely strong local feeling which my hon. Friend has forcefully illustrated to me that I speak on his behalf this morning. He pointed out to me that in his first announcement the Minister indicated that he was prepared to make local alterations in the boundaries which would result in better administration, which would not divide local communities and which would respect the wishes of local people. Already in the Committee we have had many illustrations of the flexible approach so sensibly adopted by the Minister. I hope, therefore, that he will consider carefully the points that I have put forward on behalf of my hon. Friend and that he will give a helpful and satisfactory answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evelyn King</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is one of the curiosities of the procedure inevitably bound up with this Committee that I find myself at least technically opposing two of my hon. Friends on behalf of a third hon. Friend. My hon. Friend the Member for Henley (Mr. Hay) has asked me to make clear that there is opposition to what has been proposed, and that that opposition is substantial. The aggrandisement of Berkshire cannot be regarded as acceptable to those who live in Henley or Oxford.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendments detach from Oxfordshire two sets of parishes adjoining the Thames and put them into Berkshire. There is opposition to both Amendments from Henley Borough and Rural Council and from every parish council in the area, with the exception of Mapledurham. It is also opposed by the Oxford County Council. The Amendments put down by my hon. Friend are highly controversial
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0466">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>853</span>
and bitterly resented by the County of Oxfordshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also denied that Henley looks to Reading for shopping, for culture, or for entertainment; it looks in the reverse direction. When claims of territorial aggrandisement are made, it must also be relevant to look at the existing situation, which is that Berkshire already has a population of 612,000 and rateable value of £37½ million, whereas poor, downtrodden Oxford has a population of only 503,000 and rateable value of £22½ million. On those grounds it would not be reasonable to make Oxford the poorer in order to make Berkshire the richer. Those are the points that I was asked to make. When the Minister replies, I hope that he will consider no less the representations that I have made on behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for Henley than those made by the hon. Member for Reading (Dr. Vaughan).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say a brief word on behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for Abingdon (Mr. Neave), who has written to me on a number of occasions with regard to these Amendments. His concern is about a number of parishes in the southern part of the area of the Henley Urban District Council. From what he has told me, I confirm that all the parishes in question wish to remain in Oxfordshire. There was some slight doubt about Mapledurham, but there is a letter from Mr. Jones, the clerk of the parish council, which says very emphatically that if Henley Rural District Council area were to be administered from Oxfordshire, which is what is proposed in the Bill, Mapledurham does not wish to be split up in any way but to remain as an integral part of the Henley area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Buckinghamshire, South (Mr. Bell) is of such judgment and stature that his word on a matter of this sort will almost certainly be accepted by my hon. Friends the Member for Crosby (Mr. Graham Page) and the Member for Tavistock (Mr. Michael Heseltine). What he proposes is, without doubt, as sensible a group of Amendments as anything that has been argued in the Committee since its inception, and there have been many sensible arguments put forward by hon. Members on both sides. The Amendments to which I refer are Amendments Nos.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>854</span>
208, 209 and 210. In this case, for once, we shall not be in any sort of geographical or historical muddle, neither shall we be trying to move about on the map vast numbers of human beings to suit the tidiness of anybody at all. We shall be saying something that everybody in the country will understand, and this is more than can be said of some of the moves made in Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose here is to try to stop Buckinghamshire being cut up towards its southern part by taking out Slough and all parts south of Slough. Geographically and historically, this is nonsense, for the one boundary that everyone in this part of the world, and I suppose the whole of England, understands is the boundary of the Thames. The effect of these three Amendments would be to maintain the old traditional boundary of the Thames as the southernmost boundary of Buckinghamshire. This seems to me to be the most reasonable request that has been made to this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to take up more than a minute or two of the Committee's time, but I do want to mention one historical fact. It is a foolish politician who has no regard to history and I cannot do better than quote the words of my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Buckinghamshire, South (Mr. Bell) when he spoke in that original debate:
	<br><q><p>"These areas"</p></q>
—that is, the areas to which I am referring in Buckinghamshire—
	<br><q><p>"have been in Buckinghamshire for nearly 1,100 years—from the time that Buckinghamshire came into existence as part of the Kingdom of Mercia. When hon. Members get tired of waiting to be called in this place, they apply for the Chiltern Hundreds. I have them in the sense that I represent two of them."</p></q>
—that is, my hon. and learned Friend represents two of the Chiltern Hundreds.
	<br><q><p>"It is proposed to wrench away the southern part of two of the Chiltern Hundreds—the House has often heard the phrase: 'Her Majesty's Chiltern Hundreds in the County of Buckinghamshire'—which have been in Buckinghamshire for over 1,000 years, and to put them in Berkshire where they do not want to go. Why? I am utterly at a loss to know."</p></q>
May I add to that small mention on the historical side one other point, namely the wishes of local people, which are far more important than the wishes of the geographers or the tidy-minded, who want to cut everything up into little strips and make sure that everything runs east to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0467">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>855</span>
west and north to south and tie it up in little bundles and put them into pigeonholes. Who better to speak for the wishes of the people of Buckinghamshire, South than the hon. and learned Gentleman who represents them and has, I believe, for 21 years:
	<br><q><p>"I can speak for the people in the Eton rural district. I have represented them for over twenty-one years, I live in the constituency, and therefore I feel that I know what they want. They are overwhemingly opposed to this change. I know that my right hon. Friend will have been deluged with complaints and objections from public and private bodies, individuals and societies. Everybody has been horrified by this suggestion. I ask him to believe that any idea that the people of the southern part of South Buckinghamshire think in terms of Reading and Berkshire is absurd."</p></q>
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally my hon. and learned Friend said:
	<br><q><p>"If I had been asked, which I was not, I could have told him"</p></q>
—that is, my hon. Friend—
	<br><q><p>"exactly what the reaction of my constituents would be. I could have told him that they worked in and travelled to London. I could have told him that Reading and Berkshire were nothing in their lives and that to replace the Thames by the A40, the road to Oxford, which cuts through the communities of the area, so that we lose the wonderful boundary of the biggest river in England and get instead a road which threads its sinuous way along and across streets was high summer madness. But nobody asked me."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 19th May, 1971; Vol. 817, 	<i>cc.</i> 1358–59.]</p></q>
I, therefore, ask my hon. Friends if they will kindly resist the further emasculation of Buckinghamshire, bearing in mind that the Minister has been most kind and helpful in that he has already reclaimed much of what was suggested in the White Paper. Can we have the rest reclaimed and come to the sensible boundary of the Thames?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Michael Heseltine)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The opinions expressed by my four hon. Friends in this debate make clear the very strongly felt views held by many of the people living in the parishes which have been mentioned this morning. Undoubtedly, I would agree with what they have said. In each of the areas that we are considering there has been deep feeling, and firmly expressed representations have been made to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I can deal with the Amendments as they have been presented to us.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>856</span>
First, there is the group of Amendments introduced by my hon. Friend the Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack) on behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for Reading (Dr. Vaughan). He dealt with the parishes to the north of Reading within the County of Oxfordshire. The various Amendments here provide us with a series of options as to the number of parishes to be moved across the county boundary to join Reading. I do not think that it is necessary to list the various parishes which would be included in any particular selection we may make so long as one accepts the general principle that urban development associated with Reading has spread into Oxfordshire and that there is in many ways a direct relationship between Reading and that urban development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend pointed out, the original proposals published in our Consultative Document assumed that we would do a certain amount of tidying up at this time in order to bring those communities into one authority. But there was very strong representation from the parishes concerned and from the Oxfordshire County Council that this did not conform to the necessities of the moment and would be better dealt with with the procedures outlined for the Boundary Commission at a later date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, having considered the matter and listened to the arguments, I have come to the broad conclusion that it probably needs another, cooler look; I use the word advisedly, because I think that passions have been inflamed in the matter. My personal view, which I hope my hon. Friends will accept, is that it would be right to leave the matter as it stands so that the Boundary Commission may come to terms with it in the way that we shall be discussing later in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it is fair to say that Oxfordshire County Council itself, whilst it strongly resists the kind of Amendment now proposed, realises that some adjustment will be necessary and feels strongly that it would be much better done by the Boundary Commission. I hope that that will be the way in which the exercise will be carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next group of Amendments on which I would like to comment are those referred to by my hon. Friends the Members for Dorset, South (Mr. Evelyn King),
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0468">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>857</span>
Northants, South (Mr. Arthur Jones) and Yarmouth (Mr. Fell), in which they looked at the situation on the east of the County of Berkshire, where the controversy surrounds the decision as to what is to be done with Slough. I think that is the first and crucial decision that must be made, whether the situation should be retained whereby Slough is now in Buckinghamshire or whether it should be linked with the territory to its south, or to the East-West links which it is building up very rapidly with London and Reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The overwhelming view of the population, as represented to their local authorities, is that Slough very firmly wishes to make the change that is proposed in the Bill. I think it is right to say that whereas the view of the major local authorities is that this change should be made, in fact the surrounding smaller authorities feel equally strongly that no such change should be made. When we first published our proposals in the Consultative Document, we envisaged a much larger switch of territory, involving the neighbouring parishes to the north of Slough, and it was this that provoked such hostile comment from the people involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Bill as now published we have very tightly drawn the boundary of Slough, so that the only northern transfer beyond the metropolitan borough itself is a small adjustment in the parish of Wexham. This was deliberately drawn in order to include a local hospital for Slough. Otherwise the parishes to the north have been left in the County of Buckinghamshire, which is what they wanted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Cannock (Mr. Cormack) referred to local opinion, and I have here the views of the Burnham Parish Council, in which it makes it absolutely clear now, though it did hold a different view earlier, that it has no wish to enter the County of Berkshire under the present arrangements in the Bill. We have to make it absolutely clear that the smaller authorities are overwhelmingly in favour of the proposal as published, with the exception of those small authorities to the south of Slough, which are landlocked. If one makes the decision to transfer Slough southwards from Buckinghamshire into Berkshire, there is no choice but to move those
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>858</span>
parishes—I think there were four of them—because there is no way of connecting them, as they are at present connected, with the county to the north.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friends will feel that we have tried to make the minimum disruption in the present pattern of authority boundaries, compatible with the very important decision as to what to do with Slough. Having taken the decision about Slough, we have tried to accede to the wishes of the local people where-ever possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept at once that the right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) has tried to anticipate some of the problems that we face in looking at local authorities' territories and finding that they do not make sense in terms of the spread of population, which might embrace very different sorts of population within a local authority territory, some of which should associate themselves with Slough, and others to the north to the Chilterns. He therefore has put down what are modest Amendments—Amendments Nos. 368 and 376, which simply take a very thin sliver out of Slough along its western and north-western boundary, and then add to Berkshire the closely built-up area comprising the wards of Britwell East and Britwell West, in Burn-ham Parish, due north of Slough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think this is the sort of dilemma which I would not want to deny exists. It is our view that this would perhaps be best dealt with by the Boundary Commission who can look at it—perhaps not looking at ward boundaries which may not be completely right in the circumstances—in the calmer atmosphere which I think will return to this area as soon as we have dealt with the Bill itself and the Boundary Commission is able to get under way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, whilst understanding the arguments put forward for the sort of changes that are argued in these Amendments, and whilst admitting that undoubtedly the Boundary Commission will want to deal with many of these arguments, my hon. Friends and hon. Members opposite will feel that we could leave the boundaries as they are now drawn as those which are likely to commend themselves most to the majority of people affected and to cause the minimum disruption compatible with this reorganisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cocks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to address myself particularly to Amendments No. 512 and 508 out of this group, which deal with the Urban District of Haverhill and some of the parishes in Clare Rural District.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure the Committee will appreciate that as a Bristol Member, I really have no personal interest in this area. In fact, the nearest I ever got to it was attending a harvest camp in Lincolnshire during the war. But I am moving these Amendments in the interests of the people of the area because I feel that the Committee should have an opportunity of considering the case. I know that hon. Members have received briefs from local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be extremely interested in the Minister's reply, because, since I undertook to move this change, I have yet to find any cogent reason why this change should have been proposed. We have in the past, in our discussions on these boundaries, had arguments in which one could say it was a case of tradition versus new patterns of transport, employment, various branches of social science, and so on, and a balance had to be struck between these two. As far as I can see, both the traditional links and all the new changes that have taken place, particularly since the war, point in the same direction. So, as I say, the Minister's reply is awaited with great interest. I cannot
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>860</span>
adduce any single reason why it should have been proposed that these areas should be taken out of West Suffolk and transferred to Cambridgeshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yesterday or the day before hon. Members received a substantial brief with regard to representations from West Suffolk County Council, East Suffolk County Council and Ipswich County Borough. It expressed very great concern over the proposal to remove Haverhill and these parishes from Clare Rural District. It also mentioned the parishes of Kent-ford and Moulton, but I do not wish to deal with these at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They say in their brief, which I shall not use extensively because other members of the Committee already have it, that this area of Haverhill has been a substantial growth area and that there is no overriding planning reason for moving it to Cambridgeshire. In fact, they say that all the planning considerations point towards it remaining in Suffolk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The council mentions that attempts have been 'made to make out a case for this suggestion, alleging various links with Cambridge city. These are said to be much exaggerated. Indeed, if the Minister, with the map that he has before him, would look at the shape of the parishes to the west of the area that we are discussing and in the Clare rural district, he will see that there is a basic change between the two areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These geographical patterns point to the fact that Cambridgeshire, on the edge of the Fens, is entirely different in traditions and settlement patterns from the area under discussion, which is historically much more closely related to the area to the east and the north-east. If one looks back over the past one sees that there is no real basis for this, and the wishes of the people have been strongly expressed through their elected representatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise very strongly the point about town development. Not only is it pointed out that the Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely County Council has laid no claim to Haverhill; it is also said that if Haverhill does not wish to be transferred to Cambridgeshire that council would not wish such a transfer to take place. Indeed, in the evidence which it submitted to the Redcliffe-Maud Royal Commission in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0470">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>861</span>
volume 11, Cambridgeshire and the Isle of Ely submitted a resolution of the council of October, 1966, which said
	<br><q><p>"That the Royal Commission be informed that it is considered there is nothing basically wrong with the structure of local government and that the County Council have tested public opinion at recent inquiries and are satisfied that public opinion is opposed to larger authorities."</p></q>
That is not encouraging to an area like Haverhill, which is so newly developing and rapidly growing that it must have special consideration with regard to new planning interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to quote from a letter submitted by South Cambridgeshire Rural District Council to the Clerk of West Suffolk County Council on this point, saying that his council could
	<br><q><p>"well understand and sympathise with the fears of Haverhill that their interests are likely to be subordinated to those of the wider, but more populous in total, interests of the remainder of the area.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>"Looking at the matter geographically it is apparent that Haverhill would benefit by remaining in Suffolk in association with the less predominantly rural areas adjacent thereto."</p></q>
It goes on to mention that the council is well aware
	<br><q><p>"that there is now a well established rapport between your County Council and Haverhill in connection with town expansion and … think it would be a pity to break this and have to start afresh with a new County Council that has not had the same experience of this kind of work."</p></q>
That is a very telling letter, and I put it before the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other local authorities have supported the case, including the Chesterton Rural District Council, which also accepts that
	<br><q><p>"there are very good reasons … in relation to Local Government … why Haverhill should remain in Suffolk ".</p></q>
It goes even further, it says that
	<br><q><p>"its proposed inclusion in Cambridgeshire appears to be contrary to the Government's own criteria as set out in the White Paper on re-organisation."</p></q>
If the wish of the people not to be transferred is so strong, and no compelling case has been made out for the change, why should that wish be ignored? The Minister will recall that in their White Paper the Government said that wherever possible existing county boundaries would be retained, in order to maintain maximum loyalty and minimise administrative problems. It seems to the people on the ground that that area is very much-the odd one out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>862</span>
The evidence to the Royal Commission, again in 1966, volume 11, paid tribute to West Suffolk as being a forward-looking and well administered county. The administrative centre at Bury St. Edmunds is said to be well situated to cover the whole administrative county, all parts of which are within reach of Shire Hall. There is, therefore, a strong case to be made on the grounds that I have mentioned and also a strong administrative case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The West Suffolk evidence went on to point out that there had been rapid expansion in the area. There is an existing population of 143,000, an a projection for 1981 of 238,000 as a result of the town expansion schemes linking West Suffolk to the outer metropolitan region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of arguments have been put forward why Haverhill should be linked with Cambridge, but my information is that these are shallow, almost spurious, points, and relate to such matters as people regarding Cambridge as the regional shopping centre. A local survey shows that most Haverhill people shop in Haverhill itself, and that if they undertake weekend or monthly shopping excursions they are just as likely to go to Bury St. Edmunds as to Cambridge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Entertainment and hospitals have been dealt with in the brief which hon. Gentlemen have received, as has transport. The arguments linking Haverhill with Cambridgeshire on transport grounds are the most spurious of all. Recent Departmental studies on rural transport, one of which took place in West Suffolk, show that only about 7 per cent. of the population use public transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the whole question of transport and employment, it is interesting to note that map 15, which was published in one of the booklets accompanying the Royal Commission's Report, the boundary of the catchment area centred on Cambridge and enclosing local authority areas with 500 or more residents working in employment centres, does not include this area of West Suffolk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may say that although the map does not include this area there is, nevertheless, a strong current in favour of this change, even though it may not be strong enough to be traced. Appendix 2 of volume 3 of the Research Appendices, having said that the map shows the principal catchment areas of the main
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0471">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>863</span>
employment centres in the country, continues: "The chief areas not included in them are Cornwall, Devon, Somerset, West Suffolk, West Norfolk, parts of Lincolnshire", and one or two others. So, although West Suffolk is not mapped here, it is a sufficiently important work catchment area to merit mention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To sum up, this area is expanding, and it is linked to a county council which is well briefed and well versed in the problems of planning and development. For no apparent reason it is proposed to place it in a county which does not particularly want it, and which has little experience of the problems of growth areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Appendix 3, Table 2, of Research Appendices, entitled "Migration and changes, relative to England outside Greater London", deals with the migration of males. It shows that in 1961 West Suffolk came third out of the 45 counties listed, with a net migration of 10.93 per cent. On the other hand Cambridgeshire and the Isle of Ely, to which it is proposed to transfer thriving Haverhill, ranked 39th out of 45, with a rate of 2.46 per cent. Only six counties had a lower figure, three having a negative index.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise to the Minister for not presenting a fuller case, but it is not an area with which I am familiar. Such information as I have been able to obtain points inexorably to the fact that in this case the Minister should be asked to think again and let the Committee know the thinking that lies behind this proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before resuming the debate may I remind the Committee that I said that we could discuss in this Amendmend the various Amendments set out on the provisional selection of Amendments, and I added Amendment No. 515, on page 1151, in the name of the hon. Member for Sudbury and Wood-bridge (Mr. Stainton). It is a starred Amendment, but, with the consent of the Committee, I think that it would be convenient to take it with these Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the Amendment in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South (Mr. Michael Cocks), and I should like to move Amendment No. 509 on behalf of the hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only difference between Amend-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>864</span>
ment No. 509 and the other Amendment which affects Clare Rural District is that it keeps the four parishes nearest to Haverhill with Haverhill in Suffolk, and allows the other parishes to be transferred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I point out to the hon. Member that it is not necessary to move the Amendment. It is being discussed with the others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Sir Stephen. On behalf of the hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge I draw the Committee's attention to the fact that the four villages of Kedington, Little Wratting, Great Wratting and Withersfield, are close to Haverhill, and should therefore remain with Haverhill in Suffolk. If the Minister wishes to make a case for dividing the Clare Rural District and taking some of the parishes into Cambridgeshire, albeit against their will, he must make a case for not limiting the transfer to the parishes in the north of the area, as proposed in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support what my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South said about this proposed transfer from Suffolk into Cambridgeshire. No arguments have been put forward to justify it. Haverhill is an expanding town, and there is a tripartite agreement between the county council, the district council and the Greater London Council. There are, of course, other expanding towns in Suffolk. The officials of the Suffolk County Council have a great deal of experience in dealing with the problems of expanding towns, and from experience in my constituency where a new town is being built I know how important that is. There are unique problems in expanding and new towns. The officials of these local authorities require a certain amount of experience. I understand that there are no expanding towns in Cambridgeshire, and that its officials do not have experience on the scale of that gained in Suffolk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend dealt with transport. It is true that more buses run from Haverhill to Cambridge than from Haverhill to Bury St. Edmunds, but that is not surprising, because the garage is in Cambridge. It does, however, cost more to go by bus from Haverhill to Cambridge than it does to go from Haverhill to Bury St. Edmunds. Indeed, as my hon. Friend said,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0472">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>865</span>
few people use public transport in that part of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The survey which has been conducted shows that only 7 per cent. of people there use public transport. That is an important sector of the community but it is, nevertheless, a minority. That figure of 7 per cent. represents people using buses going in both directions. Only 20 people a day use public transport to get to work in Cambridge. The transport connection is therefore not conclusive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, it is true, a connection with the hospital for Cambridgeshire, but a new hospital is being built at Bury St. Edmunds. It is expected that Haverhill people will use that hospital, and I dare say it has been designed on that basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On educational grounds, too, this proposal is against the interests of the people of Haverhill and the Clare Rural District. People from Clare go to Haverhill for their education. It would be against their interests to transfer this part of Suffolk to Cambridgeshire. Haverhill has already switched to a middle school system, as has the whole of the West Suffolk County Council area. Cambridgeshire, on the other hand, has pioneered a form of organisation in education known as the village college. It is, I believe, unique to Cambridgeshire. It is an important experiment, but it will make it difficult for Haverhill to be fitted in to the Cambridgeshire educational system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The overwhelming argument is one of democracy. Nobody has come forward to support the transfer from Suffolk into Cambridgeshire. The West Suffolk County Council is adamantly opposed to it, as is East Suffolk County Council. They wish to retain Haverhill and the Clare Rural District in their county. Cambridgeshire County Council lays no claim to Haverhill. It does not wish it to be transferred to the county. Indeed, opinion is overwhelmingly against the transfer. Cambridgeshire County Council accepts that view and accepts, too, that the wishes of the people of Haverhill should be paramount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The opinion of Haverhill people can be shown by looking at their urban district council. The composition of that council is seven Labour councillors, two Independent, two Conservative, with one vacancy. When a resolution was put to a meeting of the council, all but one councillor voted for opposition to the transfer.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>866</span>
They were almost unanimously opposed to the transfer. The one Conservative councillor who did not oppose the transfer abstained. Not one councillor, of any parly, supported the transfer from Suffolk to Cambridgeshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the parish councils of the rural districts have also opposed this transfer, where they have been able to express an opinion. Some have not expressed any opinion, but none of the parish councils has come forward to support the transfer to Cambridgeshire. The Clare Rural District Council opposes the division of its district, as it does the transfer to Cambridgeshire. As my hon. Friend said, the Cambridgeshire rural district councils oppose the transfer. Indeed, some of the Cambridgeshire parish councils oppose the transfer being made against the wishes of the people of Haverhill. As far as I can discover no one, with the sole exception of the hon. Member for Bury St. Emunds (Mr. Eldon Griffiths) has publicly supported this transfer. His hon. Friend the Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton), from another part of Suffolk, is also opposed to the transfer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position is that only the parliamentary representative for the area, the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds, has come out in support of this transfer. No one else in the whole of Suffolk is prepared to support this proposal. Nobody from Haverhill is prepared to support the transfer, and I think the Minister must do a great deal to convince us that there is a justification for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Development (Mr. Graham Page)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government must pay keen attention to the expressed wishes of the local authorities in this area, and they have been very well put forward by the hon. Member for Bromsgrove (Mr. Terry Davis). When we first came to consider this matter, leading up to the drafting of the Bill, we placed the whole of Clare Rural District and Haverhill in the county of Cambridge. When I attended a meeting at Ipswich, Suffolk, various representations were made to me on that occasion about this corner of Suffolk—Haverhill and Clare Rural District. As a result of that meeting I carefully considered the whole question and, while being con-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0473">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>867</span>
vinced that Haverhill really looked towards Cambridge rather than towards Bury St. Edmunds or Ipswich, I did not think that it was necessary to include the whole of Clare Rural District as an area of Haverhill influence. Thus, when the map was drawn for the Bill the area to be moved from Suffolk into Cambridge was reduced to Haverhill plus ten parishes around Haverhill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To take first the argument put forward by the hon. Gentleman the Member for Bromsgrove, there is no doubt that all 10 parishes are within the area which considers itself part of Haverhill. It is arguable that one should draw the line more tightly—nearer to the town of Haverhill itself. That may be a judgment which ought to be referred later to the Boundary Commission. My own view, after studying this carefully, is that these 10 parishes knit together as part of the Haverhill area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bristol, South (Mr. Michael Cocks) called in aid the Redcliffe-Maud Report, but that put Haverhill with Cambridge, and the previous Government accepted that position in their White Paper. I think that they were right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not the case that the Report put other areas from Essex and Hertfordshire—Royston, for example—into Cambridgeshire, and that the Government have allowed the other two areas to remain in their present counties, insisting only on the transfer of Haverhill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is quite right to raise that point against me. It is only one small factor, which I was bringing in because the hon. Member for Bristol, South brought in Redcliffe-Maud. In none of these cases do I stand by Redcliffe-Maud; I turn to it for information, but not necessarily for decision or opinion. In this case the Report created the unitary authority of Cambridge and South Fens. I admit that it is not a strong argument for me that Redcliffe-Maud considered Haverhill as part of the Cambridge influence. I merely point that out as a fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recently the present Government have followed that line by setting up a sub-regional study of the area of Cambridge and Newmarket. We thought it right to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>868</span>
include Haverhill within the area of that study.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Bristol, South has said, it is a newly developing area, and we should study the trend of that development—the direction in which it is leaning. When we chose an area for this sub-regional study it seemed evident that Haverhill was looking economically towards Cambridge. As we said, it is a newly developing area but it is no longer dependent on its own expansion status; it has reached adult age and it is growing of its own volition. In doing so, its economic contacts are with Cambridge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Haverhill people are finding employment in Cambridge, which is the centre of many of the area's wholesale and distributive trades, and a Cambridge-linked firm is one of the town's largest employers. As other industries in Cambridge seek to expand they may well find new opportunities in Haverhill's town development programme. There is certainly more opportunity of expansion of industry from the Cambridge area than from Bury St. Edmunds or Ipswich.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both the hon. Gentlemen who spoke on the Amendment referred to the transport links. They rather scoffed at them, but we cannot ignore them. There is the very impressive link of 13 daily bus services, direct from Cambridge to Haverhill, and only one a week—as against 13 a day—to Bury St. Edmunds. As between the two towns, public transport shows an inclination for the people of Haverhill to travel into Cambridge rather than Bury St. Edmunds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Post Office and the hospital service both put Haverhill with their Cambridge organisations. For what it is worth, the Haverhill branch of the National Farmers Union is affiliated to the Cambridgeshire County Union. One searches for influences which Bury St. Edmunds or Ipswich may have on Haverhill. Apart from sentiment and tradition—and I do not underrate them—there is little economic, social or any other real link between Haverhill and the major towns of Suffolk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those in Haverhill turn to Cambridge for shopping and entertainment. The newspaper circulating in Haverhill is the 	<i>Cambridge News,</i> and not a paper from the Suffolk area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the basis of the general policy of making the future administrative frame-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0474">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>869</span>
work of local government coincide more closely with both economic planning and social considerations, we came to the conclusion that the right place for Haverhill, for its future growth and its overall development, should be in Cambridgeshire. That is how we have placed it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to what I said at the beginning. We have given great consideration to the views expressed by the authorities in this area but we are convinced that the right place for Haverhill, in terms of growth, is with the town which is so close to it, both geographically and economically.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must protest. No case has been made out by the hon. Gentleman. On his first point, about economic growth, it comes a little hard for the Government to tell the people of Haverhill that they should be transferred to Cambridgeshire because that is where economic growth will come. It is especially hard because in the 	<i>East Anglian Daily Times</i> of 28th May, 1971, there was a headline which said,
	<br><q><p>"Brake growth and opt for Cambridge, M.P. tells Haverhill."</p></q>
The Minister has said that Haverhill looks economically to Cambridge. "They may well find the opportunities there," he said. They would have to. According to the East and West Suffolk County Councils, on which there are very few Labour councillors—I do not think that anyone will accuse my party of controlling the county councils in Suffolk—on the subject of the economic connections between Haverhill and Cambridge, according to the Registrar General's Sample Census in 1966 only 1.16 per cent. of the town's population work in Cambridge. That clearly shows how little Haverhill is dependent upon Cambridge, and does not begin to justify a change of administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend has already said, Haverhill is not in the commuting catchment area of Cambridge. Since 1966, local industry in Haverhill has expanded, providing more jobs. If anything, the percentage is now lower than 1.16—lower than it was six years ago. Haverhill does not look to Cambridge for jobs. Out of its 12,500 people, 100 work in Cambridge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard about the transport links. The Minister really is scratching for a case. I am upset that he should do that. He must know that the Suffolk County
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>870</span>
Council say, on this subject of transport:
	<br><q><p>'This would seem to be one of the most fallacious arguments for suggesting the transfer of Haverhill to Cambridgeshire. It is based entirely on the use of buses."</p></q>
—and we have heard from the Minister that it is—
	<br><q><p>"and is unsupported by the facts.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>"To get matters into perspective the recent Departmental Studies on Rural Transport, one of which took place in West Suffolk, showed that only about 7 per cent. of the population used public transport."</p></q>
I draw your attention, Sir Stephen, to the phrase "use public transport"—not "use it to go to Cambridge".
	<br><q><p>"A social survey recently carried out by the county council using accepted sampling techniques showed that there is little difference in the numbers using public transport to travel to Bury St. Edmunds and Cambridge for shopping purposes. The number of people who visit these towns fortnightly or less by bus is the same in each case."</p></q>
The bus service may be less frequent, perhaps there are more people on the buses to Bury St. Edmunds; it is not surprising since the fares are lower.
	<br><q><p>"As to irregular travel, a survey by the bus operators last year indicated that no more than 20 people use the bus daily in order to get to work in Cambridge."</p></q>
Then the Minister referred to the Post Office. We are told that the Post Office puts Haverhill with Cambridge and therefore local government boundaries should be drawn on that basis. The Post Office puts Bromsgrove with Birmingham and I hope the Minister will not suggest that we should join Birmingham. We have more commuting from Chelmsley Wood into Birmingham than from Haverhill into Cambridge. Last week the Minister defended the case for keeping Chelmsley Wood out of Birmingham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are told that the 	<i>Cambridge News</i> circulates in Haverhill. I am not surprised; I believe it is a regional newspaper. Haverhill has its own newspapers—the 	<i>Haverhill Echo</i>—just as Bromsgrove and Redditch have their own newspapers. Surely, the Minister will not suggest that because the 	<i>Birmingham Post</i> is widely sold in my constituency, it should join the City of Birmingham. This is a nonsense. The Minister is reduced to saying that the only arguments for keeping Haverhill in Suffolk are based on sentiment and tradition. He did not

deal with hospitals or education or any of the arguments put forward by the people of Haverhill or the Suffolk County Council. He could not adduce one supporter for his point of view, other than the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must confess that it is always possible to tell from the expression on the Minister's face and the tone of his voice whether he really believes what he is saying, or whether he is making the best of a bad job. It is no secret in this Committee that today he has been making the best of a very bad job. He is always fair in his arguments. He tries to meet the points that are made against him, as I hope we all try to do to the best of our ability. Sometimes one does not meet the full force of a point, but perhaps the general scope of the argument is met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope I am not doing the hon. Gentleman an injustice, but he did not really attempt to meet the point that every single authority concerned here believes that the Government's proposals for Haverhill are totally wrong. Even Cambridgeshire believes it. The Minister is willing to offer them this magnificent free gift, this enormous growth area, the natural ally, the relative, the child of Cambridgeshire, and Cambridgeshire does not want it. This important argument that, in other proposals, has caused the Government to change their minds exists today and has not been answered properly by the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was impressed by the arguments of my hon. Friends the Members for Bristol, South (Mr. Michael Cocks) and Bromsgrove (Mr. Terry Davis). He had to be impressed by them because they are impressive arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one takes those four essential bases of community to decide whether or not this is a good or bad proposal, one comes up with one of the strongest arguments against the Government proposals that I have heard. If one takes the community of interest, there is not doubt about it. My hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove talked about the education difficulties that would arise, the links on education that exist already. It is a very clear point and one, incidentally, with which the Minister did not deal. My hon. Friend said, "Yes, we do understand that at the moment the hospitals of Cam-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>872</span>
bridgeshire are the ones that are used by Haverhill, but it will not always be so. Soon it will be Bury St. Edmunds". This was a most impressive point. It seems to me that a more impressive test of whether there is really a community of interest is where people go to hospital when they are ill, rather than where the General Post Office—a body that I do not regard as being of the highest efficiency—decides one ought to be for postal services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we come to transport, oh dear! This was one moment, above all others, when I felt intense sympathy with the Minister who, like myself, probably has not travelled on a bus in years. The Minister has his car; I walk. He says that he uses a bus frequently, but I do not think he uses the bus from Haverhill to Cambridge. If 13 services a day result in 20 people going from Haverhill to Cambridge, somebody ought to look at the bus services between Haverhill and Cambridge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidentally, whilst that research is going on, it would be interesting to know how many people travel from Bury St. Edmunds to Cambridge. I imagine rather more and, if that is so, it might be an argument for throwing Bury St. Edmunds into Cambridgeshire. So it goes on. Whatever it is, we are talking about a very small number of people and something that I should have thought went against the general trend. The negative argument here becomes positive because if only 20 people a day use a transport service there is no transport link between the two areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a little surprised, incidentally, by the lowness of these figures. I had the privilege and honour of studying in Cambridge for three wonderful years of my life and I should have thought that it was one of the most attractive cities in Britain. So, of course, are its graduates and undergraduates. Therefore, I should have thought that people in any area within 30, 40 even 50 miles would make a pilgrimage to Cambridge very frequently. I, therefore, find this figure of 20 a day a little depressing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So there is no transport link; the community of interest does not exist; the authorities do not want the link.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, we come to planning. My hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South raised the very important point that Haverhill itself was a growth area. In
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0476">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>873</span>
doing so, he did not link it with Cambridge. The Minister linked it in an odd sort of way with Cambridge, saying that there was an economic link between the two which would grow. From time to time when we on this side of the Committee have said to the Minister, "Look ahead a few years and you will see that there is an economic trend from one area to another. Therefore, agree with our Amendments", the Minister has said, "We will leave that to the Boundary Commission. I cannot possibly look that far ahead". Now he is looking ahead and he says that there is or will be this economic contact between the two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How is this economic contact measured? Is it not measured by where people work? My hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove made a strong point on this when he said that people from Haverhill do not work in Cambridge. I should have thought, and I hope that the Minister will think, that there is little likelihood of Cambridge increasing to such an extent that it is liable to act as a labour catchment point for all around the area that Cambridge will develop. We all know that in some ways it has developed rather too quickly. We also know that its narrow streets, its congestion, its one-way streets are one of the curses of Cambridge at this moment, but I would not believe that all is lost for Cambridge economically and from a planning point of view if Haverhill does not go to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any Bill of this kind there will be anomalies and unavoidable problems. They cannot be helped, and it would be ungracious to criticise. But this is an anomaly which can be criticised, because there is absolutely no reason for it. The Minister has not made a case that would convince the Minister. If he and I were talking together over a glass of whisky, as has been known, and neither of us was concerned with the Bill, we would both, as good lawyers interested in local government and planning, say that it was a nonsense. The recipient party does not want it, the authority of the area does not want it and the people do not want it. There is no contact. We cannot think what the Minister is doing to include it. That would be our reaction as ordinary people looking at it. I know how difficult it is to go back on what one has said, but I beg the Minister to tell the Committee that he will look at the matter
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>874</span>
again between now and Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see no harm in his doing this. He will agree that the case against is a powerful one. It is a case which convinced me because, as far as I can see from what the hon. Member for Bristol, South has said, I am the only member of the Committee who has not read the brief. Unfortunately, I have had no time to do so. I have listened to this absolutely cold. It seems an overwhelming case; it screams to common sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was not my intention to speak on this Amendment. But I would ask the Minister to promise to think again. If he does, I would ask my hon. Friends to withdraw the Amendment. Having listened to the case, if the Minister does not want to think again, we on this side, and I hope any hon. Members opposite, who may have been convinced, should press the Amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas Swain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am making a brief intervention in the debate and putting myself in the position of a juror. I have not had the oportunity of reading the brief, so I have been able to listen only to the presentation of the case and the defence of the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Listening to the presentation of the case by my hon. Friends and the Minister's defence, I find the case made by my hon. Friends is overwhelming; the defence put by the Minister, to say the least, was extremely weak. I sympathise with the Minister because, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) said, he was scratching about for answers. He was like an old hen with 24 chickens in a field with no grass in it. He did not know where to look for one answer. The Minister did not deal with one aspect in reality as presented by my hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are my conclusions as a member of the jury this morning, not having had the opportunity of studying the case in detail but knowing something about the area because I follow my pastime of fishing there. One point is that the councils in this area which my hon. Friends are defending are not Labour-controlled; so this cuts across politics. They are Tory-controlled councils which have made these points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is a great believer in local democracy, as we all are in this Committee. If local democracy in this case is to have its say, I should point out that Cam-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0477">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>875</span>
bridge and Suffolk neither made a demand on the one hand nor a request on the other for Haverhill to be taken into the County of Cambridge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest to the Minister that he looks at it along the yardstick of local democracy, of flexibility within local government, and of the growth point 	<i>versus</i> the non-growth point. I hope that the Minister will respond to the appeal of my right hon. Friend and agree to have another look at it on Report. If he decides today to stick dogmatically to the line that was shown in his reply, this will be one decision in the whole Committee stage of the Bill that has been reached by dogma, and dogma by the Minister. Hon. Members. opposite may divide the Committee on party lines, but if any hon. Member is not impressed by the presentation of the case and disappointed in the defence as presented by the Minister, then he has not been listening carefully this morning to the two sides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will ask my hon. Friends to withdraw the Amendment and say that he is prepared to re-examine the case, looking at it in the light of the evidence presented this morning; and that he will come back on Report with a different set of plans so that everybody in this part of the country will be satisfied but, above all, that democracy will have had its say in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cocks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) has put into elegant and Parliamentary language the impression which I as a new Member of the House had gained from the Minister's performance. I have a great regard for the Minister whom I know to be a fair-minded man. In the course of Committee work I have seen something of him during the year and a half that I have been here. I have seen the various moods, ranging from the synthetic indignation of the Samlesbury Adjournment debate right through a wide range of colours and contexts. Before my right hon. Friend described it in more elegant language, I felt about the Minister's case that he was frankly scraping the barrel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Coming to prepare this brief, although I was convincing myself that there was a substantial case here against the proposals, I felt that when the Minister
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>876</span>
replied he would produce a number of telling reasons which pointed towards the correctness of the Government's decision. I am extremely disappointed with his answer because to raise the sort of point that he did regarding the bus services will, I am sure, be taken by people who live in this area, with specific local knowledge, as virtually irrelevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He mentioned the question of industry. I will be quite fair with the Committee. I heard mention of a possibility that the industries of Haverhill might benefit from the spin-off which resulted from the scientific work undertaken at the Cambridge University Physical Science laboratory. Whilst I felt at the time that this was rather thin, that benefiting from advance research work was not a question of distance, but rather that it was a question of dissemination of knowledge and its application, this was the only shred of evidence which was produced regarding industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree with me that the spin-off from scientific research of the sort that is mentioned at Cambridge University is liable to be felt all over the country, and possibly all over the world? But so far as I know, there is no intention of making the world part of Cambridgeshire yet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cocks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate my hon. Friend's point. Indeed, he has clarified the point I was trying to make. My hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove (Mr. Terry Davis) put to the Minister this figure of 1.16 per cent. employed in Cambridge on the latest 1966 figures. The Minister said that there was a trend in evidence and that it would grow. The Registrar-General's own figures show that in 1951 3.13 per cent. of the total population of Haverhill worked in Cambridgeshire. By 1961, this figure had reduced to 1.66 per cent. and by 1966 to a mere 1.16 per cent. With local industry expanding as it is with the growth of the town, the whole work load in Haverhill is very much more oriented toward the developing areas of the town than to any peripheral outlying area. This pattern is repeated in other developing areas of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With great respect, I do not feel that the Minister has really answered the point that I put to him about the question of development. I am quite sure that Cam-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0478">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>877</span>
bridgeshire and Ely County Council would not take it amiss if I describe them as being very much more a stable mechanistic sort of council, coping with an existing situation without any great radical changes in prospect, and tuned in to this. If one grafts on to the very periphery of an area like this a tremendously burgeoning and expanding area, one is setting up stresses and strains not only of an administrative nature, which may now act to the detriment of both areas but in particular to the thriving expanding area which is being added.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I submit that here there is an essentially organic situation. It is a situation of rapid growth, of changing patterns, where decisions are having to be made with far-reaching consequences. It is very much more suited to the style of local government already evolved in West Suffolk, and of such overriding importance that these fragments of reasons which the Minister has scraped up pale into insignificance beside it. This is an area which will grow to some 30,000 people within the very near future, and possibly even more after that. It is true it is in the take-off zone. As the Minister said, it is now generating its own growth, but this all has to be carefully integrated with the surrounding area, and, because the place is a success, there is no reason at all for saying that it is not in need of the help of the rest of their colleagues in West Suffolk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So we are left to ask—what is the motive? I am afraid that what the Minister has said simply boils down to "the Government know best". If there is any other reason, we have not been told it. I think many of my colleagues on this side of the Committee are very dissatisfied with the Minister's reply, and goodness alone knows what the local people will think of it. I think that over this series of Amendments we have, to some extent, in discussing Schedule 1, reached a watershed. We have put forward cases, and cases have been put forward from the other side, of varying merit, and the Minister has responded, very often predictably, giving way or standing firm. But, leaving aside my own advocacy of this case, I feel that here there is a case of sufficient strength, but we have not got from the Minister the sort of response which we have become entitled to expect from him during the course of this Com-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>878</span>
mittee stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reiterate what my right hon. Friend the Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) said. Will the Minister, at this late stage, at least say to the Committee that he is prepared to have another look at this, that he appreciates the concern expressed by Committee Members, that he appreciates the concern felt by the local authorities and the local people, that he will have another look at this and consider it again at a later stage of the Bill? I ask the Minister in all sincerity to make good his slight fall from grace in the very sketchy case which he presented to the Committee, and give us the concession that he will look at this again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support what my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South (Mr. Michael Cocks) has said and what my right hon. Friend the Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) said about thinking again on this Amendment. We have had many Amendments before this Committee; a sort of pattern has evolved, so far as the Government are concerned, and I think it is quite a fair pattern. Provided that the inhabitants of an area have an overwhelming wish in one direction, and provided that the fundamental Government concept of the structure of local government is not being impeded, the Minister has given way to hon. Gentlemen on the other side and on this side of the Committee in favour of the local wishes in the particular area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can understand that he does not want to have his basic structure damaged. This does not damage the basic concept and structure of local government as the Government envisage it. One can appreciate, too, that he wants an overwhelming case submitted to him that the people of the area want something, according to the White Paper. That, clearly, my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South and my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove (Mr. Terry Davis) gave to the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have all had a brief from Haverhill. It is very significant that Haverhill want this. Both East and West Suffolk want it, but, so far as I am aware, the voice of Cambridgeshire has never been heard in this Committee. Very often what one gets is a tug of war between two different authorities over a particular area. So far as Cambridgeshire is concerned, it does
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0479">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>879</span>
not seem to be playing. It does not want Haverhill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Swain) said he felt like a juryman. With respect to my two hon. Friends, the right hon. Gentleman and the Minister of State, both of whom are in the same profession as I am, I feel very akin to being in a matrimonial court. It is rather like a custody case, involving a child, with one of whose parents the child has always lived, and the court says that custody should not be given to that parent, that it should be given to a complete stranger who does not want the child. That is what the Government are saying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am most surprised that the Minister has taken a firm stand because I regarded this as a sort of bureaucratic oversight, that the other areas that had gone into Cambridgeshire had now been taken out, but that poor Haverhill was somehow going in. I honestly expected, in view of the give and take that has been displayed by the Government and by the Minister with regard to areas such as this, that he would accept my hon. Friend's Amendment, because the overwhelming wish of the people of the area was that they should remain in Suffolk, that Suffolk wants them, and that Cambridgeshire does not want them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from all the statistics about how many people go on the bus and how many buses run, the essential fact is that this Committee should be considering the wishes of the people of the area, of its council, of its county council, and the disregard of Cambridgeshire, which does not want Haverhill. I earnestly ask the Minister, in view of the way he has been very generous with this Committee, provided basic Government concepts were not infringed, merely to say that perhaps there is a case for Haverhill remaining in Suffolk. I ask him to say that a case has been made out, that he will think about it, and on Report that the Government will make their decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been told that I did not deal with the question of hospitals and education. I thought that I had touched on those in replying to the first speeches in this debate. There is no doubt that in the case of hospitals, Haverhill doctors send their patients to Adden-brookes in Cambridge or to Newmarket
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>880</span>
General Hospital. The Haverhill ambulances are tied to those hospitals and, I understand, do not go anywhere else. Not long ago the Haverhill council organised a hospital visiting service, financed partly from the rates, which serves Cambridge and Newmarket. That is the set-up at the moment with the hospital service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that this is more or less the pattern of hospitals and ambulance services throughout the country?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was asked to deal with the hospital situation. I have dealt with it factually, I hope.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister deal with the second point which was very strongly made by my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove (Mr. Terry Davis). If the Minister is saying, as far as the economic contacts are concerned, that they will be greater in the future, he must also look at the hospital context. My hon. Friend's point was that the link is with Adden-brookes and with Cambridge at the moment—we all know Addenbrookes; it is a very fine hospital—but it is likely to be with Bury St. Edmunds in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Bury St. Edmunds' new hospital will undoubtedly take a certain number of the patients from this area, but I do not think that sufficient beds will be provided by Bury St. Edmunds to alter the present trend of going to Cambridge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems to me that it destroys the argument of a hospital link between Cambridge and Haverhill if there is another hospital in Bury St. Edmunds which will draw people away from the other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may draw some but not sufficient to change the whole trend which has been building up over the years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of education, Haverhill's education is based on West Suffolk county at the moment but, where there is freedom to choose, as with day release students, more go to Cambridge than to Bury St. Edmunds. Again, where there is freedom to choose, those looking for advanced courses in arts and so on go to Cambridge where there is a wide range of opportunities which are not provided by Bury.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, in higher edu-

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>881</span>
cation more people will tend to go to Cambridge than to Bury St. Edmunds. That is inevitable because the facilities will be much greater there. One could apply this all round in the West Suffolk area but one does not put them into Cambridgeshire as a result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are occasions when planning and expansion arguments seem to one so convincing that one has to overrule in one's own mind the wishes of the local people. The Committee will know that on very many occasions I have finally decided a balanced argument on the wishes of the people, as disclosed either by their local councils or perhaps by reputable referenda taken within the area. Where, however, I am faced with quite obvious bases for the economic and planning future of an area which, to my mind, goes against the immediate wishes of the local people, then I have to put it to the Committee that the decision reached was based on that expansion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arguments which have been put forward in this debate are mainly that the links with Cambridge are weak, not that the strength lies in links with towns in Suffolk, Bury St. Edmunds or Ipswich, and I very much doubt whether, if Haverhill were now in Cambridgeshire, there would have been an Amendment on the Order Paper to move it to Suffolk. It arises, I agree, because there is the movement of the county boundary here and an apparent disturbance of tradition and people's emotions. There really is no real industrial or planning or local government link between Suffolk towns and Haverhill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must take up the Minister's point about education. I am sure that he would not wish to mislead the Committee but he suggested that there were stronger links in further education between Haverhill and Cambridge than between Haverhill and Suffolk. I feel I should draw his attention to the fact that in the county council's statement of the case they say,
	<br><q><p>"The fact that people from Haverhill attend a technical college in Cambridge has been used to suggest a degree of dependence of the one upon the other. There is, of course, a free trade between authorities so far as education is concerned, but the fact is that more people from Haverhill attend further education classes in Bury St. Edmunds than in Cambridge."</p></q>
I am informed that there are only six
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>882</span>
full-time students from the town of Haverhill attending further education establishments in Cambridgeshire, plus 50 part-time day students some of whom already work in Cambridge. Almost all the students from Haverhill are taking courses which are not offered at the West Suffolk College of Further Education. This co-operation between counties is quite usual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So there are six full-time and 50 part-time students. On the other hand—and this information comes from the county council to the Secretary of State—there are 12 full-time students and 75 part-time day students who undertake courses at the West Suffolk College of Further Education at Bury St. Edmunds. On further education the case is the other way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My advice does not accord with some of the statements set out in this brief given to hon. Members by the Haverhill Council</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And the Suffolk County Council. I am advised differently, for example, on education. May I say that I should be less than honest with the Committee if I said that I was convinced by the arguments which have been put forward in favour of the Amendments. I formed a firm view about this in visiting the area and studying the facts about Haverhill and the rural districts around it. As the Committee knows, I am not an obstinate man; I should not be frank if I said that I had been convinced that I am wrong today. I am still convinced that I am right. Having regard, however, to the weight of the argument against me, I shall look at this again before the Report stage. I am not giving an assurance that my mind will be changed. I have given the reasons for my decision which were on planning and economic grounds; but I am only human and the argument against me today makes me go back and look at it again. I hope that the Committee, by not coming to a final decision on this today, will allow me to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will appreciate that the real point of the Amendment lies in the consequential Amendment No. 375 which sets out a proposed new authority of Tamar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the best way of dealing with this series of Amendments is to go back to the debate in another place, in which the noble Lady, Baroness Sharp, gave a qualified but gracious welcome to the Government's proposals for the reorgani-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>884</span>
sation of local government. I hope that the Committee will bear with me if I quote at rather more length than I normally do. So much of this is on the point that we are now to consider, and the authority is such an important one that it is worth quoting it almost in full. Baroness Sharp said:
	<br><q><p>"There is no internal cohesion between the area centred on Plymouth and the whole of the county of Devon; and I am stressing this particularly because I think this is one of the very important areas of the country.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>"In all my long years in the Ministry I watched the Plymouth City Council pull itself up after the blitz and really do an enormous amount towards creating, in Plymouth, one of the strong growing points of the South-West. There really is an area that is based on Plymouth, that is related to Plymouth, and which makes a Plymouth County, which is not part and parcel of Devon; and if you throw Plymouth into Devon you arrest and cripple a great deal of the enormous efforts that have been made in that part of the country to pull up the City and to increase its strength and its economy."</p></q>
Later, she said:
	<br><q><p>"Incidentally, it is a piece of sentimental nonsense to say that the Tamar is still the western boundary of Plymouth, because it is not. Anybody who goes there knows perfectly well that Plymouth has spread across the Tamar; and in creating these new local government areas, however much one may want to stick to the historic county boundaries where one can, one really must not do that to the point of crippling a proper local government area, as the proposals in this particular area would do."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>House of Lords,</i> 29th March, 1971; Vol. 316, 	<i>cc.</i> 1122-3]</p></q>
That is a formidable case to answer. It is made by a devoted civil servant—the first woman Permanent Secretary in the history of our country—who served under successive Ministers of successive parties. When she says that, in a speech which broadly welcomes the Government's proposals—as I do not—a great deal more attention should be given to it than when others say it. So there we have the case in detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One has a great deal of sympathy with the Minister and with those who drew up the present proposals. I accept that it is difficult to know what to do about the area, and how best to plan it. We have the very large, growing city of Plymouth, with about 250,000 inhabitants, in an area which is less populous and where, under the present proposals, it would clearly be impossible to make Plymouth a local authority on its own. That situation does not occur to quite the same extent in any
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0482">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>885</span>
other part of the country. There are cases where this is partly true—as with Southampton and Portsmouth—but not so impressively true as in the case of Plymouth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the present proposals, what can the Minister do? He has to accept that if the proposals go through, Plymouth, with its 250,000 people, will be ruled by Exeter. Exeter is a very fine, historic county town. It is a very pleasant centre. But its population is under 100,000 and from all administrative points of view it remains 42 miles away from Plymouth—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denis Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Forty-six.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says that it is 46.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Forty-three.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that it is 43. Let us at least agree that however far away it is, it is beyond even the wit of the Minister to move it nearer. There it is. It remains in the forties, away from Plymouth. I may be wrong—I have not researched the point—but I do not suppose that there is any other example in the Bill of so large a city's suddenly becoming subservient to a comparatively small one so far away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second difficulty that the Minister has to face is the lack of the estuarial connection to which we have referred from time to time, and which in Humber-side at least we all agreed made for a solid county. If, as Baroness Sharp says, the Tamar is no longer the boundary, we come back to the old argument of rivers being unifying rather than divisive. Here the Minister is in a quandary, because he has to go against his own doctrine. Indeed, I believe that Baroness Sharp made that point earlier in her speech. Those are two of the difficulties which the Minister has to face.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's third difficulty is that the population of Plymouth is about 250,000 and the city of Plymouth definitely does not wish to become part of the County of Devon. The Minister has argued that the citizens of the areas added in the Amendment would not wish to be joined with Plymouth. That may be so, but the figure of 250,000 counts overwhelmingly in the mathematics of the argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also has to get over the history of the matter, which is that ever
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>886</span>
since the Redcliffe-Maud proposals there has been a common approach among the various political parties in Plymouth. They do not seem to have gone back on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the negative points. From the positive angle, if one takes the points of community of interest, population, and so on, there is no doubt that people from Saltash and Torpoint are citizens of Plymouth in all but the nominal way. They look to Plymouth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the arguments about connection, advanced, on the last Amendment—and many more—apply to the inhabitants of Saltash and their connection with Plymouth. In its own way the Saltash Bridge, like the Humber Bridge, has created a geographical situation which is different even from the past. So there we have it—an interest of population and a contiguity which was one of the factors that we looked for before. Transport and planning considerations lead inevitably in the same direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I want to be absolutely fair to the Minister. I do see his difficuties. There are difficulties about this concept. To make such a new authority is perhaps to do hurt or mischief to other areas that will be affected by such a change. I fully understand that. I should be less than human and less than kind—especially after the gracious way in which the Minister behaved on the last Amendment—if I did not point out that the problem facing him is an appalling one. He has to make a decision one way or the other, and neither decision is perfect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why, having made these points, I do not want to overstress them. I should genuinely welcome the Minister's thoughts—perhaps his philosophical thoughts—before he tells us what he has in mind. I suspect that I know what that is, but I should like to hear his reasoning. I should like him to state, absolutely openly, what problems face him. They are very large problems. If, from time to time, I have been a bit sharp in the Committee, I certainly shall not be over this point, except in the use of the name of the noble Lady who first suggested that these proposals might be wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Hannam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make a brief contribution to the debate on a part of the country which plays a vital role in the economy of the South-West region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My constituency of Exeter is recognised as a natural communication centre
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0483">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>887</span>
of Devon and the region, but Plymouth is our major regional industrial port and conurbation. I have a great deal of sympathy for Plymouth, and the problems that it has faced in the past. Its distance from London and other industrial areas of Britain, magnified by appalling road, rail and air communications, has resulted in strong feelings of isolation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the opening up of the new industrial estates and the attraction of many new factories and firms, drawn to the area by the vigorous promotional activities of the Plymouth City Council—combined with the A38 from Exeter to Plymouth being made a dual-carriageway and the arrival in the near future of the M5 motorway to that part of the world—I do see the ending of that period of isolation. I therefore oppose the Tamarside proposal. It would destroy the hopes of Devon and Cornwall that a sensible and satisfactory two-tier marriage of town and country would be created by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Exeter, which is an ancient county borough with a great history, is also losing many of its traditional powers. Like other county boroughs, it would have preferred a unitary authority for itself. Having taken part in the discussions concerning the whole case for this two-tier system, and the discussions concerning the whole of Devon, however, Exeter now firmly supports the proposed new county authority, provided Plymouth remains part of that county and that authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Plymouth argument is that the city would be dominated by rural populations, but the combined population of Plymouth, Exeter and Torbay, to be included in the new county, would be 450,000 out of a total county population of about 896,000, which is a nice balance between town and country. If we take away the Plymouth population of about 256,000, we see that a frightful imbalance in the County of Devon will be created.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that in the proposed County of Devon there will be ample opportunity and scope for Plymouth to play a major role, not only in the government of the city but of the county as a whole. I am sure from my discussions with the councillors in Exeter and other areas of Devon that they would support the establishment in Plymouth of major sections of the county administration. One thinks of education, for example. If Devon is to be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>888</span>
an effective, worthwhile authority, Plymouth must be part of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want also to speak on behalf of Cornwall, and Members representing constituencies there which are affected by the proposals for a Tamarside County. They are totally opposed to the loss of parts of South East Cornwall to this proposed authority. The strongest representations have been made to the Minister by Cornwall, and I am sure that he is taking them into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have dared to venture across the Tamar and into Cornwall on many occasions each year, and I can confirm that the problems of U.D.I., which we face in other parts of the world, are as nothing compared with the reactions of the Cornish if we foreigners here in Westminster were to dare to 'annex land from over that traditional river frontier to include in a Plymouth authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rural areas around Plymouth are also totally opposed to being integrated into a city-dominated county. In Clifton St. Mary, for example—the large R.D.C. area surrounding Plymouth to the East—over 71 per cent. voted against being included in a Plymouth authority when the Redcliffe-Maud Report was first published. If that same democratic referendum were taken now the percentage would be far greater.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the interests of the whole of Cornwall and of Devon—believing as I do in a two-tier structure of local Government which the Bill proposes—I urge the Committee to reject these Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Roper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Exeter (Mr. John Hannam) has argued some of the reasons why Plymouth would fit well into the new county of Devon. It is important to realise that Devon, even as it is at the moment—excluding the county borough of Plymouth—is a difficult county to administer. When the Devon County Council made its submissions to the Redcliffe-Maud Commission on Local Government, it made it clear that the principal difficulties which affect the administration of the area of the county council concerned distance and communications, the lack of community of interest between the seaside resorts and the agricultural hinterland, and the lack of adequate financial resources. It said that because of its size—
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0484">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>889</span>
	<br><q><p>"Devon is more than ordinarily expensive to administer,"</p></q>
and
	<br><q><p>"Considerable areas of the county are more than one hour's travelling distance from Exeter."</p></q>
It also said that in the holiday season the road congestion made it even more difficult for people to get to meetings at the county hall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even before it was pro'posed to add Plymouth, the Devon County Council considered that it was a particularly difficult county to administer. To add to a county which was already difficult to administer, the extra 256,000 people of the county borough of Plymouth seems to me to compond the difficulties, and therefore to add substance to the Amendments moved by my right hon. Friend the hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) Plymouth will be 43 miles from Exeter and 70 miles from the east and north-east boundaries of the county.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill proposes that in the new county, 29 per cent. of the population—meaning the people of Plymouth—will be squeezed right down to the south-western corner. This imbalance will add to the cost of administering the county, and will reduce efficiency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to note that when the proposals were first issued, in the circular of February last year, the Chairman of the Devon County Council said,
	<br><q><p>"This is surprising news indeed. We had hoped that Plymouth would be retained as a free-standing city—as the county council had suggested.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>We do not welcome the suggestion that it should be included in a Devon first-tier authority for a number of reasons, among them the fact that it will create an imbalance between town and country in the administration of the geographical county …"</p></q>
Travelling has been referred to already. The fact that it takes about two-and-a-half hours to get from Plymouth to Exeter will make it increasingly difficult to persuade the best people to serve on the new local authority based at Exeter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not take two-and-a-half hours to get from Plymouth to Exeter, which would probably be the headquarters of county hall. The time taken is nearer 55 to 60 minutes along the dual-carriageway, and certainly less by train.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if I misled the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>890</span>
Committee. What I meant was that two-and-a-half hours would be the total travelling time, both there and back, which is not too different from the two hours estimated by the hon. Member for Exeter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other problem is that the great and important decisions at county level in a non-metropolitan county will be taken at Exeter rather than at Plymouth on matters such as road schemes, traffic regulations and planning in so far as it affects jobs. As my right hon. Friend said, Plymouth has had an outstanding record in trying to build up its industry in the post-war period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that one can establish a community of interest for the proposed new Tamar County Council, which is a much more genuine one, rather than have the imbalance which would exist in the Devon County Council as proposed in this Schedule. The area around Plymouth provides a large number of people who come into and work in the city itself. Many work in the defence industries, which make up about 20 per cent. of the total employment in the Plymouth county borough. It seems to me that the future for Plymouth lies in building up a nucleus of industry, and it will be more likely to be able to do that if there is a separate Tamar County Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could point to a number of directions in which the Plymouth County Council has taken a lead in the post-war period in education, child care, and welfare work. This authority has shown considerable initiative in the post-war period, and I believe that it would provide the basis for a viable and effective county, as proposed in the Amendments. I hope that, as he did on the last Amendment, the Minister will look at this again, in order to make a satisfactory arrangement for this part of our country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In reply to the hon. Member for Exeter (Mr. Hannam) perhaps I might refer again to my football experiences which always seem to interest the Committee or they interest me, anyway. When one has referred at Torquay United, Exeter City or Plymouth Argyle, one is in a better position perhaps than most Members of this Committee to understand a degree of unity—or lack of it—between those authorities. When I have refereed matches between those
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0485">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>891</span>
teams I have never been struck by a degree of unity between Exeter or Plymouth, or between Torquay and Plymouth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannam</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not the hon. Gentleman agree that a lack of unity might also exist between the authorities of other large cities in the country, such as Manchester?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Local patriotism is stronger in Liverpool, Manchester or Birmingham. If one goes to those grounds, one gets the impression, not merely that the city is divided, but that everything else is a world away. In terms of geographical distance, it is another world away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I spend all my holidays in Devon, particularly in the Torbay area, so I can claim to be familiar with the neighbourhood. One of the first questions that I wish to raise, and one of great importance, is about the availability of people to serve on this local authority. This is of great importance, because what we are asking is that people from Plymouth should come on to a local authority and be prepared, week after week, to travel 43 miles in order to attend committee meetings of the local authority. If the problem is put in those terms, one realises that this proposal is a nonsense. Where on earth will we get people, even in our industrial towns, who will be able to give that much time to local government with all its complexities?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the rural areas, and particularly in the South-West, the problem is magnified. It is well known—I do not know whether hon. Gentlemen opposite who represent the South-West find the situation very different—that there is a growing difficulty in obtaining people of the right calibre, with a great and passionate interest in local government, who can get the time off and have the resources to attend committee meetings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If someone serves on the education committee of this new authority and lives in Plymouth, attendance at meetings of all sorts of institutes all over Plymouth will make it almost a full-time job. That is one aspect which the Committee ought not to lose sight of in trying to determine the future of local government It is an aspect on which we have not spent much time yet We shall come to it later when
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>892</span>
we discuss payments, and so on. But even generous payments—which I am sure the Government have in mind, or we hope they have in mind—will not solve the problem. Where, in the West Country, can we find people whose employers will let them have the time, not just to attend meetings, but to give up a complete day's work in order to attend a meeting of the local authority? This is a tremendous difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Morrison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is to be consistent and logical in what he said about the distance to be travelled to work, he should argue, with regard to the county of Devon, that in future all county councillors from Bideford rural district, Barnstaple rural district, Torrington, and probably South Molton, will have too far to go. They will have just as far to go as councillors from Plymouth. If the hon. Gentleman is arguing that way in relation to Devon, why should he not argue that way in relation to a large number of other counties in England and Wales, where already—and where in future—councillors have to go as far as councillors from Plymouth will have to go in future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be out of order if I were to return to the concept of the unitary authority, but that is the answer to the hon. Gentleman. In our proposals for unitary authorities we said that the services should be based on a centre, and should be total, and therefore there would be reasonable accessibility for members of the authority and for the public as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole of the discussion in this Committee so far has been based on the assumption that the centre of this new authority will be Exeter. Plymouth has a population of 250,000. If the membership of this new authority is to be based on population, the city of Plymouth and its environs will have rather more members of the new authority than will any other part of the county, possibly more than the rest of the county put together. If that happens, what will be the situation if those representatives in their wisdom, decide that Plymouth should be the centre and the local government headquarters of the new county?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Should that happen, I have no doubt that the hon. Member for Exeter (Mr. Hannam), who has accepted these pro-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0486">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>893</span>
posals with some degree of complacency, will argue that it is monstrous that the headquarters of county should be placed in the corner of this area. All that illustrates the difficulties to which my right hon. Friend referred. We know that it is not easy to form a judgment on these matters, but those are the problems that one has to face.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the hon. Gentleman did justice to the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Devises (Mr. Charles Morrison) by saying that the previous Administration's solution to the problem of distance lay in the unitary concept. Under the previous administration's White Paper, in Devonshire Area 35 was to be a unitary authority and included the whole of the northern coastline. I cannot think that the unitary concept met the particular point raised by my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With great respect to the hon. Gentleman, as we have said many times already, it is impossible to determine everything in the future of local government on the basis of mathematical formulae. That is why these difficulties arise. We had said in respect of Lancaster and the Isle of Wight, to mention two examples, that we agree that there have to be some anomalies. All that one can hope to do on either side of the Committee when trying to determine the future of local government is to keep the anomalies to a minimum and make sensible and intelligent exceptions where possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be out of order if I were to go too far in the direction of the previous Government's White Paper, so I will return to the Tamar. As my right hon. Friend said, the building of the Tamar Bridge has made a tremendous difference geographically and industrially to the whole area. From reading these proposals one has the feeling that the Government have not taken that sufficiently into account. The Committee will recall that the last Labour Government made this an intermediate area in terms of industrial expansion, and both sides of the Committee would agree, I think, that Plymouth has done a good job in trying to get industry developed in the Southwest. Those who live there or who spend their holidays there will know that if there is one thing that this area needs, it is the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>894</span>
development of a degree of industry. There is an over-use of the holiday and resort industry in this neighbourhood, which acts to the detriment of the majority of the people there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the South-West is the playground of the country, and we like to go there, it is inescapable that the largest industry should be the leisure industry. However, it has a profound effect upon the lives of ordinary people who, in thousands of cases, are restricted in their livelihoods to the period from April/May until about September. It completely distorts the living pattern of people in this area. Anybody with even a passing acquaintanceship with it knows, therefore, that a growth of industry is needed down here and that growth has objectively to be centred and based upon Plymouth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Plymouth councils have not usually been under Labour control, I am sorry to say, but, as far as I know, there is no difference between the parties on this. On an all-party basis, Plymouth Council tried to establish Plymouth as a natural industrial development centre for the South-West and, therefore, we should pay great heed to what that council tells us about difficulties in industrial location and development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, if one looks at the travel pattern in the area, one sees that the Tamar Bridge has transformed the situation. Plymouth is the natural point of gravitation, not only for people living outside it within the county of Devon, but also from across the Tamar in the County of Cornwall. The old situation when everything depended on the old Torpoint Ferry has been gone for some years and we must deal with the new situation as we see it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to make one last point, and I hope that the Minister will be able to give us some indication of the Government's thinking. When we look at the water resources proposals, it is interesting to note that the Government have decided that waterways and water resources should be based on the geographical facts. That being the case, one would have thought that the proposals here for the Tamar would run contrary to their thinking on water resources proposals. One would have thought that the Tamar was the natural heart of the whole neighbourhood, that both sides of it came together, and that the Tamar bridge cemented the relationship between the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0487">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>895</span>
north of Cornwall and the south of Devon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from the arguments of industry and the convenience of the public, if this point is to be stressed anywhere in our debates it ought to be stressed in respect of these proposals: that it is not just the difficulty of finding councillors who will travel 43 miles to serve on committees, but that there is the important relationship between the public and the local government servant. People want to meet the man who is making the decision about their children's future; they want to talk to the education officer or the chief administrative education officer or the medical officer of health, or whoever are the appropriate people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wherever this new county decides to have its centre and its headquarters, we are imposing a tremendous burden upon the public, because they have to travel long distances in order to consult about their problems. For the 250,000 people in Plymouth, if the headquarters are in Exeter, it will mean a journey of 43 miles in order to have a personal interview. I think all of us are committed to the proposition that there should be a much closer involvement between the ordinary people at grass roots level in our society and the administrators at all levels. It is not just the difficulty of finding people to serve on local authorities 43 miles away and to travel there, but there is also the convenience and inconvenience of the public doing the same thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are the great difficulties in the Government proposals, but I agree with my right hon. Friend that there are difficulties the other way, so the Minister has to exercise the judgment of Solomon to hold the right balance between the people in Plymouth, in Exeter and other parts of the country. So I hope that the Minister will make an early intervention and indicate the Government's thinking here and the philosophy and principles upon which the Government have based their decisions upon the Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Gentleman has said about them, but I am sure they would be even more appreciative if he had the courtesy to refer to Plymouth as a city, and not a town.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hoped that nothing I said would be taken as derogatory of them. If I called Plymouth a town, thinking more of the expansion and development of the area, rather than calling it a city, which is the historical name, I did not mean any insult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should now like to deal with the figures. The Amendment would seek to create a county with a population of 329,000. We must look at the division of the population amongst the areas in that new proposed county. The county borough of Plymouth has a population of 239,000. The areas of Devon which the Amendment seeks to bring into this new county of Plymouth would have a population of 60,000. The areas of Cornwall to be brought into the county would have a population of 30,000, making a total of 329,000 which, on the figures of counties as defined in the Bill, is small. It would undoubtedly make a small county.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, a greater objection is the difficulty of dividing it into balanced districts. If the county borough of Plymouth is to remain as one district—and I cannot imagine that it would wish to be divided—it will hold sway over 73 per cent. of the new county.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We argued this point in the case of the proposed county around Luton. I told the Committee on that occasion that we had no less than 24 proposals of this sort, where large towns sought to have a county around them and to be in a controlling position in that county.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some cases we have created that county—as in Avon. The preponderance there of one city is nowhere near so great

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>897</span>
as 73 per cent. When it comes to that stage it makes something of a stupidity of the two-tier system. It reduces it almost to a unitary system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Member aware that in the case of Cardiff the Government propose to give a preponderance of 80 per cent. over the other little areas linked around the city?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I expected the right hon. Gentleman to come back on that. He may have noticed that I went on talking to prevent his interruption. Of course, he is right. Wales is an exception to everything. I am not going to argue the local government of England from the point of view of Wales. I leave my right hon. Friend to do that when we reach the part of the Bill dealing with Wales. I want to indicate to the Committee the way the Government's mind was working on the proposal for a new county.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having given the figures for the proposed new county, let me explain what that would leave in the existing counties of Devon and Cornwall on either side. It would reduce Devon to 836,000 from a present figure of 896,000. It would reduce Cornwall to 368,000 from a present figure of 377,000. Neither of these reductions would be serious. I do not seek to make any argument about that. We would still be left with viable counties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return again to this difficulty of making a reasonable county of the area proposed by the Amendment, the difficulty of dividing it into balanced divisions. Incidentally, looking at its boundaries, it makes some rather strange boundaries in Devon, where it divides the Dartmoor National Park, and cuts in half what I have always understood and felt to be an area very much related, the area from Newton Abbot down to the south. Those are the figures which would result from the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the figures as they stand in the Bill. Let us see what part Plymouth will play in the Devon county as proposed by the Government's Plymouth county borough. With its population of 239,000, it will hold 27 per cent. of the population in the new Devon county. I think it is rather absurd to talk about Exeter ruling Plymouth, or Plymouth being ruled by Exeter. In fact, Exeter county borough will have only 11 per cent. in the new county, and Torbay 12 per cent. Those
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>898</span>
three ex-county boroughs of Plymouth, Exter and Torbay will account for 50 per cent. of the Devon county, and the rural areas of Devon will account for the other 50 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here is a very attractive balance of districts, a balance of population, in the Devon county as proposed by the Bill—50 per cent. the ex-county boroughs and 50 per cent. the rural areas. Various reasons have been put forward for the new Plymouth county stretching over both sides of the Tamar and taking in a portion of its hinterland. No other local authority in the area supports this proposal other than Plymouth. No other local authority concerned in the county proposed by the Amendment and outside it, either in Cornwall or Devon or in the area proposed to be taken into the new Plymouth county, supports these proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that the boundary was drawn in order to take in with Plymouth its hinterland, which is reasonably dependent upon Plymouth. But if Plymouth is in the Devon county the hinterland need not necessarily be divided from it. It depends upon how the districts are arranged and how the boundaries placed, but there is no reason for separating Plymouth from its hinterland when they both become part of the same county. Plymouth will participate in the government of the county, a function which it has not enjoyed before. It will participate to the extent of having a 27 per cent. vote in the county council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Small Heath called attention to the antagonism between the local football teams. As was pointed out in an interjection, if we were to decide matters on that basis we should be dividing Merseyside between Everton and Liverpool and, if we were dealing with Edinburgh, I hate to think what we should be doing between Celtic and Rangers. We cannot base our local government reorganisation on the healthy rivalry of local football teams.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I went round the north of England trying to decide the right boundaries, I thought at one time that the right thing to do was to make counties based on those which played union, and those which played league, rugby. Good boundaries could be made out of that. We have considered the social connections and let those weigh in our arguments, but not

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>899</span>
to the extent of deciding county boundaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no doubt that others may wish to join in the debate. In case the Committee has made up its mind, I propose to sit down, saying that at the moment we cannot accept the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
