	<div class='page-header'><h1>LOCAL GOVERNMENT BILL</h1></div>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 80</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>QUALIFICATIONS FOR ELECTION AND HOLDING OFFICE AS MEMBER OF LOCAL AUTHORITY</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>4.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Morrison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 637, in page 50, line 27, leave out "of the authority".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this Amendment we can take the following: Amendment No. 517, in page 50, line 28, leave out paragraphs (	<i>b</i>), (	<i>c</i>) and (	<i>d</i>).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment No. 783, in page 50, line 28, leave out paragraphs (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>).</p>
	<p>Amendment No. 518, in page 50, line 37, leave out "or within three miles of it".</p>
	<p>and Amendment No. 638, in page 50, line 45, at end insert:
	<br><q><p>"and 'area' means in the case of a county council election the relevant electoral division and in the case of a district council election the relevant ward returning a number of councillors divisible by three, or (as the case may be) the relevant ward returning a single councillor together with any two other wards contiguous thereto".</p></q></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morrison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Amendment attempts to deal with the territorial qualification of councillors with which this Clause is concerned. The form of the Amendment is related to an earlier Amendment, proposed by the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) in Clause 8(	<i>b</i>), which was concerned with wards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before going further, I should like to say that there is a difference, in respect of my Amendment No. 638, between the situation which exists in the urban areas and in the rural areas. Amendment 638 aligns the provisions with regard to territorial qualifications all across the board, both n town and in country areas, I accept that this may be too far-reaching.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle which is involved in Amendment 638 is that the great en-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1448</span>
largement of districts, which arises out of amalgamation of urban and rural areas, justifies a reappraisal of the qualification of candidates. The present principle of qualification is that a candidate may come from the whole of the local authority area in which an election is taking place. A new situation will arise in which the wards, or areas within a local authority total area, will be much greater than was previously the case. In consequence, there is an argument, in any case in the rural areas, for changing the principle of territorial qualification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, as the Bill is drawn at present, there is a danger of unbalanced representation if it continues on that basis. On the old basis, it would be possible for all, or a high proportion of, candidates for a district, to come from perhaps one substantial town, or even from one village, somewhere in the district, which happened to be the communications centre for that district. Clearly, if this happened—it may not be likely, but it could occur—this could mean that there would not be as good a representation of the areas and people involved as there should be. If representation was to become almost solely from an urban area within a district, the rural areas, and the arguments in respect of rural interests, would tend to be neglected, however hard the electorate's representatives tried to make a case for the rural areas. This would be due to the fact that those people living in rural areas, in certain instances, might be able to bring a rather different viewpoint to bear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend will be able to give sympathetic consideration to the Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to comment briefly on the Amendment of the hon. Member for Devizes (Mr. Charles Morrison). It is a somewhat dark day, for various reasons. Therefore, it may be that my mind has caught some of the darkness surrounding us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My reading of the removal of the words of the authority, which is the basis of the hon. Gentleman's Amendment, is that it must make nonsense of the later subsections. I should like the Minister of State for the Home Office, to consider this point before we look at its principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In later Clauses, references made to "in that area" obviously mean in the area of the authority. I think I am right
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0788">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1449</span>
in saying that to achieve what the hon. Gentleman wants to achieve, the drafting would need tightening up. But, as I have often said, that is a matter not for him or me but for those who draft the Bills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This group of Amendments, Sir Stephen, you will rightly put together, because they concern the whole question of qualifications for election and holding office as a member of a local authority. It cannot be assumed that they are all exactly on the same point, and, of course, they are not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want first to deal with the later Amendment, No. 518, standing in my name and that of my hon. and right hon. Friends which seeks to delete the words
	<br><q><p>"or within three miles of it".</p></q>
It seems to us that whatever may be the precedents set in days gone by, this is a totally unrealistic qualification today. One can quite understand that in ancient times, and before a more mobile system of transport, with farms stretching from the farmhouse down into the parish—a distance of four miles or so—there might have been some point in it. But I do not really think that there is very much point in it today. It seems to me that the qualification ought to be that one resides within an area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Government take a rather wider view of the connection between an individual and his qualification but, whether one says "residence" or "work" it seems to me that it ought to be within the area, and that is the purpose of my Amendment. I would be interested to know the philosophical basis of continuing this three-mile limit, particularly in an age of 12-mile limits and sometimes even 50-mile limits. I do not think that there is a philosophical basis behind it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the main Amendment No. 783, this is very much a point of principle. I do not propose to address the Committee at great length on this because I hope that, among others, my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Mr. John)—who I believe has personal knowledge of this problem from long Committee stages—	<b>and</b> my hon. Friend the Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) who has great experience of the iniquities of these subsections, will speak at a later stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has always been a fundamental principle of the Labour Party that only
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1450</span>
residents of an area should qualify. They have an obvious and direct connection and link. The Government will agree that they have an obvious and direct link with the area of the authority and we are not questioning that. We are adding to that the right of people in two categories—in paragraph (	<i>b</i>) that
	<br><q><p>"during the whole of the twelve months preceding that day occupied as owner or tenant any land or other premises in that area;"</p></q>
—which has been the Conservative doctrine for some time—and paragraph (	<i>c</i>) that the
	<br><q><p>"principal or only place of work during that twelve months has been in that area;"</p></q>
The Government will say that that implies a direct connection with the area and the work of the authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is always very difficult when one comes upon a philosophical basis of this sort, and tries to translate it into terms of fundamental principles, to decide what that philosophy is. We on this side of the Committee, and the Labour Party in general, have always taken the view that only residents should be entitled to be qualified. I have never fully understood the connection between those who work and those who have land in an area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that in the distant past, this was the basis of much of our law. It was the basis of much of our electoral law. There were property qualifications for Parliament just as there were for local authorities. But that time has passed. Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee—in some cases willingly, sometimes reluctantly, and sometimes historically—have all come to believe in the democratic principle of "one man one vote". Yet when we find an anachronism it is curious how the party opposite likes it to be perpetuated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The City of London is a very good case in point. I do not want to dig the knife in too deeply, because I am hoping to convert. I have failed to convert the Minister of State. This is where we ought to look again at our philosophy and see what it involves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be electoral advantages in having councillors in an area where one might not otherwise have had them, but I would not have thought that there was a lack of good material for councillors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the philosophy behind it? The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0789">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1451</span>
connection is a very tenuous one. I suppose that it is connected with the rates, because obviously people who own land are ratepayers. Even so, they do not have as much of a link with the area as the people who reside there and who require the many amenities of civilised life which are provided by the local authorities Those are the people with the real connection. The people who do not have that link are interested only in a very small part of the general work being done by the local authority. They are concerned only with the level of the rates, and with paying the bill at the end of the day. That seems so tenuous a link that it is worthwhile stating and restating where the difference in our philosophy lies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been two debates within the past two years on this subject. Nevertheless, I hope to have it restated today and I hope that, in that splendid, pragmatic approach—which is part of this very pragmatic Bill—that the Minister for Local Government and Development has shown during our many deliberations in the Committee, the Minister of State, Home Department will suddenly show himself liberated from this doctrinaire and anachronistic approach. I hope that he will see the light of reason, and will accept our Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully support what my right hon. Friend has said, particularly in regard to Clause 80(1)(	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>). Early in this session a most reactionary Bill was introduced by hon. Members opposite which restored property qualification to councillors and introduced the new provision allowing persons with their principal place of work in a particular area to sit on the local council. That is the kind of thing which has led to all the difficulties in Northern Ireland. This is the way that hon. Members on the Government benches regard local government, divorcing it from the principle held dear by any democrat, namely, "one man one vote". Only persons living in that area can sit on the authority of that area. It is the area where they belong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not a Londoner. My principal place of work is in the House of Commons. It is manifestly absurd that on the provision of a go-to-work area I could sit on the Westminster City Council. In effect, that is what this provision means. People with the most tenuous links with an area could, because of those links, sit
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1452</span>
on the local council. Let us consider the position of a person who is not in gainful, insurable employment—say, a housewife, whose only duties are the great service she renders to the community by being a councillor. That is her work. One therefore gets into a vicious circle, because, since her principal place of work is in the council, where she is a councillor, 	<i>ipso facto,</i> because she is a councillor, she can seek re-election to that council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the Government did in the previous Act is a manifest absurdity. They now seek to perpetuate it in this Bill, which is supposed to be a Bill for the reform of local government. This is a very bad provision, because it departs from the principle not only of "one man, one vote" but truly local government, whereby people living in a given area sit on the council of that area. The employment provision is bad enough, but what is far worse is the hangover from feudal times, in that the tenant or owner of any land—no rateable value is specified—for a period of twelve months prior to the election can be elected to the council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A trustee of land could presumably qualify under this provision, though he has no link with the area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, a trustee in land would be the owner in law. His name would be on the deeds, and he would be the freehold owner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation could be even more absurd. One can apply the 	<i>de minimis</i> principle to the words "any land in an area". Many people own a grave, which is a small piece of land. They own that grave into perpetuity. They own the freehold of that small piece of land where their relatives are buried. That will give them the right to sit upon the local council. How absurd!
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Principality of Wales there is a very enterprising man who sells small pieces of land—a square foot—on the sands of Cardigan Bay to expatriate Welshmen who want to own a little part of their homeland. He sells these waste sand dunes for a small fee and gives the buyers a deed. It is an absolutely harmless pursuit. The deed is something that they can put on their mantelpieces, so that they can say to their friends, "I own a little bit of Wales. I am a Welshman. I have my roots in Wales." There is no harm in that. I do not know what will be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0790">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1453</span>
the reaction of the local authority concerned, however, because the number of people who will have the right to sit on that authority will be astronomical. Half the expatriate Welsh population of Britain could go back to that area and serve upon that council. That is the sort of absurdity which will arise by allowing a property qualification of this nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I object not just to the absurdity of it but to the principle behind it. I am trying to ridicule the proposition by applying it to the ridiculous extents to which it could apply by using the words "any land". As a believer in democracy, I object to the fact that in 1972, in a Bill to reform local government, we should apply provisions which are nothing more than the hangover of feudal times.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fergus Montgomery</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has just said that he a great believer in democracy. Surely the whole thing boils down to the fact that anybody, in order to be elected to sit on a local council, has to submit himself to the electorate, and it is the electorate which decides who will serve on the council. Therefore, if someone has a property qualification but does not live in the area, the electorate will show its disapproval at the ballot box.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate what the hon. Gentleman has said, and in an ideal world, of course, that would be true. The hon. Gentleman's experience is very great, as his contributions to the Bill show. The Committee knows that in the practical realities of the local government world a pseudo-qualification can be obtained by someone who is the nominee of a political party in a safe ward. I will admit that it could be either political party. Someone who does not live in the area could acquire a tiny piece of land, not even as an owner but as a tenant, for 12 months prior to the election, hold on to the tenancy and, because he hold that tenancy of a piece of land purely for the sake of remaining on that council, he must be elected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are safe wards, marginal wards and hopeless wards. This provision is used where a political party wants on the council a man who may have left the area but who hangs on to a property qualification in order to stay on the council to render service to his party, although he
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1454</span>
no longer lives, or possibly has never lived, in the area concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David James</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman is trying to run this argument to the ground through ridicule. However he has not persuaded me why anyone should seek to do this kind of thing, merely by owning a burial plot. Surely a person would stand only if he were genuinely interested and committed to the problems of the area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a difficulty. The situation has not arisen in my constituency of Widnes, but it has done so nearby. The hon. Member for Bolton, East (Mr. Laurance Reed) knows that the situation has arisen where a Conservative councillor, who for many years has not lived within the authority concerned, remains on the council because he owns land in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This provision is medieval. The Government know that there has been much trouble in Northern Ireland over this undemocratic principle. In 1972, in a Bill intended to reform local government for the next half century, I ask the Government to get rid of this medieval absurdity, that if one owns a stick of land in the area it gives one the right to sit on the council and represent the people of that authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brynmor John</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my right hon. Friend the Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) has said, I had the dubious pleasure of probing exactly what the words in the Clause mean. As my hon. Friend the Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) has said, it is not easy to understand the meaning of the words "land and premises".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will say that the Government are not introducing a novel principle, but merely restoring the pre-1969 position, the idea being that some wicked Government had taken away a vital franchise. The provisions of the 1969 Act gave everyone in this country an equal chance of standing for membership of the council in the area in which he was registered as a local elector or where he resided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning the hon. Member for Brierley Hill (Mr. Montgomery) rightly said that if a man was qualified on the day of nomination and then moved 200 miles away, that would be absurd because he then could not serve the community pro-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0791">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1455</span>
perly. But the point about this qualification is that if a man owns a holiday cottage 200, 300 or 400 miles away from his principal place of abode he is able to stand as a member of that council. That is no less an absurdity than the temporal limitation we sought to have more closely defined this morning and upon which the Minister supported us. If the Minister believes that it is only those people who live in the area and have a thorough knowledge of it who can serve the people of that area, in justice he ought to eliminate any possibility of error or sharp practice by ensuring that people do not qualify to stand for the council merely because they have property in an area, but that they should live in the area and be registered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.0 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Montgomery</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the hon. Gentleman's point. I am opposed to people who live a long distance away serving on a local council. I think that it would be difficult for them to seek reelection. But the people with whom we are dealing are those who may live just outside a city boundary but have had all their connections in the city during their lifetime. They could be nearer the people they represent than someone who lives inside the city boundary but at the other end of the city, and who would be eligible to serve. These people could make a useful contribution to local government in the area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman, in putting that proposition, highlights the absurdity, because in order to cater for those people he must also bring in the examples that we have given of the holiday cottage owner, the grave owner, people who own property in an area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right that a man should be ablé to serve his community. I suggest that the community which he ought to serve is the place in which he resides and in which his family is reared and educated, not necessarily where he owns property. As an owner of premises, he may have no connection with that area. It is all very well to say "Trust the electorate", but we all know that we are elected because we are members of a political party, not because of our shining virtues as individuals. Therefore, if we are elected Members of Parliament on that party ticket, so are local government candidates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1456</span>
I am making a plea for equality of treatment for persons who are able to stand as candidates in a local government area; and that equality should be based on living in the area, being on the electoral roll in that area, where they have their closest roots and connections. The hon. Gentleman may say that business people living outside the area may have an interest in the city. I put to him that the interest they have in the city as owners of premises would be different from and inimical to the wishes of residents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main problem in local government today is the dichotomy between the desire for adequate services and the desire for lower rates. Everyone wants cheaper rates; everyone wants better services. But the people who live outside the area and merely own premises there are entirely obsessed with the idea of having as low a rateable value as possible on the premises. They do not live there; their children are not educated there; they are not interested in the services provided in that area. Therefore, if we enshrine this proposal in what is supposed to be a map of local government in this country for many years, we are enshrining a hidden source of tension which will cause considerable problems. It will lead to just the problems of urban decay in the centres of cities which we have seen, where there is this problem of the vast shift in population which comes in to work, but has no interest in what services are available in the city centres after that work is done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal briefly with the question of premises and place of work. I repeat the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Widnes. The Bill has been produced with no more careful a definition of "premises" than that given in the Local Authorities Qualification of Members Act 1970. In interpreting "land" and "premises", we must look at their definitions in other Acts. Premises can mean a ship; a person owning a houseboat or a yacht moored in a harbour could be the owner of premises for the purposes of this Act.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That goes without saying. Nevertheless he could stand. I suggest that in view of his oft-proclaimed connection with Broadstairs, it would be insulting to local government and destructive of the good name of local government if, by reason of his ownership of a yacht, he were able to stand for the Isle of Wight.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Richard Sharples)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman saying that the owner of a houseboat at Chelsea should not be allowed to stand?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am saying that if he lives there he is on the register, and under the provisions of Clause 80(1)(	<i>a</i>) he would be eligible. The hon. Gentleman is, as usual, completely wide of the mark. I am talking about the ownership of premises other than those whereby one is qualified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our problem is that the definition of "premises" is too wide. The hon. and learned Member for Runcorn (Mr. Carlisle), who led for the Government on that Bill, promised to look at the matter again, but nothing ever came of it. We are treated to the same vague definitions to which we were treated then, and the same assurance that it would be looked at and that it would not be abused, but we cannot be sure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The place of work has caused trouble, as the hon. and learned Member for Runcorn admitted, because it does not refer to insurable employment; it says "principal place of work". As my hon. Friend has said, that could refer to voluntary work, which might be justifiable if it were full-time. However, there is no lower limit to the amount of work done. One or two hours a week, in the principal place of work would be sufficient to qualify a person as a candidate under the provisions of the Bill. In no other sense would it qualify him to seek to represent a community. The hon. Gentleman has taken no steps to tighten this loophole. The only proper way to close the loophole is to delete these two miserable subsections from the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that a man who serves that community in which he, his family and his relations live, must be able to accept the varying patterns and varying needs of the community, be they recreational, work or amenity. The ownership of property, however tenuous, cannot confer a right to stand for a community other than
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1458</span>
that in which one resides. For this reason I hope the Committee will accept these Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Cocks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly to assist the Commitee by giving an example, which I gave during the Second Reading of the Local Authorities (Qualification of Members) Act to which my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Mr. John) referred. This relates to Clause 80(1)(	<i>b</i>). Some years ago a candidate was nominated in Bristol who had no apparent connection with the area by the normal residential qualification. His nomination paper was inspected. It was seen that he was a tenant of 19 Somerset Terrace, Windmill Hill, and that the deeds of this property could be inspected at 13 Orchard Street. No. 19 Somerset Terrace was inspected by interested people who found that it was a bombed site that had been fenced off and was full of builder's salvage and other debris. No. 13 Orchard Street is the headquarters of the Conservative Party in Bristol. It was later admitted that this was a way in which people were qualified to stand for election to the Bristol City Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This parcel of land, a bombed plot, was handed on from one to another like a rotten borough, being held only long enough for the qualification to be valid. One can almost picture a scene whereby if one felt jaded and disqualified from standing for Bristol City Council, never mind, cheer up, a visit to 13 Orchard Street, go in unqualified and come out qualified. The solicitors were on the premises and the whole job could be done on the spot—what one would regard, in industrial terms, as "vertical integration."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whilst the example of grave plots, mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes), valid though it is, might be thought to be stretching the imagination of the Committee a little, here an example of what I regard as an abuse has taken place. I ask hon. Members to take this into consideration when considering these Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Laurance Reed</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find myself in disagreement with my friends opposite. I find that somewhat extraordinary in view of the fact that my reasons for opposing them now are identical to the reasons for supporting them on the last occasion. Our job as legislators is to determine who should be entitled to submit themselves to the electors for considera-

tion for election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not our job as legislators to sit here and say that so-and-so is not a fit, right and proper person to represent X, Y and Z. It is the job of X, Y and Z to decide who is to represent them. We all live in one country and, as an elector, I like to think that I can elect a Welshman or a Scotsman or even an Englishman from another part of the country to be my representative, if I felt that he should represent me. My only consideration would be for me to decide whether the fact that he did not live locally or own property locally was a relevant consideration. The decision should be mine as an elector, and should not be imposed upon me by the arrogance of legislators.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. Gentleman. May I assume that on Report he will table an Amendment to delete paragraphs (	<i>a</i>), (	<i>b</i>), (	<i>c</i>), (	<i>d</i>) and (	<i>e</i>), so that any British subject anywhere can stand for any local authority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Reed</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a proposal to which I would have no objection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sharples</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to have the support of my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, East (Mr. Laurance Reed). I should not go quite so far as that, because while I am all in favour of the widest possible qualifications to stand for local government, I think back to the debate which we had earlier this morning. A person should have some connection with the area which he seeks to represent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Reed</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend not accept that it is for the electors to decide that, not for Parliament? If the electors have the maturity to put us here, surely they have sufficient maturity to decide whether somebody is entitled to represent them locally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sharples</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend will see, I go three quarters of the way with him, but not the whole way. As the right hon. Gentleman and others have said, this is a continuation of a debate which we had in the proceedings leading up to the Representation of the People Act 1969. It is a continuation of a debate which we had on the Local Authorities (Qualification of Members) Bill, in 1970. In the Act of 1971 which that Bill became, so far as the qualifications for standing for election were concerned, and not the qualifications for voting—a sepa-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1460</span>
rate matter—we reverted to the position which had obtained before the introduction of the 1969 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two points on this: first the qualification that a person should be the occupier, as owner or tenant, of land or premises. As the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) pointed out, there are people who might find tenuous reasons for being qualified to stand for a local authority. It is for the electors to point out where tenuous reasons exist. I do not believe that someone living in the centre of London and who owns a holiday cottage will want to stand for councillor in a parish say, in Cornwall. If they did, then I do not believe the people in Cornwall would elect them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The extension—made in the 1970 Act—to the place of work follows a recommendation made by the Maud Committee, on Management. Let me remind this Commitee, as I did in moving the Second Reading of the 1970 Act, of what the Maud Commitee said. In paragraph 424, it said
	<br><q><p>"Our conclusions are that:—</p></q>
	<br><q><p>(a) the present legislation"—</p></q>
legislation wider than it is now is—
	<br><q><p>"makes it difficult for certain people to stand for election and may be the cause of their resorting to arrangements to enable them to satisfy the requirements of the law;
	<ol>
	<li>mobility of people increases; many may have just as much interest in the area in which they work as in the area in which they live and this should be recognised;</li>
	<li>the effect of the law is to exclude some people who might be valuable candidates for election to local authorities, particularly in urban areas."</li></ol></p></q>
5.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They went on in paragraph 425:
	<br><q><p>"We recommend that there be an additional alternative qualification for election to a local authority, namely that the person should have had a principal place of work within the area of the authority during the whole of the 12 months preceding the election."</p></q>
That was the recommendation of the Maud Committee which we implemented in the 1971 Act, extending the right of people to stand for election to local authorities if they wished to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are very good reasons for so doing. We are not extending the right to vote. There are people—let us say owners of garages—who have a direct interest in traffic problems and many other problems. Such a man's service as a councillor can be of great value to the community.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0794">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1461</span>
There is quite a different principle involved concerning the right to vote and it is for that reason that we did not restore that right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas Swain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman agree that where an individual lives outside an area but works in that area, and is elected to the council where he has his place of work he can still bring his influence to bear on the administration in that area if he is sufficiently powerful? He can also bring very strong influence to bear on the area in which he lives? Would not the hon. Gentleman consider this to be undemocratic?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sharples</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He must be a man of tremendous vitality. The man who is elected to a local authority has a tremendous burden of work placed upon him—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must remind the hon. Gentleman that if the Minister gives way for him to ask his question he must be allowed to answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Swain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did listen to the answer, and I am not satisfied with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sharples</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that this is something which faces all political parties. I do not think that there is a great surplus of people in any political party who wish to put themselves forward at every level for election to local authorities. I know quite well that the situation obtains in the Labour Party as it obtains equally in the Conservative Party. I know that from consultations I had with Transport House when I was at Conservative Party Central Office. No party or local authority can afford to rule out entirely the rights of people to stand for election, provided—and this is where I part company with my hon. Friend—they have some interest in the area in which they wish to give service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been our purpose, both in government and opposition, that, in so far as that principle can be achieved, restrictions upon the right to stand for local authority service should be as few as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will turn for a moment to a point raised by the right hon. Gentleman, which applies only to parish councils, and that is the right to stand provided one's residence is within three miles. This is slightly more anomalous. On the other hand, in a rural area particularly, it is of some benefit.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1462</span>
This is something which I know the Parish Councils Association and parishes in general have welcomed up till now. We have received no representations of any kind against this extension of qualification on the grounds of residence—none at all. I think it fair to say that there is no incentive to put oneself forward for membership of a parish council if one's interests do not lie inside that parish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am thinking in particular of a farmer who lives very close to me. The greater part of his farm is in one parish but his house is just a few hundred yards outside. Although it is not a matter of very great importance or principle, I think that in that situation, if he wishes to stand for election, it should be possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally I turn to the Amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Devizes (Mr. Charles Morrison). I appreciate what he is endeavouring to do, but it is contrary to the principle which I have outlined. If people have an interest in an area, they should be allowed to represent the people of that area. With the change in the wider electoral boundaries which we have, the wider qualification to which my hon. Friend referred is probably not of such great importance. Nevertheless, in view of the principle involved, I should not like to see the qualification removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall consider very carefully what my hon. Friend has said, but I cannot accept the principle which lies behind this Amendment. In view of what he said, he might agree to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 518, which the Minister of State has just dealt with, quite rightly in a few words, is nevertheless a kind of litmus paper. It shows the gulf between his side of the Committee and mine. To him, it is not a matter of great principle or moment. He quotes the case of a farmer whose residence is in parish A, but the greater part of whose farm is in parish B, and who wishes to represent parish B. This is the fundamental difference. My hon. Friends and I think that a man should represent the area in which he is resident, not the area in which he has interests, either of land or of work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I were to depart in any way from that principle, which I regard as a democratic test, or litmus paper, I should prefer the free-and-easy method of the hon. Member for Bolton, East (Mr. Laurance Reed).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0795">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1463</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Reed</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman apply that principle to national politics?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Bolton, East has pinpointed the difference to which I have referred. National politics is national politics. Local politics is local politics. If one is dealing with the nation, one can have a constituency anywhere in the country in order to have a link with the nation, but when one is involved with local government, one's link must be local.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Reed</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with that. If I were an elector I should not accept anyone who did not have strong local connections. My point is that the question should be left to the electors. It is not for us, as national politicians, to impose our will on them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel that the answer to that is twofold. I can deal with the first aspect, but the hon. Gentleman may be able to deal with the second during the debate on the next Clause, during which the hon. Gentleman's words will be turned back on him, since what applies to qualification applies equally to disqualification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I concede the logic of the hon. Gentleman's views. An Englishman, a Scotsman, the hon Gentleman or I might, albeit timidly, offer ourselves as candidates for seats in Wales and Scotland. After all, it is all one country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that there is a great deal in what the hon. and learned Gentleman says about urban areas. It is extremely difficult to draw tight boundaries in the country. A man might well have a farm such as my hon. Friend has described. He lives in a particular parish, but it is an isolated farmstead in the country. He attends church in a village with which his family has been associated for generations. Why should we seek to prevent him representing that parish?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's point. He says that that should not be the qualification. He is agreeing with us. but that, too, would be wrong. He also says that it is wrong to limit it to the place of work, and he extends it further by saying that we are wrong in wanting to limit it to residence. But it is perfectly respectable. It falls down, not on the democratic argument, but on the local argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems to me that it is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1464</span>
not only denying a man the right to stand for election, but is denying local electors the right to choose him. This is extremely important in rural areas. There is a basic difference between a rural area and an urban area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that this is as significant as the hon. Gentleman thinks. I live in a rural area, certainly more rural than the hon. Gentleman's constituency. We cannot all claim a specialised knowledge of rural areas. The Minister of State, Home Office, gave a perfectly fair example, but even he would agree that this is exceptional, that it is not something that happens all the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We both have a doctrine on this, but there is a philosophical difference between us. It is that philosophical difference to which I should now turn my attention, but I shall bring the hon. Member for Cannock into it. I think the hon. Gentleman should take the Minister of State, Home Office, outside—I am thinking of something the hon. Gentleman said the other day—and tell him what the 1867 Act was all about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of Slate is still living in a world of total property qualifications. Democracy has slowly begun to thunder ahead. I have great hopes that one day we shall drag the Minister kicking and screaming into the second half of the 19th century. In the meantime, let us look at what he is quoting. First, the fact that one occupies land gives one a greater right to represent the electors of that area than if one does not occupy that land. That seems to me to be an extraordinary proposition if viewed totally dispassionately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once again one comes back to the hon. Member for Bolton, East (Mr. Laurance Reed). I am sorry, but it is a logical argument, and can only be defeated on the local question. One has no more interest in the citizens whom one is called upon or wishes to represent because one happens to own some land than if one does not own some land. One's interest is in the work one does in the community one wishes to serve. In that the hon. Member for Bolton, East and I are at one, but alas, the Minister of State is not with us. He thinks that occupying land gives a person some curious ability to represent a modern democratic community which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0796">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1465</span>
those who do not happen to occupy land should not be allowed to have. That seems to me to be utterly illogical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Reed</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been waiting for an answer to the crux of my argument. It is not that I am opposed to limitations in the qualifications of who should be allowed to stand. All I am saying is that those qualifications should be decided by the electors themselves, and not by us. That is the key question. It is said that a principle is being applied, but the only principle that is being applied is that we are turning to the electors and saying that we do not think they are fit to make a decision of this kind. We are laying down the framework, and they must make their decision within that. That is a big claim for anyone here to make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has gone a little too far along the line, because if he looks at Clause 81 he will see that one of the disqualifications is that a man is bankrupt. If the hon. Gentleman and I have the right to say that because a man is a bankrupt, a felon, a lunatic or an infant that the electorate should not be free to decide whether they want him, I should be interested to hear the hon. Gentleman's views on the disqualification Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Basically, the difference between the hon. Gentleman's point of view and mine is that I take the local qualifications as being important, and here I am at one with the Minister of State. The hon. Gentleman does not take that view. He says that anywhere in the nation will do. I take it that he means just the nation, and not the whole world, and that one will not have President Pompidou contesting a ward in Bolton, East. He will not do so in Deptford if I get my way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point made by the Minister of State rather amused me. The hon. Gentleman quoted Maud, yet when we debated Maud and the unitary principle I got the impression, perhaps erroneously, that hon. Gentlemen opposite were rather opposed to the Maud concept of things. How interesting it is that they should now be selectively happy and be saying "Come into the garden, Maud".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sharples</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two Mauds. It was Maud on "Management of local Government" that I was quoting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point: it is the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1466</span>
wrong Maud, the wrong management, the wrong book. But if we are talking about Maud on Management and not Maud on Local Government, it seems to me that the hon. Gentleman has no authority to speak to us, the elected Members of Parliament, on what are or are not the right qualifications for a councillor. If he is talking about management, I would point out that that is not within his terms of reference. His views are interesting, but they are by no means conclusive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that the Minister of State could have chosen some greater and more knowledgeable authorities in support of his view. When we come down to it, this is a party view. In an odd sort of way I am a little astonished about it, because the party opposite is slowly changing; there is no question about it. It is no longer the squirearchy that it was some years ago. It is now a rather different, Eurocratic sort of Party. One would expect it to have a rather different Eurocratic view of things. I do not like the Eurocratic view of things.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the right hon. Gentleman is going to make a blanket description of this party, will he recognise that there are one or two exceptions, particularly to the Eurocratic point of view?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are one or two very honourable exceptions to that description; I recognise that. There are archaic qualifications for the ability to stand as a councillor, whatever the electorate may do, and the electorate will often elect on party and not on the individual. It is unfortunate, perhaps, but there it is. It really should have no place in the modern reorganisation of local government in Britain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman always deploys a case extremely reasonably, I hope that he will not think that I am being in any way patronising if I say that I almost find myself persuaded whenever he is talking. The thought of his being a Member for Milan, Central or Stuttgart, East at some future date is rather an attractive one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Committee should try to apply a certain test of consistency. This morning we talked about the 18-year-olds. Many people said that whatever view they took on the reference to the Speaker's Conference it was right that in the last analysis
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0797">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1467</span>
the electors should be able to choose an 18-year-old if they so desired. Many hon. Gentlemen said that they did not think that many would be chosen, but that the electors should have the chance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we consider this Clause—and we are concerned with residential qualifications—we should appreciate that there are significant differences between rural and urban areas, and we should try to be as flexible and sensitive to local wishes and demands as we possibly can be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Was the hon.

	<p>in these matters and that, no great sacrifive of democratic principles is involved. I like to think that people are resident in the areas. I reside in my constituency; I believe that Members of Parliament should reside in or near their constituencies.</p>
	<p>It is up to the electors, however, to choose somebody who does, and if they choose somebody who does not, that is their freedom. In this instance we should be doing no damage to democratic traditions by allowing people to elect men such as my hon. Friend's father.</p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 786, in page 50, line 45, at end add:
	<br><q><p>(3) Every person who is nominated as a candidate shall be required to state in his consent to nomination the qualification that he claims and to include such information as will show whether the appropriate requirements of this Act are satisfied in relation to him.</p></q>
I hope that the Commitee will forgive me if I later read those words out, because they are rather relevant to the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment is similar to one that was moved earlier, in the Committee stage of the Local Authorities (Qualification of Members) Bill, on 3rd December, 1970. At that time the hon. Member for Runcorn (Mr. Carlisle)—the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Office—conceded that there was a good case for the Amendment. He made the point in column 336 of the OFFICIAL RFPORT. My memory is that he promised that the Government would bring forward an Amendment on Report. There has been an alteration in the law, but it was by way of a provision which in our view is very weak and does not cover the point at issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment adds to the Clause on qualifications the provision that
	<br><q><p>"Every person who is nominated as a candidate shall be required to state in his consent to nomination the qualification that he claims and to include such information as will show whether the appropriate requirements of this Act are satisfied in relation to him".</p></q>
We have regretfully agreed to leave this Clause virtually as it is in respect of qualifications. The Amendment becomes more necessary because the present position is that only a written statement is required from a candidate that he is qualified—by occupying premises or owning land or working within the area—for his nomination to be approved in the normal way. No proof is required of the truth of the statements, to ensure that a candidate has really fulfilled the qualifications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That seems totally wrong. I hope that the Minister of State, Home Office, can repair the damage done by omission at the time of the previous Act and give us some satisfaction on it. I am not wholly satisfied with the Amendment in my name and in the names of my hon. and right hon. Friends, because it occurs to me that even if it were accepted, while it would
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1470</span>
no doubt go towards the validity of a nomination there would be no sanction against someone who deliberately gave false information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the principle, at any rate, is acceptable to the Minister of State, I would have hoped that one might consider what sanctions would be available in the event of of somebody nevertheless giving false information on the form of consent and proceeding to an election. There are two possibilities; he might be elected, or he might not be elected. I should have thought that the consent might be by form of statutory declaration, so that one could prosecute under the Statutory Declaration Act, 1844, or that some other sanction might be invoked for the giving of false information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment not only is there no sanction against the giving of false information; there is no real test of whether false information is being given at all. There is merely the statement by the candidate that he qualifies under the prevailing sections. I have no doubt that the Government meant to be helpful last time, but I wonder whether the Minister of State can be more positively helpful at this moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1472</span>
employees to be elected as members of the local authority which employs them, on the basis that the normal statutory protection of the declaration of pecuniary interest in Section 76 of the Local Government Act, 1933, which is incorporated in the provisions of Clauses 94 and 95 of the Bill, provides adequate safeguards against abuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This topic was last before the House when it considered the Local Government (Disqualification of Councillors) Bill. The Government then did not completely oppose the principle of extending civic rights but indicated that they would give further consideration to the principle. It would be invidious if a senior local government employee were involved in the formulation of policy and then elected to the authority as a councillor, but I do not think that that argument could be used against the vast majority of employees, such as teachers or local government officers. They are engaged only in the provision of local services, and are far removed from the determination of policy, and it was with the aim of drawing a demarcation line below which, say, a teacher would be eligible for election to his own authority, that I drew up the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the main arguments against a change in the law is that an employee should not place himself in a position to act to his own advantage as a councillor; yet the same argument applies to a builder, an estate agent or any tradesman. I have quoted already the relevant Acts where the pecuniary interest is declared, which acts as a safeguard. One would have thought this should be good enough for the teacher or the local government employee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The I.L.E.A. recently issued new rules of management and articles of governors, making provision for head teachers and representatives of the staff to become members of the governing bodies of schools. For some time teachers in further education have been able to be members of a governing body in the polytechnic in which they were employed. Teachers can be co-opted as members of education committees. It seems illogical that a teacher can serve as a co-opted member on the committee which employs him, but cannot become an elected member of that committee. That is an "Alice in Wonderland" situation which needs to be rectified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1473</span>
The Bill is disquieting in respect of the civic rights of teachers and other local government employees. So far they have been disbarred from election to the county and county borough councils in their areas. As I see it, the provisions in the Bill will make local authority areas larger in some instances. It will not be helpful if Worcestershire and Herefordshire are joined together. There was a chance for someone living just inside the border of Worcestershire to be elected to the council of Worcestershire while employed by Herefordshire as a teacher; but even that way out is likely to cease. It is totally unnecessary to place such a restriction on the democratic functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everyone knows that the average teacher is of good standing in a locality and that he or she can contribute much to the democratic institutions, particularly in the field of their own expertise. Like any other sector of society, they should be able to influence their county council or county borough, with the accepted declaration of interest; and in that way the integrity of the council could be protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have referred to teachers because I know that they are the largest group of local government employees, but for many years they have laboured under this restriction. There is a history to it. Even in 1964 the McNair Report indicated that teachers should be allowed a fuller participation in public affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1958 the then Under-Secretary in the Department of Education, Sir Edward Boyle, now in another place, stated in Column 1297, Volume 587 of THE OFFICIAL REPORT that a review should take place. The Maud Report stated that there should be a liberalisation of the law on disqualification. I should have thought that now was the time for this Amendment to be accepted, to allow teachers and other local government employees the chance to take part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

A building contractor who submits tenders for contracts in a council area can be trusted as council member, but under the Bill a plumber who is employed by the local council cannot be elected to the council. There is little equity or justice in that. There is no doubt that a building contractor on a council could benefit indirectly when, say, he votes for the abolition of the direct labour department; but we trust him. Yet the electrician employed by the authority is not allowed to stand for election to that council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may give another example of the estate agent on the council, he is to be trusted under the provisions of the Bill, yet clearly being on the council enables him to give a better service to his clients. Why not allow the quantity surveyor or the bricklayer employed by the authority to stand for the council? The industrialist whose effluent can pollute streams and rivers is allowed to be elected on to the authority. Why cannot the assistant on the sewage farm employed by the local authority be elected? Why not justice and equity?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The headmaster of a public school is allowed to take part in the deliberations of a local education authority, yet the headmaster in the State system in that area is not. There is a distinct lack of justice here. The wife of a teacher may be elected to a local education authority but not the teacher himself. There are glaring omissions and inconsistencies. The Amendment, if accepted, could put this right. A parent who is cruel to his children can be—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

may represent an area on the local authority, but the social worker or welfare officer is debarred. When one considers the qualities of local government officers or teachers and their capacity to understand problems, one can recognise the injustice of the disqualification as it now stands. I have had a hint from the hon. Gentleman opposite that he wishes to take part in the debate, because he also has hinted at his sympathy and that perhaps he will vote with us on this side of the Committee on the disqualification of councillors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
[Sir STEPHEN MCADDEN in the Chair]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with almost everything that the hon. Gentleman said. I am not sure whether the Amendment as it stands is the right one. We should be extremely careful about this. The hon. Gentleman, in excepting the chief officers, is right. I do not think that it would be correct for chief officers to be members of councils which they serve. There was a lot of justice on the hon. Member's side when he was talking of the new county of Hereford and Worcester. It looks as though we shall be landed with that county whether we like it or not. I was interested in the very persuasive arguments of the hon. Member for Bromsgrove (Mr. Terry Davis), but because of the late arrival of the Herefordshire literature it was not easy for me to join in on that occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take that as a very good example drawn to our attention by the hon. Gentleman. In that new authority, embracing two counties, we could have the automatic disqualification of many people. When we say that between 10 per cent. and 20 per cent. of the people employed in the country are ineligible to serve in local government we are faced with a very serious problem. Local government needs as much expertise, experience and enthusiasm as it can harness to its service, and by ruling out many people who have particular knowledge and enthusiasm we are not doing local government a service. As we are concerned with the reform of local government, and the bringing in of more and better people, we ought to open the gates as wide as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that there are difficulties, and it is right that there should be certain stringent restrictions. It is absolutely right that a teacher sitting on a local authority and employed in a school in that local
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1476</span>
authority area should not vote on controversial educational matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is aware that at present co-opted members have the right to vote on all these matters, but they are not allowed to be elected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman anticipated my remarks. I was coming on to that point in relation to education committees. I am talking now of he full council. It is right that 'we should lay down certain qualifications and say that if one has an interest in the subject under discussion—whether it be financial or through one's employment—one should not vote in any decision about that subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The anomaly exists that a teacher co-opted to an education committee can vote on the formulation of education policy but is excluded from taking any part in the formulation of, say, housing policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed; there are many anomalies, and we can iron many of them out. I was merely making the simple point that in a full council meeting a person who is, for example, a teacher, may be barred from voting on an educational issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That does not invalidate the general good sense of the argument advanced by the hon. Gentleman opposite. I would like to see that general good sense embodied either in this Amendment or in some other form, so that we have a wide degree of eligibility for our local authorities. I urge my right hon. and hon. Friends to take particular account of this. We are engaged in the biggest re-structure of local government that this country has seen in this century; let us make sure that that restructuring does not result in many of the finest, most enterprising and best qualified people being debarred from serving the areas in which they live.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend will appreciate the virtue of the old tag, 	<i>timeo Danaos et dona ferentes,</i> but I assure the

hon. Gentleman that I am not applying that in this case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it would be most dangerous to leave out paragraph (	<i>a</i>) altogether. As to my hon. Friend's Amendment, I can understand his intention and I appreciate the point he is trying to make, but the difficulty I foresee in this is to know where to draw the line in defining chief officers. Who is a chief officer. Is he the head of a department or the deputy? Is he someone who works in the town hall as distinct from a man who drives the dust cart? It is difficult to decide where the line is drawn as between an officer or servant of the council and the chief officer of the council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate what my hon. Friend is trying to do and I have put down a similar Amendment later regarding transport workers. I shall not discuss that Amendment now because it would be out of order. By way of analogy to my hon. Friend's Amendment, however, I can say that those people are deprived of standing for election to an authority which they do not serve because the passenger transport authority happens to be coterminous with the council. That is quite different from the matter that is before us at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Development (Mr. Graham Page)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will deal first with my hon. Friend's Amendment. This provision is embodied in all the legislation to date which separates the officers of the corporation from the members of the corporation. It could happen that a chief officer or, if I may so put it, a stooge of a chief officer could somehow get himself elected to a council as a member and then the distinction of duly-elected members of the council deciding upon policy would
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1478</span>
become blurred by—I shall not say chief officers—senior officers, possibly speaking not entirely on their own behalf but on behalf of a chief officer, having an undue influence as members of the authority in getting those policies through. I know there is quite a lot of support for this Amendment on both sides of the Committee. I only wish to point out the dangers that I foresee in allowing 	<i>carte blanche</i> election of officers of an authority to membership of the authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a question of workers' participation or the like, because if we wanted to do that we could do it by a different formula. We could have representatives of the employees sitting as full members of the council where everybody knew what they were but not being elected as representatives of the public on the council when it would not be clear where their full loyalty lay, whether it was to their chief, their colleagues in the department, their colleagues generally as officers of the authority or to the public who had elected them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The position needs to be tidied up, as I made plain during my speech. Surely, however, the hon. Gentleman would not wish to debar a whole category of people and he would accept the consistency of our argument that the electors should have the choice. Of course they must be told what a man does and they must know what he is. Knowing all the facts—whether he is employed in the transport department or the education office, for example, or whether he is 18 or 80—they elect him. This is the essential point.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I am saying is that it is difficult to know at what point the line is drawn concerning the influence of the officer. This is my main argument. At the risk of upsetting some of my hon. Friends who are Labour and Co-operative Members of the House, I think that one of the faults of co-operative boards has often been that too many employees become members of the boards simply because people do not bother to vote, and they hog and dominate the boards of management to too great an extent. I agree with the hon. Member that the fault is entirely that of members of a cooperative society in not bothering to vote. It arises only for that reason.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept, your ruling, Sir Stephen, but I am drawing the analogy of what could possibly happen as regards voters in a local authority area not bothering to vote and officers who more than anyone else would know the best wards to slip into where there was the least likelihood of a contest. That is the danger I foresee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernest Armstrong</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to put this to my hon. Friend. If we exclude those people from putting themselves forward for nomination, for whatever reason, we could exclude all kinds of people—for instance, anybody who ran a business who might want to sell goods to the corporation. It might be that such people have a stooge or might stand themselves. My hon. Friend has made remarkable contributions to the Committee on the democratic principle. Surely we have enough faith in the judgment of our people to allow them to decide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I am doing—and doing fairly—is drawing to the Committee's attention dangers that could flow from this. We should not be blind to those dangers. We must face them. If we accept the Amendment we must do so knowing the dangers implicit in what we are doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example the town clerk's department, particularly nowadays when the town clerk is the town manager as well, has overall influence on policy, not only within that department but in many other departments of the corporation—indeed, all departments of the corporation coming somehow or other within the policy umbrella. If a representative from the town clerk's department sits as a councillor, he is to some extent sitting on both sides of the camp. I draw this analogy. How would hon. Members in this Committee react to a senior civil servant in the top branch of the Civil Service—in the deputy-secretary grade or something equivalent—sitting as a Member of the House as well as being a civil servant? When one considers the matter from that point of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1480</span>
view and at that level, one sees the difficulties implicit in the Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I go on to what I intended to say in support of my hon. Friend the Member for Flint, East (Mr. Barry Jones). All the analogies he gave to the Committee were in categories in which I should say that those people ought to be allowed to serve on the council. It is a question of drawing the line. I am not happy with my hon. Friend's words "chief officer" because they do not afford a sufficient definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now come to the Amendment with regard to teachers and my Amendment concerning employees of transport authorities. I am certain that here we are getting far too remote from the direct responsibility of the council and its influence on policy in the council. All the arguments that my hon. Friend makes are extremely valid. Particularly with regard to transport workers, the Government are introducing in the Bill an entirely new provision which debars a transport worker from being a member of a county council which is coterminous with his area. We are not recodifying the existing law with regard to the disqualification of members; this is something new which the Government have brought in. It means that a transport worker who is an employee of a passenger transport authority, which has a totally separate corporate existence from a county council as a local authority, but in itself is not a local authority, is debarred. The sole reason for his being debarred is that the passenger transport authority's area is coterminous with that of the county council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, this is going much too far. I agree with my hon. Friend the hon Member for Cardiff, North (Mr. Michael Roberts), who said that teacher representatives on the council can debate education policy, for which it is said they have direct concern, but they are debarred from standing for election to discuss anything else. The question is where the line is to be drawn. I should draw it a little lower down than "chief officers", which is suggested in the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have considerable sympathy with the Amendment in the name of the Member for Flint, East (Mr. Barry Jones), because it would enable a large number of people in the community to stand for election to the council, and that is something to which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0804">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1481</span>
we should give consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a city of about 250,000 people, one would expect between 2,000 and 3,000 teachers to be working for the local authority. At present they are precluded from standing for election, to the detriment of good local government. I submit that teachers are particularly well qualified to serve in public affairs. To support that view one has only to look at the composition of the Committee. There are at least four ex-teachers on each side. Teachers represent a number of constituencies throughout the country. If they are qualified to serve the interests of the nation at Westminster, we should consider using their services in city and county halls, and on the new councils that will be elected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only are teachers well qualified to serve on councils, but they have a tradition of service. Many groups in our society have the qualifications for public service, but few have a better tradition of service to the community—which is a sound basis for going on to serve on a local council—than the teaching profession. Teachers are involved in every aspect of local life—in the youth service, in social work. Not long ago hon. Members were talking about association football teams. Perhaps I may tell the Committee that such is the talent of teachers in the world of sport that nine members of the victorious Welsh Rugby XV are ex-members of the teach-ins profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said at the beginning that I had sympathy with the Amendment because it would enable a great pool of talent to be utilised by the electors if teachers could stand for election and be allowed serve the community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alec Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman intended to go much further, but he knows that as an ex-teacher I should agree with him, myself. Would he not agree, however, that this pool of talent is just as likely to be found in other branches of the public service, too. The hon. Gentleman said that few people have a better tradition of service. I do not quarrel with that, but I say that other branches of the public service have as good a tradition—gravediggers, carpenters, and so on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman, but I was illustrating my argument with the group in the com-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1482</span>
munity which I know best.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, and having embraced other elements in the public service, I must say that I have grave reservations about the Amendment, and here I follow the line of the thoughts of the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes). It is a question of where to draw the line. If one excludes just the chief officials—and again I use the education service as an example—one excludes the director of education, and quite rightly so, but one does not, presumably, exclude the deputy director, or the assistant director. That is why I find it difficult to support the Amendment. I hope that the matter will be considered carefully so that some way can be found to use the services of teachers in the public service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Cardiff, North (Mr. Michael Roberts) gave me the impression that he wanted the best of both worlds. He spoke as though he was trying to satisfy the teachers, but not to offend his Front Bench, but he qualified that and said that, whatever his own opinion, he would vote for whatever his Front Bench said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have found the debate very interesting, and I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Flint, East (Mr. Barry Jones) on the way in which he introduced the Amendment. The June, 1971, census of workers in local authorities revealed that 2,466,488 employees are restricted from serving on their own local body. That figure represents 11 per cent. of all the registered workers in Great Britain. In 1966 the percentage was 9.1, and we are therefore dealing with an upward trend in the number of people who are employed in local government. The Amendment, therefore, is of the first concern to a large proportion of our electorate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Manchester, about 30,000 people working for the local authority, directly or indirectly, are disqualified from serving on it. No doubt in the City of Cardiff there are at least 10,000 people who, because they give public service to the local authority, are not allowed to serve on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have indicated the anomalies which arise. There was a special reference to the anomaly that teachers may vote on matters in which they have a personal interest, but are not allowed to give their services in many other respects. I am
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0805">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1483</span>
sure that it is the will of the majority of the Committee that the Minister should be forthcoming in his reply, which I hope will not be long delayed—[Hon. Members: No.]—We should not be offensive to the Minister; we should give him his chance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Government's proposals it is a disqualification for employees of any body to which the local authority appoints a representative and in the counties, it is a disqualification for many employees of passenger transport authorities. In South Wales we have a joint water board, which the Minister of State will be well acquainted with. Many authorities contribute to this; they are represented on it. No one authority has a majority over all the rest. Those who work for the joint water board are precluded from giving their services in local government, because their local authority is represented on the joint water board. The same applies to joint cremation boards and joint burial boards. We are robbing the public of a reservoir of ability. We are needlessly punishing ourselves by preventing people, who ought to be serving local government, from coming forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State, Home Office, told us this morning that the Conservative Party, like the Labour Party, finds difficulty in getting the right people to come forward as candidates for local government. We know that is true. It is probabfy also true of the Liberals. It is increasingly difficult to get people to give their time. Yet the Government's proposals add restrictions to prevent people from serving in local government. They will add many thousands, at least, to the number of people who are prevented from coming forward to give service to local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new large authorities created by this Measure add to the problem. At one time a large number of people could live in one area and work in another. It will be true of far fewer in the future, if this Measure reaches the Statute Book. People who have been entitled to serve in local government because they lived in one area and worked in another will now find that at least service on the top authority will be closed to them, because the vast area of the new authorities means that they are now living under the roof
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1484</span>
of their employer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour Government White Paper clearly indicated that we wanted a change in the existing rigid disqualification. I am astounded that the Government are adding to the disqualifications, making it even harder for people to play their part. I want to quote one sentence from our White Paper:
	<br><q><p>"In the Government's view"</p></q>
that was the Labour Government's view—
	<br><q><p>"a liberalisation of the law on disqualification is desirable."</p></q>
They proposed to discuss the matter with local authorities and others concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the qualification of councillors was discussed in December, 1970 the Under-Secretary at the Home Office gave an undertaking on behalf of the Government that there would be the widest consultation on this question before the Local Government Bill came forward. The Minister of State will be aware of the undertaking. The Under-Secretary went further. He thought it was wrong just to deal with teachers or different groups, and that it was better to deal with the whole exclusion, which is what I support. This is what we propose in the Amendment. I hope that the Minister of State will be able to tell us whether his consultations on the qualifications extended to the trade union movement as well as to local authority organisations. I understand from the Under-Secretary's statement that local authorities are against the proposal to extend the franchise. I can understand that, because they have a vested interest in the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Has the Minister of State consulted the Transport and General Workers Union, the Municipal and General Workers Union, N.A.L.G.O., the National Union of Teachers and the Association of Teachers in Colleges and Departments of Education? The Bill introduces a restriction on lecturers in colleges of education for the first time. At present, because they are appointed by the principal, they are able to serve on local authorities if they so desire. In future, any paid officer of the local authority who appoints, is considered to be the local authority. It is possible that we shall lose the services of these people who, in many instances, have a flair for administration and a willingness to serve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to extend the argument too long. We listened at length to my

hon. Friend the Member for Widnes. Was it he who said, "Hear, hear"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oakes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not I!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I always find it a pleasure to address my remarks to you, Sir Stephen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, thanks to the Education (No. 2) Act, 1968, most staff in maintained colleges of education are not disqualified from service in local government. If the Bill is passed, disqualification follows, if the appointment is made by some person already holding office with the authority. As my hon. Friend mentioned, the staff in voluntary colleges will be allowed to serve. This is a serious anomaly; it is an absurd anomaly and I believe it is an injustice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the Minister of State will answer this question. Why should we tell those engaged in local government that they cannot serve on local authorities? Is the implication that if they did, they would use the office for their personal advantage—that must be the fear—that they would have undue influence on the other councillors or that they would see opportunies for advancing their personal interest? I believe that this is highly offensive to honourable people engaged in local government. We should put greater trust on those who serve in local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Flint, East (Mr. Barry Jones) referred to some of the remarkable people who are allowed to take part in local government. Unless Cardiff is different from other parts of the country, we all know people who use the local authority for their personal advantage. They are within the law; they are elected and re-elected. It is astonishing to me that they get re-elected. To tell the man who works in the architect's department of the council, or the teacher, or the bus driver, or the others engaged on local authority work, that they cannot be trusted to serve in local government is, in by opinion, a very serious offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1486</span>
To me it is a democratic offence that 11 per cent. of our people are denied the right to serve; I also find something personally offensive in the suggestion that social workers, welfare workers, teachers, and the like, should be told that because the only place for their service is under the local authority umbrella they must never be allowed to participate in local government. There is something very wrong in allowing such a principle to be established. These people have no alternative sources, unless it be the very small privileged circle of the public school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to go into that question, because I hope that hon. Gentlemen opposite with a sense of justice will support the liberation of local authority workers so that they may serve in local government. For social workers, welfare workers and teachers the field is rather limited; they can serve only if they are appointed by a local authority. It would be an offence to democracy if part of the price that these honourable people have to pay were that they could not submit themselves for election to local government by their fellow citizens. That consideration applies also to the vast army of people who are engaged in other local government work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude with a reminder to hon. Gentlemen of what they were saying earlier—"Let the electors decide". My right hon. Friend expressed warm sympathy with that great principle when we were talking of qualifications. The party opposite was arguing that the electorate should decide. Why not let them decide whether they want a local bus driver, a local teacher or somebody working for local government? They will all know where he works.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cormack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows my sympathies, but I must remind him that in a previous division he and his colleagues voted against the electorate's deciding that because a person happened to have a farm 200 yards away he could be a councillor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not worry about my conscience. I am worried about his. It was either he or one of his hon. Friends who said, "We are not only denying the man the right to stand for election; we are denying the electorate the right to choose him". We propose to put that right. I

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1487</span>
believe that throughout the town halls of Great Britain and the local authority service there will be support for the Amendment moved by my hon. Friend and the Amendment in the name of my right hon. and hon. Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After the eloquence of Wales today I felt very much inclined to pass this along the road to my hon. Friend the Minister of State for Wales—[	<i>Laughter.</i>] who, as I was about to say has deserted me. I must do the best I can against the great force from Wales that we have seen today. The right hon. Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. George Thomas) made some extremely important points at the outset of his speech when he told us that nearly 2½ million people were employed in local authority work. When I asked my officials how many people we were talking about, they said it was 2½ million. I then asked what we would reduce that figure to in our reform of local government, and cynically the official told me that it would be 3½ million!
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We may be talking about a substantial number of people who are unable to stand because of these rules. Is it right for us to relieve them of those restrictions—or is it of great importance that local government employees should not serve as members of their own employing authority. That is really the basis of our discussion. Our present reforms will increase the field for service by local authority employees as councillors, since, with a two-tier system, an employee of the county council will be able to serve as a member in his own district or, vice versa, if he is employed by his own district he will be able to serve as a councillor on a county council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To some extent, therefore, we are extending the field of service. The right hon. Member for Cardiff, West, referred to his own Government's intention to liberalise the law in this respect. That was in connection with their policy for unitary authorities, which would have cut down the field, whereas we are extending it as a result of our present local government reform.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the Minister agree that there is a two-tier system in most of the country now, so that exactly the same
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1488</span>
consideration applies? He is not extending or giving anything.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was merely comparing the results which would have occurred from a reform under the Labour Government as compared with the reform taking place now. As a side-line of our reform, we shall retain the present system whereby a person can serve in the area where he lives if he is not employed by that local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These Clauses are intended to consolidate existing provisions. I readily admit that we have not gone forward with any great reforms in this field. Changes have been made, as hon. Members have mentioned in the course of this debate, to remove areas of doubt in the existing legislation, to correct anomalies, and to adapt the provisions to the new local government structure. As hon. Members have pointed out, there are still anomalies. The intention behind these Clauses, and our repeat of them in a consolidated form, is to ensure the probity and integrity of local government both in fact and in appearance. As the Bill is set out, the disqualifications can arise on two main counts—either by virtue of the employment of the person seeking to become a councillor or as the result of some personal action. We are not concerned with the second class—the bankrupts, and so on; in these Amendments we are concerned only with a person's employment. I must put this point to the Committee as a basis on which we drafted the Clauses as they stand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill maintains the long-established principle that an employee of a local authority shall not be eligible for membership of that authority. It is one which one ought not to be changed lightly. I am glad that we are having a debate on it to see whether we ought to have changed it or whether it was right to abide by that principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commitee will forgive me if I read paragraph 49 of the Government White Paper of February, 1971. It states the position succinctly, saying:
	<br><q><p>"Under the present law an employee of a local authority may not stand for election to his employing council. This is an accepted rule, designed to prevent even the appearance of a conflict betwen an individual's public duty as a member and his private interest as an employee. The Government are clear that this rule should be retained in the wider public
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0808">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1489</span>
interest. Their proposals to reorganise local government on the basis of two executive levels everywhere will mean that local government employees, although still debarred from serving on their employing authority, will normally have the chance to stand for election to the other authority within whose area they live. At present, an employee of a county borough who lives in the town has no such alternative possibility open to him. In practice, therefore, the proposals for reform will increase the opportunities for local government service."</p></q>
I read that paragraph in full because I intend to read the next short paragraph paragraph 50—which says:
	<br><q><p>"The Government would be prepared, however, to consider proposals on detailed points relating to the application of the present law."</p></q>
The Amendments go to the root and branch of the present law. They are not a mere tidying up of the law. I accept them as attacking the whole principle that an employee of a local government authority should not be allowed to stand as a member of that authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, I cannot go all that way, root and branch. There is a great field where we ought not to change the law, or even to consder changing the law. I find one of the greatest complaints against our councils is that they are run by the officials. Many people outside the councils, who perhaps have never had the chance to serve as members, believe their local councillors are run by the officials of the town hall. That is a complaint which would increase if it were known that those officials could themselves stand as members. Surely we ought to retain the position of the elected member, with his independent voice, being advised by his officials.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it would be impossible to change the established law, so far as any officials who advise the members are concerned, or indeed any employees close to the administration of the council. All those who people broadly call "them at the town hall". I do not see how we can possibly alter the law so far as they are concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the other end of the scale, of course one comes to the labourers employed by the council; the bus drivers have been mentioned, and so on. It may seem illogical, perhaps, that they should be deprived of the right to offer themselves to the electorate for election as a councillor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for making employees of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1490</span>
the Passenger Transport Executive subject to these disqualifications is that under the Bill the metropolitan county becomes the passenger transport authority. Therefore, anyone employed by the Passenger Transport Executive is really employed by the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is mere consolidation and amendment to bring them within the general ambit of the present law. I am not arguing whether it is right, or wrong at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much has been said about the teachers. I have found that it is almost impossible to ascertain exactly what the law is relating to the teachers and who can stand and who cannot stand for membership of councils. There are exceptions which have been recognised throughout legislation for some time. The Bill has endeavoured to iron out the anomalies relating to teachers and retain the exemptions which they already have and which are set out in Clause 82(3) and (4).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) deals with those exemptions from disqualification which apply in Greater London and subsection (4) seeks to relieve teachers when serving on committees of a district council when they are employed by the county council or 	<i>vice versa.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is pure consolidation and we thought it right, in drawing the Bill to apply the existing law, the established custom, that employees of local authorities cannot stand as members of their own employing authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) and my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North (Mr. Michael Roberts) said, if one is going to decide that a certain number of employees of the local authority are so remote from the elected member that it is folly to say that they will have a wrong influence on the council itself if they are elected, that they will use their position to further their own ends, then it is difficult to know where to draw the line. I have vaguely drawn the line at two extremes, perhaps—those who advise and serve the council who obviously should be excluded from membership of the council, and those right at the other end who are manual workers for the council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot see that any of the Amendments deal with the sort of thing I have in mind and, therefore. I cannot hold out any hope of any of this group of Amend-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0809">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1491</span>
ments being accepted. I am grateful for the debate which has occurred. I think it has thrown a great deal of light on this problem and how hon. and right hon. Members feel about it. It is quite obvious that we ought to examine it to see whether we can give any relief to the worker who is so remote from the council as not to be affected in any way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot hold out any prospect that I have anything in my mind as to where to draw the line. I should like to be advised further on this and think about it further to see to what extent I could carry with me any of the local authority associations which, I assure the Committee, are dead against any revision of this at the present time. There is no question but that the local authority associations would wish to keep the long established custom embodied in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I take the feeling of the Committee and those hon. and right hon. Members who have spoken this afternoon and, in view of what has been said, I obviously could not refuse to look at the matter again in some detail. But I should have to abide by the sort of thing that was said in the White Paper—and I quote again—

It would not be an abandonment of what I believe to be the right principle, that the

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is very lucky I rose, because I did not take it as a joke. Will the Minister indicate what his advice was? How many will be added to the total of 2½ million?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I rose to ask the Minister also whether he will, before Report, find a formula which will enable people such as bus drivers, teachers, and social welfare Workers—people who do not advise the local authority at first hand—to have the freedom enjoyed by the rest of us to serve the community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7.0 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will tidy up these figures right away. I have never professed to be a comedian. When I try to make a joke, people never laugh. [	<i>Laughter.</i>] I do not mind when they do not laugh, but I am upset if they take it seriously. My own belief is that we shall reduce that 2½ million and bring it down to 1½ million employed by local authorities, over a period of years. I do not want to throw a million out of work right away, but I hope that over a period of years we shall streamline local authority service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that, at a certain level of employment or in a certain area of employment by a local authority, if an employee stands as a member, there is any serious chance of failure of integrity or lack of probity. As has been pointed out, there are many occasions where a person employed in private undertakings becomes a member and he may be just as suspect. There is a wide area where the employee of the local authority cannot possibly be said to be suspect if he becomes a member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not base the argument on that. I base it more: on the point the right hon. Gentleman picked up just now of their advising the council, as being part of the body so close to the council that they can be influenced on the council and in their executive capacity. That is more or less how I should like' to think of any possibility of meeting the Opposition on these Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cocks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be very brief, because much of the ground has been covered. First, I should tell the Committee that I am a member of the General and Municipal Workers' Union, which has a very large number of employees in local authority service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought that the remarks of the Minister of State, Home Office in a previous debate, about there being no great surplus of councillors or potential councillors, would have led the Minister to give this series of Amendments very serious thought. I am a little encouraged by his remark, which shows that the door is not entirely closed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new authorities which are being created will be so large, not only in population, but also in area, that to some extent there is a danger that councillors may not be entirely 	<i>au fait</i> with every situation. The Maud Report on the Management of Local Government, Volume 5, page 186, talks about the very great influence which the chairman and the chief officer wield. Maud says that there is a danger
	<br><q><p>"of a powerful chairman and a powerful officer combining … to hoodwink a committee."</p></q>
I think this is to some extent a response to the very great size, particularly in the county council areas where this danger was more prevalant than elsewhere. Council members have to travel such great distances to meetings that they are often separated from each other by great distances and it is not possible to have intimate discussions about things as often as one would wish. So a great deal of power falls into the bands of the chairman and the chief officer, and it can sometimes be misused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A very powerful safety valve against this possible misuse would be to have some councillors who have intimate inside knowledge of the workings of the council. In my short stay in Parliament, I have had the experience, which I am sure a number of other hon. Members will have had, of being prompted to table certain Questions and follow up certain leads from inside information which one is given about the working of some organisation. It would be a powerful counterbalance to this danger in large authorities of too much power falling into the hands of the chairman and the chief officer if
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1494</span>
people were allowed to stand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could not the candidates come from those who serve as employees of another local authority? Would it not be dangerous for this principle to be accepted in the case of employees of the local authority of which they are members?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cocks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I go part way with the Minister on this, but I feel that, although the mechanics would be common to many authorities, particular situations would be known only to people actually serving within the authority itself. We should think of interest in wider terms than simply being associated with wage and salary earners. The voluminous notes which the Minister was kind enough to supply to us on Clause 94, to which I have tabled an Amendment, give an example of direct and indirect interests. It is said that, for example, an employee may have an interest in a proposed contract because it is with his firm—an indirect interest—or because it would mean overtime for him—a direct interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a most significant example, because it shows the Government's obsession with the fact that interest is identified solely with people who draw either salary or wage. The interests which cause 	<i>causes célèbres</i> in newspaper reports are concerned with planning decisions, with the disposal of land, and with the abuses which are possible through knowledge of this sort. It is about time that we realised that by and large people in local affairs are of very great probity and the way in which direct interest can be influenced by decisions of the council is extremely remote. I submit to the Minister that where these cases are possible it is covered by Clause 94, which is one of the Amendments in my name.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We listened to the Minster of State with great care. He has clearly been impressed by the arguments advanced by both sides of the Committee. He did not go as far as we should have liked him to, but it is unreasonable not to allow him an opportunity to go into this matter between now and Report in greater depth and bring his solution before the House at that stage. I hope, therefore, that my hon. Friend will feel that, having had a first-class debate, he can now ask leave to withdraw the Amendment, on the understanding that

The Amendment is designed purely to correct what I think is a typographical error.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot accept this—not that it would wreck the Bill but because it should be not "an" but "a". It should not be "any". That misprint is taken up by the printer, so I cannot accept the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am satisfied that this correction will be seen to, and therefore I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for indicating this point.
