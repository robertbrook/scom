<p>[<i>Mr. Barry Jones.</i>]</p>
<p>4.30 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roger Moate</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When we arose this morning I was explaining that there was total opposition to the Thameside proposal from the area that I represent.<br><br>
When the Maud proposals and, subsequently, the Labour Government proposals, were published there was great opposition to the idea of Kent's being divided into two unitary authorities, because it had made sense as an administrative and geographical whole. The proposals meant that large numbers of freestanding boroughs and towns would be submerged in large unitary authorities of about half a million people. Consequently,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 646</span>
when the Conservative Government's proposals were published they were widely welcomed, because they enabled the Kent Council to remain as one unit, using the flexibility of the second tier to enable many small authorities to combine to create a sensibly-sized unit.<br><br>
That process was proceeding satisfactorily in my area, in which local authorities combined to set up steering committees to enable them to work towards a sensible reform of local government. Then, out of the blue, came a proposal from across the Thames estuary that Kent should be carved into two; that our towns should be merged into a unit with the Medway towns and that we should be linked with an area about 16 miles away, across the Thames Estuary—I doubt whether it is visible on a clear day—an area with which we have no community interest.<br><br>
I am sure that hon. Members will understand why the idea was received with some scepticism. I have no wish to be unduly critical of Southend—with you in the Chair, Sir Stephen, that would be undiplomatic—but it was not merely the nature of the proposals that excited opposition; it was the way in which they were put forward.<br><br>
Our local authorities heard of the proposal in the first place through a Press release issued by Southend. The authorities were not consulted, which indicates that these were eleventh-hour proposals, produced out of a desperate desire to create a new entity to give more power to Southend and the Medway towns: Although I sympathise with that desire I suggest that the proposition is impractical.<br><br>
I refer to the letter that indicates the way in which the proposals were received in our area. It was a reply by the clerk of one of the councils to the Town Clerk of Southend. Hon. Members will be aware of the normal diplomatic and careful language used by town clerks and will recognise its use in the letter, which says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Dear Mr. Laws.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Your Council's methods appear to be as deplorable as your scheme is crackbrained and we shall oppose it by every means at our disposal."</p></blockquote>
That was an official missive from one council to another. Although the others were not couched in exactly the same language the message was essentially similar.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0357">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 647</span>
It appears that the Medway towns and Southend together have contrived to put forward essentially an artificial reaction in order to give to themselves rather more powers than would have been allowed to them under the Bill as drafted. We understand and sympathise with these desires, but this Thameside proposal is just not on.<br><br>
To put it in the context of the philosophy behind the Government's proposals when they considered other metropolitan counties, this morning the Minister, in answering another debate, made that point when referring to a continuously built-up area. During the Second Reading debate, when defining metropolitan counties, he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"It was a matter of defining the boundary of a conurbation, the areas of towns built together beside one another, part and parcel of the same community."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 15th November, 1971; Vol. 826, <i>c.</i> 343.]</p></blockquote>
He then went on to refer to communities for the new metropolitan districts of about a quarter of a million.<br><br>
By no stretch of the imagination can this area of Thameside be described as a continuously built-up conurbation. For a start, there are many miles of estuary between the two sides of it, and even then there is not a continuous conurbation on either side of the estuary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Member oppose Humberside on those grounds?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moate</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are exceptions. I am quite prepared to concede that but I do not think that he will agree that on Humberside there is a 16-mile estuarial point, as there is between Faversham and Southend. There is nothing comparable to that in the Humberside proposals. That is the point.<br><br>
It is just possible that if one went right up the estuary—say, to Gravesend and Tilbury—one might find a proximity and a community of interest in riverside industries that represented a proper base for local government, but by no stretch of the imagination does that exist as far up the estuary as Southend, or Faversham on the other side—or even the Isle of Sheppey.<br><br>
One could argue that there is a case for Thameside-based authorities higher up the river, but I am not sure that that would
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 648</span>
please the Southend authority, which has been the main promoter of this area.<br><br>
Equally, the Medway towns are some miles away from the River Thames. They form a Medway-based conurbation. By river, they are about twelve miles away from the River Thames. So it is by no means a natural estuary, with comparable industries on either side, representing shipbuilding, docks or other waterside activities.<br><br>
There are many exceptions, and they will probably grow. The Medway is a flourishing and fast-expanding port. Many hon. Members are probably not aware how rapidly the River Medway is approaching the position of being one of our most important ports. Later on, the Southend, Shoeburyness and Foulness plans will produce a major docks complex, depending upon the Government's decision, to be announced later, but these will be largely competing and not complementary interests, and do not justify the idea of a common authority.<br><br>
None of the original criteria which the Government laid down for new authorities is satisfied by the Thameside proposals. It has been broadly accepted by both sides of the Committee that the new authorities should be related to areas within which people have a common interest. That certainly does not exist across the estuary. It was important for the whole system to be understood and accepted as sensible by the electors—and that certainly does not apply here. The Faversham constituency has nothing in common with Southend, and Chatham, Rochester and Gillingham have had very little in common with Southend—except a desire to acquire rather more powers under local government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>John Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hate to keep interrupting the hon. Gentleman. I am very interested in what he is saying. He always talks a lot of sense. Amendments Nos. 426 and 441 are in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper), who is also indisposed today. I wonder whether the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) would change his mind about the general proposal if he examined the suggestion for District (<i>e</i>) in Amendment No. 441. I am interested only from the point of view of information. I have not finally made up my mind on this question.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0358">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 649</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moate</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was going to make the point that even if there were any merit in the Thameside proposal—and I would deny that, in general terms—there is certainly no case for the inclusion of Faversham, Sittingbourne, Swale and Sheppey. I concede the point that the right hon. Gentleman made, but it is only a matter of degree, because I cannot see even a remote connection between the Medway towns and Southend—and those are the two principal planks for creating a new metropolitan county because they would be the two dominant metropolitan districts.<br><br>
This suggested area is an artificial creation, put together largely for the purpose of giving extra powers to certain local authorities, which understandably desire them. I welcome the principle of two-tier government in Kent, but I readily recognise that it is impossible to concede to certain authorities in the Medway area effective unitary powers—powers which have been denied even under Labour Government proposals—without effectively destroying the whole system of two-tier government as it is proposed.<br><br>
I want briefly to refer to one or two other points. First, there is the question of Foulness Airport, which it is felt will be a major expansion factor, creating immense industrial and residential expansion in Essex as well as considerably affecting Kent. That is certainly true in terms of aircraft noise, although we are relying on the Government to put forward proposals so helpful to Kent that it will not suffer from undue noise.<br><br>
On planning grounds I should have thought that the creation of Foulness Airport, with its resulting vast influence on the hinterland, was the most powerful argument in favour of keeping Essex intact as an administrative county. The new development will affect the whole of Essex, which means that it is vital for that county to retain control of all the planning factors which emanate from the creation of the airport, the docks and, possibly, the industrial site.<br><br>
I am in agrement with the proposers of the Amendment on the question of the cross-Channel link. I have long been an advocate of a bridge or tunnel at a wide point in the estuary. A bridge is quite feasible. The possibility has been investigated and found to be technically practicable between, for example, the Isle of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 650</span>
Sheppey and Southend. That would be an enormously valuable contribution to the economy of the country and would create great wealth at both ends of such a link.<br><br>
However, the creation of such a link does not automatically necessitate a single authority. That has not been the case in other areas. Nor would the creation of a Channel Tunnel necessitate a joint local authority between Calais and Dover. These things are justifiable on their own grounds. I hope, therefore, that the Government will one day come forward with bold and imaginative plans for a new, economically viable link across the Thames Estuary, whereby traffic could emerge from the Channel Tunnel, by-pass London and travel direct to the Midlands or the North—a project that would greatly benefit Kent and Essex in particular, and the country in general.<br><br>
The acceptance of the Thameside concept would make a nonsense of the whole principle of the Bill. We are seeking a two-tier—or two-sphere—system in most areas, with the metropolitan county principle reserved to the large conurbations, of which this is certainly not one. In conclusion, I quote from a letter written by the Clerk to the Sittingbourne and Milton Urban District Council. He states that:
<br><blockquote><p>"Embracing parts of north Kent and south Essex in a new county would be an entirely artificial creation and would do violence to both existing counties which have distinct identities and are of the size to form strong principal county units under the reorganisation. The proposal would not contribute anything of significance to the prosperity, development or provision of services in the area which could not be equally effectively achieved within the county structure proposed in the Bill."</p></blockquote>
I welcome the Government proposals for Kent. I therefore hope that the Committee will reject this proposal, which would contribute nothing to the effective reform of local government in Kent or Essex.</span></p>
<p>4.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You have displayed the greatest patience as Chairman of the Committee for so many Sittings, Sir Stephen. Your patience must have been particularly tried today, since the Committee is discussing matters in which, although you must obey the rule of silence of the Chair, you have a constituency interest and with which no doubt you are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0359">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 651</span>
passionately concerned.<br><br>
I support the proposals for a Thameside authority, and I wish formally to move Amendment No. 441, in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not necessary to move the Amendment. It is being discussed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Sir Stephen. As my right hon. Friend has said, my hon. Friend the Member for Farnworth is on the sick list. The differences between Amendment No. 441 and Amendment No. 426 are differences only in terms of areas. The principle involved is the same—namely, the creation of a metropolitan county on Tyneside, but hon. Members will see that in relation to the Kent side Amendment No. 441 does not include the whole of the rural district of Dartford.<br><br>
Certain parishes only of that rural district are included in the proposed metropolitan area. Nor does it include the hon. Gentleman's constituency, or Queen-borough in Sheppey, or the various urban districts and rural districts, particularly the rural district of Swale which is mentioned in District (<i>e</i>) of Amendment No. 426. So, although the principles are the same, this is a smaller area. It might therefore go some way to meet the objections of the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate). Not only is his constituency not included; under Amendment No. 441 many of the authorities which have expressed opposition to any proposed metropolitan area do not find themselves in a metropolitan area.<br><br>
I do not know which anonymous town clerk sent the constructive and well-argued reply to the Town Clerk of Southend, but I hope that he is in one of the authorities which will not be included under Amendment No. 441.<br><br>
I base my support for the Amendments on two statements of the Secretary of State. In the Second Reading debate both he and the Minister argued that rivers are unifying rather than dividing geographical features, in terms of local government. That is the tenor of the Bill. One sees it in the creation of Humberside, although for different reasons. The proposal there is for a non-metropolitan county. One sees it in the proposed county of Avon. One sees it in Tyneside—which is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 652</span>
on all fours with this proposal and one sees it on Merseyside.<br><br>
The very names of the proposed metropolitan or non-metropolitan county councils indicate that in many instances in the creation of a new authority the river has been the physical feature which has even given the name to the new authority. These proposals would set up a Thamesside on the major river of this country—the Thames—in similar circumstances to so many other authorities. That is one point, that, according to the Secretary of State, rivers should no longer be regarded as dividing local authorities but as the means of uniting interests and local authorities. With that I basically agree.<br><br>
The other statement which the Secretary of State made very clear in the Second Reading debate, and which has been echoed often in the Committee, is that in the Bill we are not just legislating for the present; we are certainly not legislating for the past, and what we must always have our eyes on is the immediate and the middle future. The provisions which we are making today will be in force certainly for the next quarter of a century, possibly for the next half century, and perhaps even for a century. Those are the geographical units which we are deciding upon in the Committee.<br><br>
In moving his Amendment my hon. Friend the Member for Flint, East (Mr. Barry Jones) made it very clear that we are dealing with an area in which there will be a population explosion. Many of the arguments which the hon. Member for Faversham has put forward—the Committee always treats with great respect what an hon. Member says with regard to his own constituency or its immediate area, and I certainly listened very closely to the hon. Gentleman's arguments—have suffered from the defect that he tended to concern himself with what is now, and not what is to be.<br><br>
The basic argument of my hon. Friend the Member for Flint, East, which ran like a thread throughout his whole case, was the development of this area. The present population is about 1,200,000, and the population in the immediate future is likely to increase so rapidly that we can think of doubling that figure in a few years. We can think in those terms because of the natural drift to the South-East which he and I know, to our cost, affects our own areas. The most important
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0360">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 653</span>
feature for the Committee when dealing with this area is the proposals for the tremendous complex at Foulness, which is likely to include not only the third London airport but, with vision, a major part and the creation of a major industrial area—possibly, it has been argued by some people, the creation of a duty-free port in this area. What will result from a third airport and a huge dock complex in the Foulness area is a tremendous influx of industry and population to the shores of the Thames.<br><br>
There are, therefore, two arguments that should lead the Committee to look to the future, bearing in mind the Minister's well-reasoned case that rivers should be a uniting, not a dividing, factor, and his proper concern that what we are doing in this Committee shall stand the test of time. Therefore, the arguments in regard to Foulness, with regard to a further bridge or further means of communication between the north and south banks of the Thames at this point, and the argument which arises if hon. Gentlemen opposite are successful on Thursday—which I profoundly hope they will not be—will mean that there will be a concentration of industry, resources and people particularly in this area. These are the facts that we should be looking at in deciding the type of authority that we shall have along the banks of the Thames.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Flint, East (Mr. Barry Jones) described the counties of Essex and Kent, so far as the development of the river banks is concerned, as rump counties. He apologised to the Committee, but I do not think an apology is needed. Basically, the Essex County Council and the Kent County Council have considerable experience about agricultural matters. They may also have some experience about residential-type suburbs. But they have very little knowledge of industrial factors affecting their areas, particularly the difficulties of extractive industries, whether they be clay, gravel or chalk.<br><br>
Both sides of the principal river leading to the capital city of Great Britain are blighted for most of their length, because of the complete neglect in the past of those county councils, which will, under the Bill, retain overall planning control for the banks of the River Thames.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moate</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are problems on
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 654</span>
both sides of the Thames, with the decline principally of many of our basic industries—cement, bricks, paper, and so on. But the problem is created not by the county councils and local authorities, which are very experienced in these matters, but by the regional policies that prevent the influx of new industries into the South-East to replace these basic industries, which are in considerable difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I disagree. It is not only a question of attracting new industry, important though that is. The hon. Gentleman talks about the attraction of new industry. Merseyside and Welsh Members are amazed at the way in which South-East England can attract new industry. The hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) says that many of these industries—cement making, gravel, and so on—are declining. By their nature, these have been the types of industry which have blighted the landscape and have made an environmental disgrace of the banks of the River Thames.<br><br>
My indictment of the two county councils concerned is that they have done so little in the past to counter the blight that those industries have created in their areas, which is their responsibility as a planning authority and as an environment authority. This is the county councils' responsibility. I am being kind to the county councils concerned when I say that this has not been a malicious policy adopted by Kent or Essex. It has been the policy of county councillors whose own environment is very different from the environment along the banks of the Thames. Possibly they do not fully appreciate the problem of how blighted the banks of our principal river have become and will continue to be if the two county councils remain in control of this vital area.<br><br>
There are other aspects, such as land reclamation, on which I would criticise them, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South (Mr. Michael Cocks). That is important in this area because much could be done to change the mud-banks into an area suitable for leisure. With vision, imagination and money, county councils could create a major feature of the banks of the Thames instead of its being, as at present, a blight.<br><br>
In the midst of all this is a major holi-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0361">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 655</span>
day resort, Southend. With the development of Foulness airport and the industrial complex which is bound to follow, with the docks, the airport, the industries and so on, Southend will find itself sandwiched between highly industrial development of that nature to its east as well as to its west, and across the banks of the river to the south. Not unnaturally, the council at Southend has considered how best it, as a county borough, as well as its neighbours alongside, can counter the neglect of the features of the river bank, which is essential for its survival as one of the major seaside resorts of this country. The proposals in either of the Amendments, but particularly the softer Amendment No. 441, could considerably help Southend, as well as the other authorities which border the River Thames, to tackle the problem of the river banks.<br><br>
The Minister of State mentioned a valley near Sheffield when my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Swain) was speaking so forcefully about his Amendment. Very properly, the Minister of State said that he would concede the Amendments but that the sides of the valley were an absolute disgrace and if they were to be put under the one authority they must be cleaned up. Our arguments concern not just a valley near Sheffield; they concern the river banks of the principal river leading to the capital of this country and what it will be possible to do if a Thamesside authority were created. Under the terms of the Amendments there would be created a metropolitan county council that would have not only the power but the will to clear up this river valley situated between the two authorities, which has become such a blighted mess because of past neglect.<br><br>
The Secretary of State is the Secretary of State not only for Local Government, but also for the Environment. The environmental problem is the leading argument for the creation of a linear metropolitan county on the two sides of the river at this point. The river itself, under the proposals of the right hon. Gentleman, will probably be the responsibility of a river and tourist authority. I would applaud the Government for creating these authorities that are concerned with the water in the rivers and, when the times comes, I shall support
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 656</span>
them on these proposals. But those water and drainage authorities do not control the banks of the river. We are concerned now not only about the water of the river but the very banks of the river. They are the things which are in a mess and which the creation of such an authority could certainly clean up.<br><br>
5.0 p.m.<br><br>
My hon. Friend used a wonderful phrase, one that I had not heard before. He called this area the golden coffin. I should say that that is precisely what it will become unless something is done about the environment. This kind of Amendment comes into being with a strong authority to prevent it becoming a coffin. Golden it might be, with rich industry creating wealth, pouring out waste, but the whole area, though it be golden, becomes a dead coffin of an area so far as planning, development, and local authorities are concerned.<br><br>
Mention has been made of the links across the river. There is the link at Dartford. There are very strongly mooted proposals for a second connecting link, and, as the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) says, he would very strongly welcome such a second link which will be all the more important when Foulness Airport and the Foulness complex comes into being: otherwise the Kent bank of the river will become a backwater unless there is a second major link across the Estuary—I would doubt a bridge, but probably a tunnel.<br><br>
Let us look at the population patterns in the area at the present time. I would say that the population patterns of the Essex bank are directly with London. They are east/west, not north/south. The population patterns of these towns on the north bank of the Thames do not go up into Colchester and into Essex; they go eastwards into these areas and westwards into the Greater London area. Likewise on the south bank of the river, the main travel pattern is certainly not south down into Canterbury or the heartland of Kent; it is west into London and east out of London into the authorities where people are increasingly moving out of the Greater London Council to live.<br><br>
I would say to these authorities, though they send very short, terse and sharp replies to Southend on this matter, that if I were living here and if I were a local
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0362">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 657</span>
authority so near to the Greater London Council, I should very much want a large metropolitan area in this region, to preserve the independence of this region over its own resources and not allow it to be eroded piece by piece by London moving out. I should be very attracted indeed on that account to the proposals for a linear metropolitan area on each side of the bank of the river.<br><br>
I accept fully the point made by my hon. Friend that these are very viable authorities—viable as to population and as to rateable value, viable in that they are industrial areas similar to so many other metropolitan councils. What has not been discussed in any detail in Committee—and, no doubt, the Minister in his reply will use this argument—is the effect of the creation of a new Thameside metropolitan area on the county councils concerned in Kent and Essex.<br><br>
I should say that proposals made by the hon. Gentleman, and with which I think all hon. Members in the Committee have been circulated from Southend—the case for a Thameside metropolitan county—deal without any reservation with how this will affect both Essex and Kent. With the creation of this authority, under Amendment No. 426—the position would be improved even more under the Amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper)—Essex would have a population, even excluding the controversial parts of the north-east of Essex, of 736,854, and Kent a population of 868,997 on present figures. This is a growth area and a rapid growth area, so that the likely population figures, both of Essex and of Kent, would, in a very short space of time, be considerably greater than that even if the Thameside authority were created.<br><br>
That being so, these are very viable authorities when one looks at other non-metropolitan counties in the country. They would be authorities where the population would grow rapidly, not fixed or declining. In some non-metropolitan counties there is a risk of a slight decline in population. That certainly would not happen as far as Kent and Essex are concerned. Whatever the merits or demerits of the arguments which we shall have at a later stage about North-East Essex, I, like many other hon. Members of the Committee, are somewhat confused, and have not fully made up our
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 658</span>
minds whether this area should go into Suffolk or whether it should remain in Essex. There is always the possibility that the Committee will decide that North-East Essex shall remain in Essex and not go into Suffolk. If that were the position, the Essex county area would increase in population. The figures I have given do not take into account the possibility of North-East Essex coming with the rest of Essex.<br><br>
There is great merit in the proposal for a linear metropolitan authority along the banks of the principal river of this country, in conditions which are on all fours with the conditions that one finds in other major river areas which are major ports. Nothing but good could come from the creation of such an authority. The Government should consider not just the position at present, much less the position in the past. They should be considering the pattern of local government in a major developing area over the next 25 or 50 years. If the Government can do that, they might see considerably greater merit, strength, reason and idealism in the proposals put forward in these Amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Trew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have the honour to represent three local authorities which are affected by these proposals. All three are affected wholly by Amendment No. 426. Dartford Rural District Council is affected partly by Amendment No. 441. The position of these councils at present is that Swanscombe Urban District Council has come out against, while Dartford Borough Council and Dartford Rural District Council have not yet decided. While I would not cite that as evidence that they are opposed to the proposal, it cannot be taken as evidence that they are enthusiastic about it.<br><br>
Certain criteria have been laid down for the constitution of metropolitan counties, and it is worth checking this proposal against them. Paragraph 31 of the White Paper states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The metropolitan pattern is suitable only where a county is divisible into districts all of which are populous and compact."</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend the Minister of State during the Second Reading debate on 16th November actually mentioned a figure of 250,000 as a minimum population for a metropolitan district. If one looks at the districts proposed in these Amendments against these criteria of populousness and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0363">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 659</span>
compactness, I should like to inform the Committee what the populations are. I am referring to Amendment No. 426 which deals with the bigger populations, and the figures are based on the April, 1971, census. District (<i>a</i>) has a population of 183,000. This is on the 1971 census. District (<i>b</i>) has 230,000; District (<i>c</i>) has 204,000; District (<i>d</i>) 242,000; and District (<i>e</i>) 300,000. In only one case, namely District (<i>e</i>), is the population in excess of 250,000. That district includes the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate). My hon. Friend has reminded us on more than one occasion that this is one of the principal apple growing areas of Britain.<br><br>
There is no reason why a metropolitan district should not be one of the principal apple-growing areas of Britain, but it is hardly consistent with the criterion of compactness. If we answer that objection by the point made by the right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) and take District (<i>c</i>) in Amendment No. 441, it then falls below the criterion for population, because it will then have a population of only 199,000.<br><br>
The total population of the proposed metropolitan county—1,159,000—is lower than that of any other metropolitan county proposed in the Bill. It is lower in total population, and in terms of density of population. That would not be an objection were it not for the fact that the proposed metropolitan county spans the Thames. That is a considerable objection in itself—and to outweigh that objection there would have been overriding considerations of very high population or great compactness or density.<br><br>
On those criteria there is no justification for a Thameside metropolitan county, or for constituting any of the areas proposed as metropolitan districts.<br><br>
I want to refer to some of the arguments for this proposed metropolitan county. They were put forward very plausibly and eloquently by both the hon. Member for Flint, East (Mr. Barry Jones) and the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes). I am very grateful to them for the way in which they have aired the problems of the area that I represent and those represented by the hon. Member for Faversham and others. We have acute problems of industrial development and environment, and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 660</span>
a short-term problem in the Thames flood barrier.<br><br>
On the industrial side we are starved of development, because areas such as Wales and Merseyside get priority. It is very gratifying to find hon. Members from those parts of the world speaking up for us.<br><br>
The arguments about industrial spoliation and the deterioration of the environment are perhaps the most cogent arguments in favour of a single planning authority. I put it to the hon. Member for Widnes that the present dereliction in that area—with the proliferation of gravel and chalk pits—does not really stem from the neglect of Kent County Council as much as from the inadequacy of the planning machinery on which the original consents were granted and the immense difficulty of enforcement. Inevitably, as a Member for that part of the world—I have many cases of people complaining about the quality of the environment. One finds that in many instances the local authority is simply unable to enforce many of the original planning conditions.<br><br>
To a certain extent the solution to that problem lies in the reform of planning machinery, but in one sense North-West Kent—and I suspect that the same is true of Essex—has come to the end of a phase in its development. A great deal of the mineral workings have now been exploited. My hon. Friend the Member for Faversham has referred to the run-down of some of the traditional industries in the area, notably cement, paper-making and heavy engineering. This area has to make a fresh start.<br><br>
I do not necessarily accept the argument put forward by hon. Members opposite that the challenge will be met simply by creating a new Thameside authority. The problem poses an enormous challenge both to Kent County Council and Essex County Council. I am certain that they are very conscious of the challenge. I am also certain that they are conscious of the fact that they are to some extent on trial, and that at some time in the future—if, as I hope and believe, this Amendment is defeated—this proposal will be raised again. Its reception then will inevitably depend on what sort of performance the Essex and Kent County Councils have achieved in the intervening years.<br><br>

5.15 p.m.<br><br>
I should like to say something about the Thames flood barrier and the downstream flood defences because it is a problem in which I have taken considerable personal interest. There is the problem of co-ordination, and of getting the flood defences adequately built. The problem does not stem from the number of local authorities involved; it arises because of the involvement of two Government Departments—the Ministry of Agriculture and the Department of the Environment—and four drainage authorities, coupled with a large number of privately-owned frontages.<br><br>
In the 20 miles downstream of the barrier there are about 1,000 privately-owned frontages, and the river authorities, not the local authorities, will be collaborating with those private frontagers with a view to the building of the defences. The creation of a Thameside metropolitan county will not make any contribution to the problem. Presumably there would have to be a new river authority, to be called the Thameside River Authority, responsible for the truncated rivers flowing into the Thames, and perhaps for that section of the Thames itself. That does not strike me as a tidy arrangement, or one that would make a big contribution to solving the problem.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Flint, East and the hon. Member for Widnes stressed what might happen in the future. It is prudent planning to take into account possible future development, and Foulness and the Channel Tunnel could have a profound effect. I need not stress that it is not impossible that the Channel Tunnel will not be built. It is not even impossible that Foulness Airport will not be built, although I sincerely hope that both it and the tunnel are. It is rash to design new local authority areas in the expectations of developments of that magnitude being built. Far better to let them be built and to see what problems they generate. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham, who says that it is important to treat Essex as a whole in considering the possible effects of Foulness.<br><br>
As I said earlier, at some time in the future the subject might be raised again. We can then consider it on its merits. For the present the proposal is premature,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 662</span>
and I hope that the Committee will reject it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I approach the Amendments with an open mind. I have not been convinced by the arguments put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Flint, East (Mr. Barry Jones) and my hon. Friend the Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes), to create a new authority of Thameside. Where are the links between North Kent and South Essex? I am aware of the Dartford Tunnel, and I know that many people commute from North Kent to Essex, but that is not a sufficient basis for a new local authority or metropolitan area.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Widnes admitted that there are greater links between North Kent, South Essex, and London than between the two areas themselves. The hon. Member suggested that there might be a place for two metropolitan areas, although both would be far too small, and he developed the argument of the linear links from east to west rather than north to south. He referred to the absence of north-south links between the parts of Essex with which we are concerned and Chelmsford and Colchester. I agree with him.<br><br>
My hon. Friend also referred to the absence of links between North Kent and South Kent. Again, I agree. However, the links between South Kent and North Essex are none too great. The links with London are much greater. Pursuing that argument, one is led to suggest that these two areas should be connected with Greater London rather than across the river as a metropolitan area.<br><br>
If the principle of the number of commuters were to be applied to other parts of the country there would be greater metropolitan areas in Merseyside, Manchester and the West Midlands. One must accept that people may be living in one local authority area and working in another.<br><br>
Much play has been made of the unity of interest formed by the River Thames. That argument can be pressed too far. Reference has already been made to the Channel which separates France and this country. Most hon. Members present would agree that if we enter the Common Market we would not accept a local authority area including both Dover and Calais. Nor would we say that the Atlantic Ocean united New York with Bristol.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0365">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 663</span>
Nor, indeed, would those of my hon. Friends who represent Bristol and South Wales constituencies accept that the River Severn required a local authority to cover both banks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a matter of degree. Hon. Members who make this proposal are not suggesting that Margate and Harwich should be linked. The question arises of the width of the river concerned. Obviously one reaches the point of no return.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I draw his attention to the ultimate effect of the Amendments. It is true that they would unite South Essex with North Kent. However, Amendment No. 426 would separate both banks of the River Crouch, and Amendment No. 441 would separate both banks of the Swayle. In both instances we are discussing rivers smaller than the Thames. If my hon. Friend argues that there is a community of interest between the north and south banks of the River Thames I am hard put to it to understand why there is disunity of interest between the two banks of the Swayle and the Crouch.<br><br>
Having listened to the arguments, I believe that the case is not one of saying that the north and south banks of the River Thames have a community of interests; the real motive is one of local authority power. I do not disagree with that motive. I have a great deal of sympathy with local authorities both round the Medway and in Southend. They are trying to see what arrangements may be made, within the restrictions of the Government's proposals, to give themselves the maximum power.<br><br>
Since the Government are determined upon two-tier local government, those local authorities who advocate a Thameside authority do so in order that they may be metropolitan district councils, with the maximum possible responsibility. I repeat; I have a great deal of sympathy with them. The fact remains that they are trying to make the best of a bad job.<br><br>
Thus, I believe that the arguments for a metropolitan area covering North Kent and South Essex in order that the local councils may have greater authority mean that the Government proposals are wrong. I am opposed to those proposals. The case of Southend and the Medway towns argues strongly in favour of separate
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 664</span>
authorities, which many of my hon. Friends have advocated on a number of occasions.<br><br>
I entirely accept that both South Essex and North Kent have severe industrial problems—a point which hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have touched upon. However, I cannot accept that the existence of those problems means the establishment of a Thameside metropolitan area. There is a very good argument for regional or provincial government—an argument that has been strongly made by my hon. Friends. However, the fact that the Government are adamant in refusing regional or provincial government does not mean that we should make a botched job of the county councils, which, in my opinion, these Amendments would do.<br><br>
I do not share the optimism of the hon. Member for Dartford (Mr. Trew) or the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate), who seem to think that the county councils of Essex or Kent will cope with these problems. I am convinced of the need for provincial government in order to deal with problems on this scale. Nevertheless, we should not make matters worse by concocting a metropolitan area, about which I am personally not convinced after listening to the arguments put forward this evening.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee might well be proud of the level of debate this afternoon on the question of the Thameside Amendments. The arguments have been cogently put by hon. Members on both sides. Speaking as someone who has still not entirely made up his mind, I found that I tended to agree with so many of the points that were made that it was obvious that some effort of will would have to be exercised at the end of the day in order to reach a decision.<br><br>
I thought that the balance of argument lay with those who were in favour of a metropolitan county—but only just, because quite strong arguments were put forward that need to be met.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Widnes (Mr. Gordon Oakes) dealt summarily but effectively with this and I should like to hear the Minister's view on it. One point which worried me was the extent to which the rumps of the counties of Essex and Kent, whether Essex goes in with Suffolk or not, would be viable entities. We have been given the popula-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0366">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 665</span>
tion figures—736,000 for Essex, and 868,000 for Kent. This does not seem to be a large matter to deal with, but I think the point must be considered, and the Minister's view on whether this is viable will be of some importance.<br><br>
Of the two Amendments in the names of my hon. Friends I preferred Amendment No. 441 when I read it and when it was argued, because such knowledge as I have—and I have a certain amount of personal knowledge, as one is bound to have if one represents a constituency in South-East London—makes me think that the areas excluded by Amendment No.441 are rightly excluded and form part of a much more rural county. With that I agree, and I agree about Faversham, too. The hon. Member for Dartford was fair and dispassionate when he said: "We may consider this at some time in the future. I am shutting my eyes to it now, but not necessarily for all time." His was a very fair approach to the question.<br><br>
It is possible to get a figure for District (<i>e</i>) between 199,000 and 300,000 merely by adding population from one Amendment to the other, so that there is nothing sacrosanct about it. If the Minister decided that the whole idea in general were right, I cannot believe that the drop in population to 199,000 in District (<i>e</i>) under Amendment No. 441 would deter him. There might be other things that might deter him, but not, I suggest, that.<br><br>
On the question of the populations of the various proposed metropolitan districts, they do not totally horrify me. The figure of 183,000 is the lowest. But is there not a metropolitan district council of 143,000 in West Yorkshire? I may be wrong, but I had that figure at the back of my mind. As to the others, they may not be quite 250,000, but they are near enough—and, anyway, the population is going up every year. I do not know the figure by which the population of Basildon, for example, is increasing each year. I think most new towns average an increase in population of 5,000 or 6,000 a year. So that we are not talking about a distant future.<br><br>
5.30 p.m.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Widnes made a very important point. He differentiated between what might happen at a long future date—and I was taken to task when I made the point about a long future date when we considered whether Humberside should be a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 666</span>
metropolitan county—and the immediate future. Within the next five years the population of that area will grow enormously. All the strategic studies seem to show that.<br><br>
I promised myself that I would not talk about frivolous and irrelevant nonsenses during the discussion on this Amendment or indeed any other. I shall therefore not talk about the Common Market. However, I can perhaps mention the Channel bridge. I was present when my hon. Friend heard someone describe the Channel bridge or Channel tunnel as not a reality but a dream. He did not quite complete the quotation, which was that, on the other hand, Foulness was not a dream but a reality.<br><br>
I do not agree with the hon. Member for Dartford about Foulness. I do not think that anything will stop it now. For good or evil, it is quite clearly coming and it is in the making, which is more than can be said about the Channel tunnel, so we have to take it into account. In taking it into account, I should like to read something which I think is relevant—an article by Professor Buchanan published in the <i>Sunday Times</i> on 2nd May, 1971. It was entitled, "How to make the best of Foulness". As the Committee will remember, Professor Buchanan was the only dissenting member of the Roskill Commission, of blessed memory. It was he who recommended Foulness, so perhaps the Committee will treat him as an expert witness, as it were, by the written word, at any rate. There are two points which I think the Committee ought to hear. They are interesting and germane to this point. He says:
<br><blockquote><p>"In all this I see the River Thames as a vital link—not a transport link but a design link along which a grand regenerative process can be initiated. The Thames downstream of London Bridge could be made into one of the great features of Britain; the conditions, with the changing scene in the Docks and the bold example of Thamesmead and now the airport at Foulness are ripe as they are unlikely to be ripe again for a couple of centuries. I hope the opportunity will not be thrown away."</p></blockquote>
Later, very much to the point, he says:
<br><blockquote><p>"I want the final choice for the new road and rail links, planned integrally with the urban development, to be British technology and design at its best. Indeed I want the whole package from Foulness to King's Cross including the treatment of the river to become something that will make the foreign visitors gasp and say 'My God, this country can do things after all.' What a country does with its land, its buildings
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0367">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 667</span>
and its works is in my view a good indication of its standard of culture."</p></blockquote>
Having quoted that, I shall not say that what Professor Buchanan had in mind was Amendment No. 441. It is only fair to point out that what he was thinking of in his "grand regenerative process" was—and I think he used the words—a kind of British equivalent in the Thameside area of the American Tennessee Valley Authority. But what he is also saying is that local government planning shall work at the same time as this and work in harmony with it. Therefore, what is the best local authority set-up which we can envisage to assist—and I think hon. Members on both sides of the Committee agree with me on this—this dream, or, let us hope, this reality, of Professor Buchanan?<br><br>
I was, to a great extent, convinced—not 100 per cent., but greatly convinced—by the arguments which were adduced by my hon. Friend the Member for Flint, East (Mr. Barry Jones). I did my little summary of communities, as I usually do when I consider these things, to see how far we came to meet the point he was making. He certainly convinced me that there was a community of interest, a community of work.<br><br>
I do not know that it matters very much, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove (Mr. Terry Davis) said, whether people in Essex commute to Kent or people in Kent commute to Essex. Of course they do both. Incidentally, it is not just in the dockland area, but through the Dartford Tunnel. One can see it every day. With one reservation which I shall come to, I would agree that they commute to London, to the "great wen". They have this community of interest, that they are all within the greatest commuter belt in the country. They work in very much the same sort of conditions, in the same sort of areas, and in the same sort of industries on both sides of the Thames, whether north in Tilbury, in Essex, or south in Gravesend, in Kent. There is a great deal of contact between the two groups.<br><br>
If one went right to the mouth of the river, one would also see the similarity in the community of interest between the largest and proudest holiday resort in southern England and the lesser, but quite grand resorts, south of the Thames on the other bank. The relevance of the resorts is that they are the playground of people living on both sides of the river.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 668</span>
Work and play come into it.<br><br>
We have talked about the estuarial concept, and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Widnes said, we agree with the Secretary of State's important point that rivers should be unifying rather than divisive factors. My hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove had a lot of fun with us when he talked about the River Crouch and the River Thames, but if there is in a great waterway known all over the world—and, with great respect to anyone interested in the Crouch, it is not known all over the world whereas the Thames is—a community of interest in such an estuary I think it deserves to be treated a little more seriously.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) rightly talked about the lack of community interest between the two banks of the Thames at their furthest point. He then went on to say—and I made very careful note of it at the time because, as with so many things he says, I found myself in some agreement with him—that if one were talking about Gravesend and Tilbury that would be a different matter. I am talking about Gravesend and Tilbury, and that.was one of the things I found myself most impressed with.<br><br>
It can be said that there will be lack of community interest of some sort, and one that might be mentioned is education. If we were to turn this into a metropolitan county there would be five separate systems of education, whereas now there will only be two. Only two, Sir Stephen? If one looks at Kent today there would seem to be about four different systems of education, and they range from comprehensive to selective at 11-plus, with no particular logic to them and no particular rhythm. I do not think that that is a very important point.<br><br>
As the Minister knows, I have always felt that in metropolitan counties education should lie with the metropolitan county itself rather than with the metropolitan district, but no doubt we shall continue to discuss this at length and without prejudice to that view, if there is no disadvantage in education being treated in the way I have suggested. If the Minister feels that education should rest with the metropolitan district council, I do not think the population figures from his point of view are too small from various districts to support him.<br><br>
Community of population is the next thing, and here again my hon. Friend the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0368">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 669</span>
Member for Flint, East made a very convincing case. There is this contiguity, this linear development. I rather like that phrase. The adjective, in this connection, I have never heard before, but I am a great collector of jargon and I hope one day to publish a dictionary of it. This particular piece of jargon, however, if one knows the areas, does have some sense to it. Merely to say that a city is a line, as it were, does not seem to me to have very much point in it. But if one means that a linear development of this sort is a development of contiguous interest, it has a great deal of substance to it. That, I realise, is what this phrase means. The problems that are faced in the area are very much the same. We have mentioned the question of flooding and, while the hon. Member for Dartford suggests that the answer to this might not only lie with a local authority, certainly the planning that must accompany these problems could lie with them and could be more effective.<br><br>
Equally, since one is talking about planning, the question of the environment is bound to arise. There are all sorts of reasons why that particular part of our country is not as beautiful as it should be. It is a sad thought that it is not beautiful. To many people this is—and, of course, it will increasingly be so as Foulness develops—the first view they will have of our country. We are all resolved to clean it up. But would it not be better if there were a single planning authority capable of dealing with the situation, rather than two opposed counties which, with the best will in the world, as far as I know, have never worked together, and which, I would have thought, would not be inclined necessarily to work so well together in the future? If there is a shotgun marriage of a metropolitan county, the authorities are forced to work together, and that at least is something.<br><br>
I mentioned that this was very much a commuter-belt area. There is no greater one in the country. However, I do not wholly agree with the point of view expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Widnes that there was no real link between, let us say, North Kent and South Kent, because there are the beginnings at least of two motorways. They go quite a long way. The
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 670</span>
A2 is really rather better than the M2 in some cases because it has got three lanes against the M2's two lanes. But, at any rate, there is a continuous flow out of London there, and it is moving in the right direction; and so, of course, is the A20 or M20 which seems to be improving greatly the whole time.<br><br>
5.45 p.m.<br><br>
But having said that, the nearer distance is across the river, and here I do agree with my hon. Friend. There is no question, I think, that, there will be another leg to the Dartford Tunnel. It is screaming out for it now. I think all of us are very pleased that the Dartford Tunnel does exist, but does not detract in any way from the desirability of further communication between the two banks of the river. Indeed, the hon. Member for Faversham made a very eloquent plea for a bridge which he thought was feasible, and which I would have thought was feasible, and once one has got that, one has to a great extent the Humberside situation with the difference that this is much more industrially developed on both sides of the river than is the case in Humberside. Having looked at the situation in that light, the case becomes rather stronger.<br><br>
The point that attracts me to the metropolitan county idea is the fear of what the alternative will be. It may be that that is why the hon. Members for Faversham and Dartford and my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove, and perhaps the Minister, may lake the other point of view. Perhaps they, too, fear an alternative. But the alternative here is very real and demonstrable, and it is this. In my lifetime I have seen this great City of London, where my constituency is and where I grew up, growing and growing. I will not say that I saw it originally as the City of London, one mile square; but that is its history and from that it grew to the London I knew, the old L.C.C. area, later to become, the Inner London area, then a Greater London taking in areas that nobody thought of building on. Despite my grey hairs I am not as old as a that.<br><br>
When I was a boy I used to go with my parents along the Sidcup road; places were not built up and nobody thought of building them up. I have seen all this
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0369">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 671</span>
grow, and a new Greater London created. I genuinely fear not a metropolis but a megalopolis. It is an ugly word for an ugly thought, for a London stretching right down to the Channel ports along the whole of the Thames estuary. It is a real possibility. Quite apart from its lack of aesthetic and social content, we could perhaps view the prospect of the right hon. Gentleman the Prime Minister not only fleeing Bexley, but also Thanet, as the whole of this megalopolis enveloped him all the way along the Thames. That would be a very sorry situation. But it is a genuine likelihood that if we are not careful, London will expand right along the Thames estuary. It has moved very much that way during my lifetime. If we are talking about a period of 30 years, as some hon. Members have, it is a real prospect and one that we should try to avoid.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South (Mr. Michael Cocks) talked about having a counterbalance for London. That is an important consideration to bear in mind at this moment—that the strong economic, social, administrative area might be just such a counterbalance to a devouring, expanding London, a London not necessarily of malice aforethought but by absence of mind, but a London that is nevertheless expanding in that way.<br><br>
I find the argument in favour of such a metropolitan county of Thameside attractive, but I see disadvantages. This is a case where no one can talk about a political bias one way or the other, because there are strange political bedfellows in either camp, those who are in favour and those who are against. No one can see any possible political advantage either way. So the judgment to be made is the sort of judgment that this Committee ought to make. Whichever way we decide, I suppose that we will have decided the future of the Thames estuary for the next 30 years or so. Therefore, it had better be the right decision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Development (Mr. Graham Page)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I say, first, that Megalopolis is a village in Pelopannesus and, although I am ambitious about this local government reform Bill, I do not really want to stretch that far.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 672</span>
I said that I am ambitious. Indeed, this Amendment has some very ambitious ideas in it. Whether it is right in its conception of how these ideas and ambitions may be realised is for us to consider now. There is undoubtedly a feeling of puzzlement, a feeling of searching for the right answer, when one looks at the tremendous developments that are to take place in this area, both north and south of Thames. There are the great developments from London to Foulness, which will transform South Essex. There are probably great developments from the Channel Tunnel in the Kent area.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Dartford (Mr. Trew) said that there is a feeling on both sides of the Thames that we are starting on a new era. I think he said we are ending an era. I would rather say that we are starting on a new era, certainly in work and in the residential pattern, and in the pattern of travel. We cannot close our eyes to the fact that the Thameside area, perhaps more than any other part of the South-East will be affected by our connections with Europe in the future.<br><br>
I do not think the right hon. Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin) was wrong when he used the phrase "the grand design for this area". He quoted some ideas from Sir Colin Buchanan. What we have to consider is whether these two Amendments are the right way to carry out this grand design. The right hon. Member for Deptford made some constraining remarks about London. But can one possibly think of the grand design which he had in mind without bringing London into it in some form? When one looks at the local authority here suggested for carrying out this grand design, with all respect to the urban districts and rural districts which are included, the only major local authority within this suggested area is the Southend Borough Council. I wonder whether this is really the right thing if one is being ambitious about the Thameside development. I do not see this Bill fixing the pattern for this for 30 years. I think we shall develop very quickly. It may need very considerable Government assistance, and perhaps special agencies of one sort and another to supplement the local authorities in carrying out the grand design for this area.<br><br>
If there is to be a Thameside County,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0370">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 673</span>
as is suggested by these two Amendments, those proposing it will have to prove four factors: first, that South Essex, on the north side of Thameside, should be separated from the rest of Essex; secondly, on the south side, that North Kent should be separated from the rest of Kent. Having separated those two areas from their respective counties, the third factor is: should they be combined together as one county? We have had proposals all through the consultations on this reform of two different counties, one on the north side and one on the south side. If they are to be combined, the fourth factor is: is it to be in the form of a metropolitan county?<br><br>
It would be impossible to conceive an idea of carving out areas from these two counties—Essex and Kent—without creating a metropolitan county. This would fit in with our ideas about the metropolitan county being fairly tight around the built up area, and an ordinary county the principal combination of urban and rural. Having cut out the urban part of Essex and Kent we would have to make it an urban county. If that is so, one then has to look at the sort of districts that could be produced by that county. By Amendment No. 426, for out of the five possible districts would be below the criteria which we have set of a population of a quarter of a million for a metropolitan district. I appreciate that in a few cases we have fallen below that figure from time to time. In fact, the smallest—if I may correct the right hon. Member for Deptford—is South Shields with 177,000.<br><br>
In the case of this proposed metropolitan county, four of the districts would have to be, with any reason, below the 250,000 mark, and in Amendment No. 441, all of them would have to be below that figure. So we would be creating a metropolitan county with under-sized districts. In one instance the metropoltan county would be 1,159,000 and in the other 1,022,000.<br><br>
Again I come back to this point. If we are going to be ambitious and try to set a pattern here and now for the development of Thameside this does not appear to be the right sort of local authority to manage such a large and ambitious project. I think that we should wait a little time at least to see how the developments proceed. I do no necessarily mean by
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 674</span>
that to throw any doubt on the future of the two counties. It may well be that things will work out on a basis of the two counties on either side of the Thames developing their areas separately and for us, nationally perhaps, to arrange for the combination of work of those two counties. I am faced with the proposition that the majority of authorities of the counties on both sides are opposed to this proposal.<br><br>
6.0 p.m.<br><br>
Of the authorities which would form part of this county, I readily admit that a majority would like to see something other than the two existing counties, and have expressed a preference for some Thameside proposal, not necessarily a Thameside county combining both sides of the Thames but at least a Thameside proposal. When I talk about majorities, I am only taking the vote of the local authority and then taking the population and adding those together. Taking it on that basis, those who wish to stay part of their respective counties in South Essex number 132,000 of the population and in North Kent 96,400, which means that there are some 228,600 against the Thameside proposal, whether it be for two separate Thameside counties or one combined county.<br><br>
Those who are in favour of some form of Thameside proposal number 499,500, and those who are silent, 431,000. There is a searching for something new here; a feeling that we have a major problem on Thameside. Generally speaking, those authorities which seek some form of Thameside county would prefer two Thameside counties, one on the north and the other on the south. I am sure it would not be right to carve out those areas into small counties away from existing counties.<br><br>
On the Essex side there will be a major development with Foulness. On the south side, although there will be the development from the Channel Tunnel and the natural growth of the South-East, there is nothing comparable with the development of Foulness. To some extent, if those two are combined there will be an imbalance between the Essex and Kent sides.<br><br>
It has been pointed out that at present there is little communication between the two sides of the Thames—certainly nothing below stream of Dartford Tunnel, although my hon. Friend the Member for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0371">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 675</span>
Dartford (Mr. Trew) said he envisaged a link between Sheppey and Southend.<br><br>
We would do violence to both existing counties if we cut off South Essex and North Kent and either joined them in one county or made them into separate counties. The right hon. Member for Deptford, and even more forcefully, the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes), referred to the estuarial development which has been recognised in other parts of the country.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Widnes, in an intervention, put his finger on a weakness of his own case when he said it was a matter of degree. It is indeed. The question of degree is a matter of judgment and in this present case the advantages of estuarial development are not so evident in Thameside as in other areas. We need a grander design than talking about cleaning up the Estuary. We shall, I hope, have effective river authorities to do that. I hope also that a lot will be done to look after the environment aspect of the estuary.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Deptford referred to the community of interest—that is, the same sort of work on both sides of the Thames. In regard to the movement for work it is significant that there is linear development, and linear development of transport along both sides of the Thames rather than a joining up of the two sides. Although there is linear development along and parallel with the Thames on both sides I disagreed with the comment that road and rail communications do not go into the counties on either side. There is certainly travel into Essex and into Kent from both South Essex and North Kent.<br><br>
In summing up the pros and cons of an ambitious idea, I can only say that it does not meet the problems which will face us over the next few years. There are two effective counties in Essex and Kent: it would be better to leave them to work out their destinies, at least for a period of time, and to see how the development of Foulness and the development in the South-Eeast towards the Channel Tunnel and Europe work out. One cannot forever put out some new form of local authority, such as is suggested in the Amendments. It may well be the solution, although I can see no real solutions to the larger problems involved in the Amendments.<br><br>
I ask the Committee to let the two
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 676</span>
counties, Essex and Kent, work on their development for the present, and we shall see how the new developments of Foulness, the South-East and Kent work out for the future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before calling the next speaker it may be convenient if I point out that I propose to suspend at 6.45 and to resume at 8.15.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ray Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not originally intend to say anything, but having listened to the debate, and to the Minister's interjection, I feel bound to comment. I must confess that during the Christmas recess I completely forgot about the Local Government Committee, particularly around the 25th and 26th of last month. In my most conscious moments, had I dipped and moved into the deepest recesses of my mind, I would not have come up with my membership of the Committee. That was not solely due to our being in the midst of a festive season. Since I have been a member of the Committee, I have not thought that we have been discussing the right things. I accept that the Minister is an honourable man, and that it is an honourable Government, but considering the tremendous problems of government at national and local level, the Minister and the Government are not facing up to all the issues involved.<br><br>
The Amendment relating to Thameside offers a second best, although it is an improvement on the Government scheme. I would rather have seen all the arguments and the propositions that have been put forward from this side encompassed within the framework of regionalism, which would be the right, sensible and timely way to approach the problem. We could have looked at the Thames and its problems, the problem of the third London airport and the question of the Channel Tunnel in one if we were to consider the concept of regionalism. Unfortunately, we are not doing that, and hon. Members on this side have been channelled into thinking as do the Government, because it is said that what the Government have proposed is the only practical way to get some sensible aproach into the new concept of local government.<br><br>
I take up the point raised by the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes), that in dealing with the Bill and local govern-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0372">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 677</span>
ment we are not considering the past or the present, but the future. Thinking about the future, and all the problems to be faced, the proposal for Thameside caters more adequately for the future problems of that region than to the Government's proposals. I shall develop the matters flowing from that later.<br><br>
One point raised by the hon. Member for Widnes, which was also raised by the hon. Member for Flint, East (Mr. Barry Jones) this morning, and challenged by the hon. Member for Bromsgrove (Mr. Terry Davis), was the question of links. The hon. Members said that we should have at the centre of our arguments in favour of this region or this authority or that authority, the proposition that links and community of interest should dominate all other considerations. I do not think so, for the reason that we, are talking about the future and future needs. There is no doubt that future needs will override many of the present considerations of community interest, and this is certainly the case with Thameside.<br><br>
In any event, I feel at times that in the Committee—although there is every reason for this to be said—that links tend to be a euphemistic argument which is really an attempt to remove any discussion of political considerations. Frankly, I believe, and I shall argue this later when we come to Birmingham and the West Midlands, that there is a strong argument in local government, particularly at a time when we are considering fresh proposals, for putting behind us as much as possible all questions of politics. That may sound high minded. I am aware of the fact that hon. Members of necessity have to bear in mind political considerations, because they are at the centre of all our dealings in the House of Commons.<br><br>
Thameside is a concept. The arguments, put forward adequately, deal with the future, and in particular it ought to be stressed that whilst local government is established to deal with needs, it ought to be flexible enough, wide enough, big enough, to deal with changing needs. There is no doubt that we live in an age of considerable change. Ten years ago, had we been considering local government, an entirely different set of arguments would have been put forward to support a whole range of proposals for change. Ten years ago, very few people talked about the environment, but in 1972 we are intensely concerned with the environment in which
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 678</span>
we live, work and play—so much so that this Government has re-named one of its super-Ministries the Department of the Environment.<br><br>
In this range of environmental difficulties and problems that we face, nothing is more pressing than the need to create greater facilities for leisure. There can be no doubt in anybody's mind that on an estuary like that of the Thames leisure needs would be infinitely better served by one authority than by two. The Minister did not touch on that point, but there is no doubt that with the growth of sailing, underwater swimming and other sports and pastimes of that kind, there will be an enormous rate of growth, and facilities will have to be provided by public bodies. They could be provided in a more efficient way if they were provided by one authority.<br><br>
6.15 p.m.<br><br>
I should also like to deal briefly with the question—it was, I thought, adequately covered by the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes)—of the river as an area of the countryside that has in the past been despoiled, an area which was previously, no doubt, one of great beauty and which we should wish to see restored. Surely it cannot but be argued—the Minister did not deal with this point—that one authority covering both banks of a river like the Thames would be in a far better position to deal with environmental considerations than two? After all, however high-minded two authorities on either side of the bank might be, there would be occasions upon which they would differ. Political control might be exercised on one side which was not repeated on the other. There may be differences of philosophy. It may be that one authority would demand a far higher standard of pollution control than the other. What purpose would be served if one authority were to maintain excellent standards while the other maintained only minimum standards?<br><br>
The question of Foulness has also been raised. While not strictly germane to the argument which I am now adducing, I ought to say that I do not agree with the siting of the airport at Foulness. In an age when there is a desperate shortage of land, particularly in Britain, it seems highly irresponsible to use land for the siting of an airport. Indeed, I wrote to the Secretary of State for the Environment, suggesting that a feasibility study be carried out in the County of Kent in order to examine
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0373">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 679</span>
the possibility of siting a third London Airport on a area to be constructed off-shore at Dover.<br><br>
That might appear to be a far-fetched idea. However, I know that civil engineering is advanced enough, and we certainly have sufficient resources, to be able to site an airport at sea. This was done in the Second World War, admittedly on a much smaller scale. I would prefer that the sea should be utilised for a facility of this kind than that an area such as Foulness, which represents land that might have been used for purposes other than—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member must appreciate that we cannot on this Amendment debate the siting of the third London Airport.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept your ruling, Sir Stephen. Nevertheless, I shall revert to Foulness, not as the spot at which the third Airport will be sited, but as a piece of land which I imagine is much below its possible use value, but which could be reclaimed. This, again, represents an argument in favour of a unitary authority covering this area.<br><br>
We are desperately short of land. There will be increasing pressure in the years ahead for a much greater effort to reclaim land than we are at present pursuing as a policy. Indeed, I do not believe that a policy exists in this respect. However, surely one authority charged with the responsibility of reclaiming land—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I see that the hon. Member for Yarmouth (Mr. Fell) shows an interest. He probably feels that we might perhaps completely reclaim the Wash.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Anthony Fell</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before proceeding to a discussion of the reclamation of the Wash, I should also point out to the hon. Member that a debate on the reclamation of land equally does not fall within the scope of the Amendment. So may we stick to the Amendment which we are supposed to be discussing?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What I am thinking of is that after we have established an authority called Thameside we should then go on to extend its land and possibly, as a result of that, its income too.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We have first to decide whether we are to set up such an
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 680</span>
authority. We can discuss its affairs and its functions later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My mind is always rushing off into the future, Sir Stephen. In my opinion, it is one of the bounden duties of politicians and certainly of Government not only to tackle the possible all the time, but on occasions to tackle what other people regard as the impossible. I should have thought with regard to the Amendment before us that that would enable us, in a small way admittedly, to tackle problems which many people consider to be impossible but which, in my opinion, given sufficient imagination—which does not seem to be coming from the Government side at present—are possible.<br><br>
The Minister has already indicated that he does not feel that there is sufficient merit in the proposals, but I ask him to bear in mind the points which have been made. If he is still a Minister in the 30 years' time or less that he was talking of, perhaps he will remember what we have said today and perhaps he will be instrumental in bringing forward the kind of proposals which we have outlined.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Cocks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder if I might comment on a few of the points which have been made since I last spoke. First, the Minister's mind in connection with the unifying effect of rivers has been mentioned in relation to Teesside, Humberside and Avon. I really must tell the Committee that Avon is the odd one out. That name arises as a typical wishy-washy weak-kneed compromise, because neither of the two bits of Gloucestershire or Somerset which have been—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sure that it is a very important area, but we are discussing Thameside at the moment. May we stick to that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cocks</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Sir Stephen. The matter had been mentioned and I felt that I owed a duty to people in the area perhaps, as they say, to put it on the record. I was not really satisfied with the comments of the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate). I felt that in this debate he showed a rather backward-looking attitude which was quite at variance with some of his well known views. In fact, he seemed to be dealing within the existing context without allowing his mind to wander. Had he cited as an example of farming in the area the question
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0374">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 681</span>
of cattle ranching or something like that, I should have taken his point much better. It is well known that the production of apples is intensive farming, and to have a unit within a metropolitan area such as this would in no sense be a discrepancy.<br><br>
I was very taken with his point about the lack of authority for planning bodies to enforce covenants and decisions and so on which they have. I hope that the Minister will take note of that and deal with it, certainly in another context. But the suggestion that we should see what problems are generated in the area and then set about trying to deal with them seems to me to be the sort of thinking that we have suffered from in this country for far too long. Developments are on such a large scale now that unless we can anticipate the kind of things which are going to go wrong, by the time we come round to dealing with the problems they are very often absolutely intractable.<br><br>
The identity of interest between the two banks of the Thames was stressed most ably by my right hon. Friend the Member for Deptford (Mr. John Silkin). There is really an arterial current flowing west to east which is in no way devalued by the fact that there are routes striking out into the heart of both Essex and Kent. I do not think that the Minister really shaped up to this when he replied to the points made in the debate. It is true that there is no major authority in this area, as the Minister said, but I do not quite understand the point of this because we are creating new authorities, and surely if there are major responsibilities to be undertaken like this, it is not necessary to have some already existing major body onto which these responsibilities can be grafted.<br><br>
The criteria which the Minister gave and which he wished to have satisfied before he would accept that this case had been made out showed the same sort of stereotyped thinking which led to a lot of the problems which we are now facing. If one thinks simply in terms of Essex and Kent, and does not think about the very great changes that are now taking place, the whole point of this is missed.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Carter) made
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 682</span>
some remarks about the Government, with which I should not wish to associate myself too closely, but with many of his other remarks I found myself in very great sympathy, particularly when he talked about the way in which the words "environment" and "pollution" are now common currency with anybody who thinks seriously about our conditions of life in this country.<br><br>
I ask the Minister to consider whether we need an entirely new concept when thinking about areas like this, with some kind of grander design than simply trying to satisfy all the various interests and pressures to which we are subjected. After all, we have just had a major debate in Parliament where it was said that it is the job of Parliament to lead rather than follow the people, and I think there are other things besides the views of the local authorities concerned which should be considered. I put it to the Minister that there is a possibility here that on a smaller scale one has the same type of situation which existed in the United States before the war, when the Tennessee Valley Authority was created to deal with a very real problem—not only to deal with the problem, but to act as an example for tackling this kind of problem.<br><br>
There is the possibility of a pilot scheme here. The Minister may feel that the time is not yet right for this. He made some vaguely encouraging sounds about having another look at it. Since this is not the first time that he has hinted that there are various problems that we have come up against, upon which the Government will keep an eye, I wonder whether he is prepared to let the Committee into the secrets of his thinking, whether these are vague blanket assurances made to try to give placebos to those who are not terribly happy about certain issues, or whether there is any real idea in the Government's mind that there should be a review of these things which have cropped up in perhaps four, eight or twelve years' time, whether a running check is to be kept on them and whether there will be some kind of running machinery in action so that these problems are under constant review. I feel that if the Minister could give us some encouragement like this, then we should feel far happier about the replies we have had not only from himself, but from other hon. Members opposite.</span></p>

<p>6.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to comment on some of the things said by the Minister of State about the Amendments. In my opinion, he gave some very thorough thought to the problems of this area, and the solutions that might be envisaged in the future or possibly before this Committee.<br><br>
One of the things said by the hon. Gentleman was that this is not a perfect solution. I do not think that any of my hon. Friends would dream that it is a perfect solution. What I think we are trying to do is to indicate a better solution than that these authorities should go under the control of a non-metropolitan county.<br><br>
Some of the things that the hon. Gentleman said surprised even me. I thought that they were very much in favour of the Amendments that my hon. Friends and I have moved—for example, the figures for and against the existing pattern. If I have it right, the right hon. Gentleman indicated that some 228,000 people were for the present situation, some 499,500 were against the present situation, though I will concede at once not necessarily for the sort of solution that my hon. Friends are proposing in these Amendments, and that some 431,000 people do not know or have not expressed an opinion one way or the other.<br><br>
Those figures relate to Amendment No. 426. If the Minister looks at Amendment No. 441, in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper), he will find that most of the 228,000 are not included in Amendment No. 441, but most of the half a million people who are dissatisfied with the present arrangements are included in that Amendment. To that extent I should like to draw a distinction between the two Amendments on that point. The people who are dissatisfied with the present arrangement, albeit that they do not favour the Southend proposals or the proposals in these Amendments, under Amendment No. 441 would form a considerable majority even if one took in the "don't knows" or the non-committed.<br><br>
There is another reason why I should like to commend Amendment No. 441. The Minister is quite right; it is common sense that when one talks about a river
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 684</span>
being a uniting influence it is a matter of degree. If a river becomes too wide it becomes a dividing influence. That is perfectly true. Amendment No. 441 limits the extent along the estuary to which the new metropolitan county would go. It excludes the eastern parts of Kent, including Faversham and other places which are set out in the first Amendment. Therefore, as the river becomes wider, and there is force in the suggestion that it ceases to be a uniting influence, those under Amendment No. 441 are excluded.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Carter) mentioned environment and leisure facilities. This is important having regard to this area. We have concerned ourselves during the course of the debate with the question of industrial development, airport development and dock development—creating a linear industrial belt, as it were, along the side of the river.<br><br>
We are conscious of the fact that this part of the river, particularly Southend, was the playground of London. It is the playground of this area, except that people now are playing further and further away from home. They go further distances. They go to the South Coast. They go to the South-West. They go abroad. They cross the Channel for their holidays. With increasing leisure, I think it is essential that a holiday area should be created much nearer home, so that people do not choke up the motorways travelling long distances to find a beach that everybody else is visiting. This area has the elements of a leisure area. It has water. Water is an essential element of most leisure areas. It has beaches, which are also an essential element. It has space. Furthermore, Southend has know-how. It has the experience of nearly a century and a half of knowing how to cater for leisure. That could be of inestimable advantage within the metropolitan county area of which Southend would be a part.<br><br>
I do not take, in the same way as my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South (Mr. Michael Cocks), to the remarks made by the Minister with regard to thinking again. I heard what the Minister said about-looking into the future. He accepts our arguments that there will be a tremendous growth in population. That invalidates his argument. The fact that he accepts the argument that over a very
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0376">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 685</span>
short period of time there will be a growth in population and a change in the area invalidates, the present day figures. It would be more cogent had the Minister given us the projected, say, 1980 figures, only eight years off. If he had given the projected figures for the area, my hon. Friends' Amendments would look stronger in the light of those figures, even for the 1980s.<br><br>
The Minister went on to say, "Yes, I think that this is the best situation at the present time, but I admit that it is a changing area, and perhaps some time in the future this might well have to be looked at again". This is the Bill in which we should be looking to the future. I think that the Minister, with his characteristic honesty, has looked at the matter and said, "This is a changing area. The people there are not entirely satisfied with the present set-up. There may well have to be a change, perhaps sooner than we expect." He has told the Committee that.<br><br>
What I sincerely hope is that the two county councils, Kent and Essex, do not use that as an excuse, think that this is an area which they might be losing, do nothing with it, and concentrate on other parts of their counties. That would be the worst possible result. If they felt that at some time in the future they might lose these areas, it would be a justifiable excuse for saying, "Things are changing so rapidly. Best leave things alone and do nothing about the environment of this area. A new authority for this area may be created in the future anyway, which will not be our responsibility."<br><br>
I hope that the county councils concerned do not take that view. There is a risk that they might, and, because of that risk, I ask the Minister to indicate whether the matter raised by Amendment No. 441—which meets many of the objections to Amendment No. 426—should be resolved, not today, but when the Bill is considered by the House, and not left for an indefinite future date when an authority may be set up.<br><br>
Obviously, the Minister appreciates that there is dissatisfaction in the area with the present set-up, and he appreciates many of the arguments put forward in the Committee. I want him to say, with particular reference to Amendment No. 441, whether he likes the solution we have proposed. It
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 686</span>
has defects, admittedly, but it has fewer defects than the <i>status quo</i> under the Bill. Perhaps the Minister could say whether he will look at the matter before Report, so that the dissatisfaction in the area itself might be met, this Committee might be satisfied, and many of the local authorities which want something different might be satisfied. There should be something definite and conclusive in the Bill, which is supposed to design local government for the foreseeable future. We must not leave things in the air.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must tell the hon. Gentleman the Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) that I cannot give any assurance of that sort. I do not believe that we can in this Bill look so far into the future and gaze into the crystal ball. What I have said on previous Amendments is that we are setting up the forms of local government. It may be that at this stage certain areas come within one form, the metropolitan county; other areas come within the non-metropolitan county.<br><br>
I draw attention to Clause 49, which empowers the Boundary Commission to keep all local government areas under review. It is able to recommend, so far as metropolitan status is concerned, if any changes are desirable. But it cannot do that until the first review, 10 or 15 years after the Bill receives the Royal Assent, unless the Secretary of State otherwise directs.<br><br>
The Committee ought to have the correct figures for the areas which wished to stay part of their present county, which are included in Amendment 441. Those wishing to stay in Essex were Rayleigh, Benfleet and Brentwood, and the one wishing to stay in Kent was Strood. The two authorities not included in Amendment No. 441 which wanted to stay with their county, Kent, were Swale and Sittingbourne. The result of those figures is that the population figure for those included in Amendment No. 441 is 174,200 wishing to stay with their respective counties. I put that as a factual matter to set the record right.<br><br>
I am sorry that on this occasion I cannot meet the wishes of the hon. Gentleman the Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes). I am sure the whole Committee would wish to congratulate him on the results of the success which he had on the

previous Amendment, in another estuary. If I could on this occasion persuade your town, Sir Stephen, to make him a Freeman of Southend, we should be following the example of Hale. We congratulate the hon. Gentleman on being made a Freeman of Hale.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you very much.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the Minister intervened at that moment. I have some points to put to him, which I shall, perhaps, expand in the more leisurely post-prandial atmosphere which the Committee will soon enjoy, not in the strong hope of making him change his mind but because the points need to be made, and, in some respects, the hon. Gentleman was not as clear as he usually is. Probably, the reason why I found that lack of clarity—this is very interesting—is that those of my hon. Friends who were in favour of one or other of these Amendments shared with me and with the Minister a belief that a solution at some time does take into account all this community along both sides of the river. It was, I thought, quite striking. I think that the only odd men out, oddly enough, were the hon. Gentlemen the Members for Faversham (Mr. Moate) and for Dartford (Mr. Trew). The rest of us, even my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Carter), though he does not like the idea of Foulness and said so very directly and cogently, talked in terms of some sort of regional solution, by which I think he meant that there was sufficient community of interest between all these areas to justify a quasi-regional or, he would say, fully regional policy. I think it was this additional community of interest which the Minister and my hon. Friends and I had.</span></p>

<p>8.15 p.m.</p>
<p><i>On resuming</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before we resume the debate, I wish to give notice that on Thursday I propose to move a Sittings Motion to the effect that the Committee do sit on Thursday afternoon and in future on Tuesdays and Thursdays, morning and afternoon. I understand I have to give notice of that Motion today in order
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 688</span>
that I may move it on Thursday morning.<br><br>
I wish also to move a procedure Motion to have the Welsh part of the Bill taken towards the end of the Committee proceedings. I think that this would be for the convenience of the Committee. It would mean moving Part II and the appropriate Schedule to a period towards the end of our proceedings, so that sufficient time could be allotted to the boundary problems of Wales rather than have them crowded in with English problems. That is not to give way on the principle of having it all in one Bill. It is just that I think it would be more convenient to arrange it that way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Thomas</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister intend that all the Welsh part shall be taken together as from the date he has in mind?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman puts me in a little difficulty by saying "all the Welsh part", because all the Clauses, throughout the Bill, affect Wales. But there may be certain items relating only to Wales which come up. I have in mind Part II, and, particularly, the boundaries and geography of Wales, which will be discussed at that stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I fully understand the Minister's point. It is a long Bill. For some time, I have felt that three Sittings a week were not sufficient. Therefore, what the Minister proposes is right and reasonable. I am sure that my hon. Friends will not object. They, too, are anxious that the Bill should receive proper consideration. I am pleased about the notice regarding the Welsh provisions, especially as my right hon. Friend the Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Goronwy Roberts) has a form of Welsh—or Asiatic—influenza, more powerful than the normal kind—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thomas</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, English.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are in danger of getting disorderly. All the Minister has done has been to give notice of his intention to move a Motion next Thursday.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before we broke for dinner, I was saying that there seemed to

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 689</span>
be not only a community of interest between the two riparian authorities on the Thames Estuary but also a community of interest between the Minister and most of my hon. Friends and myself in that we all recognised a particular problem. I thought that the Minister would give a straight <i>non possumus</i> kind of answer to the request for a metropolitan county, but he did not. He is clear and honest, and he understands the point. However, I was a little startled when he talked about London, because he seemed to envisage that, if not at this moment, at some time it might be possible to consider a Metropolitan Thameside County which would be likely to extend westwards into London, on the south side, into those areas of Greater London which once were Kent, such as Bexley or Bromley, and on the north side into those areas which were once Essex. I am not talking historically, but I am speaking of boundaries that were revised a mere seven, eight or nine years ago.<br><br>
I found the situation interesting. I hope that the Minister will agree that it does not conflict with my idea of stopping—I dare not say "megalopolis" in view of his reproof and I do not know what to call it—a super-London; a super-capital, a capital already too large, which I fear might grow larger still. Such an idea would not necessarily conflict with my ideas on the subject and might also stop London expanding.<br><br>
If the Minister's population figure for every proposed metropolitan district were to be over 250,000 now, I would have no objection. My objection arises from our starting with a population of 183,000 and rising to a maximum population of 242,000. That is Amendment No. 441. With great respect to my hon. Friend the Member for Flint, East (Mr. Barry Jones), who tried hard, the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) and the hon. Member for Dartford (Mr. Trew) would agree with us that, if forced to choose between Amendment No. 426 and Amendment No. 441, we would go for No. 441. There is common ground in the Committee on that.<br><br>
The Minister is starting with 183,000, which is not really enough. I am grateful for the correct figure for South Shields. I knew that there was an authority with a smaller population, but I was not certain which, or what the figure was, and I was,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 690</span>
perhaps, drawing badly on my memory. If they were all over 250,000, there would be almost an overwhelming case. If I understand the Minister correctly, he went on to say that, within the next 10 to 15 years, the time might well come when the population would have increased to 250,000, or when we might consider hiving off part of what is now Greater London to give them the population.<br><br>
In principle, those arguments give the metropolitan county its head. The Minister is saying that, philosophically, that is probably right. There is probably a community of interest, and so on, between them, but at this moment in time it is premature. The time will come. Leave it to the Boundary Commission, or, if necessary, as he points out, by Clause 49 the Minister has power to say rather earlier that it should be looked at again, and that can be done.<br><br>
That is all very well, but, if we concede the principle, should we not consider doing it now? Are the figures so low, do they fall so much behind the Minister's norm, that we are prepared to wait 10 to 15 years for the Boundary Commission, or 7 to 10 years should the Minister choose to intervene? And where lies the advantage in doing so?<br><br>
There is a question of face in all this. Having decided in the past decade that London is now Greater London, including this and that area, one might be loath to interfere with it so soon. I put it to the Minister that, when the relevant legislation was enacted for Greater London, nobody envisaged a large-scale local government reorganisation outside London. So that does not arise. If that does not arise, and if the Minister accepts the underlying philosophy—and he appeared to go even further than I in accepting that philosophy—are there material reasons why he should not interfere?<br><br>
I was astonished by one argument which he adduced. He said that basically this area would be dominated by Southend, Medway towns—District (<i>e</i>), excluding However, he ignored the fact that the Faversham—themselves run to a population of 199,000. I have the greatest respect and friendship for you, Sir Stephen, and for your splendid constituency, in which I have had the honour to speak from time to time on just and right causes. Nevertheless, the fact remains that if I were asked which would be the dominant
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0379">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 691</span>
growth area in time in such a metropolitan county. I would tend to think of the Medway towns rather than Southend.<br><br>
That is not to belittle Southend, which holds a position of great importance, but is simply because the Medway towns form such a great industrial area and are so tremendously capable of increased potential as to form the dominant area. However, the Minister said that he is not particularly interested in a dominant area. Thus it seems to me no bad thing that there should be south of the Thames in the Medway towns an area with a population of approximately 200,000, and north of the Thames an area with an approximately equivalent population, and that these might play the leading part.<br><br>
I return to the point that most of these districts have a smaller population than the Minister would like. The hon. Gentleman always puts his case fairly, but I am not quite happy about his view of District (<i>d</i>) which, after all, has a population of 242,000. If he is thinking in terms of areas of 250,000 the percentage difference is vry slight. District (<i>d</i>), therefore, would appear to meet the Minister's criterion. District (<i>e</i>), as I pointed out, could be made to meet that criterion by a simple juggling of populations as between the two Amendments, one giving a population of 300,000 and the other virtually 200,000, which is not very considerably below the Minister's ideal. District (<i>e</i>) is 230,000, which also does not fall very far short, while District (<i>b</i>) includes the new town of Basildon.<br><br>
I hope that I was not making a silly or trivial point in this respect, but the Minister did not reply to it. If I am right in saying that the population of new towns expands by at least 5,000 to 6,000—which. I suppose is compound interest—per year, by the time this Parliament has completed its normal term the area will presumably have reached the 250,000 level. Thus most of these areas will meet the Minister's population criterion. There remains District (<i>a</i>) which, I agree, is a long way behind the others, but which might be increased by additions from what is now Greater London. 8.30 p.m.<br><br>
The reason I make this point is that I started with a prejudice against the Thameside metropolitan county. It seemed to me a rather unreal concept.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 692</span>
Here was a curious kind of county hived off to old counties, perhaps the oldest counties in English history. To a Londoner who lives in Kent and as someone who has known these areas all my life, I found that it came rather as a jar. If I am a convert, I am a late convert. I have just begun to think that the evidence is weighted more strongly in favour of such an area within the terms of the Bill than the present situation.<br><br>
With all those prejudices against, it was not only the arguments of my hon. Friends, though they were strong, but the fact that the Amendments had appeared and one was forced to look at them to see how much real community sense there was in them that converted me. There is no political advantage for either side to be gained from them. There is only the certainty that this above all areas will grow in wealth, population and importance within a very short time.<br><br>
I am sorry that the Minister tried to introduce an element of controversy by taking the minority view in favour of the Common Market. Of course we have to trade with Europe: we have been trading ever since the days of the Phoenicians, and we shall continue to do so. I hope that our trade with Europe will increase year by year. But whether or not we go into the Common Market, the fact remains that this is a prosperous and growing area, and we must accept that. At the same time, we have a chance to make of this area something beautiful and something of which we can all be proud. It is part of our heritage, irrespective of party.<br><br>
Two years ago, when the headquarters of my then Ministry was at Lambeth Bridge House, I happened to look out of the window and observe swans swimming under Lambeth Bridge. I was told that this was the first time in 100 years that swans had ever been as far up the river, because it had been polluted over the years. This was one of those moments when one thought that Governments of either party had tried to do their best to play their part in making this a clean and beautiful river.<br><br>
We have the chance to do that with the estuary. However, I find myself a little concerned when the Minister says that he will try to get Essex and Kent working together. He is a man of enormous patience and some persistence, but it is a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0380">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 693</span>
terrifying prospect to think of the Minister or his successor trying to get Essex and Kent to do something about what all of us agree to be an environmental catastrophe. How much simpler it would be to consider an environmental unit, a unit which, with all the pressures, will help to clean up that part of the estuary and to make it something of which all of us may be proud.<br><br>
I said earlier that I had a number of queries to put to the Minister. I find that having started with queries I have become very much an advocate for a cause. Oddly, that was not my intention. My intention was to get the Minister to clarify his mind and perhaps ours on this issue.<br><br>
Cannot the Minister give us this assurance—and I do not think it is a very important assurance from his point of view for it is not one that will upset him unduly—that between now and Report he will consider the time element, that is to say, what his advisers tell him is likely to happen in terms of population, in terms of growth, in terms of development, in this area, even if he is unwilling at this moment to concede a Thameside county, so that we may have an indication of when he or his successor may consider that such a moment has arrived? That would be useful. It would certainly clarify my mind. As I have said, I have no great axe to grind. I have found myself simply more and more interested and perhaps almost convinced by an argument which I started by opposing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has invited me to clarify, but he has really invited me to speculate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And I cannot speculate any more than to say that I cannot envisage a Thameside county without co-operation from its powerful neighbours, both London and the two counties, Essex and Kent, in a form which we have not yet evolved. We have to think of new concepts of co-operation in local government before we can devise the proper form of co-operative local government in this area. In the Bill we have to deal with 351 pages and that is enough for me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not asking the Minister to commit himself, but is it one of his thoughts that eventually—"eventually" is the word I choose—some sort of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 694</span>
regional get together may take place? Is it the Crowther Report that he is thinking about when he talks about some new sort of approach?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not thinking of anything in particular. I am saying that we have not conceived the proper form of local government for this area in 10 or 20 years' time, and I think that doing any carving up now may damage the future irreparably by a too eager anticipation of what we ought to do.<br><br>
I want to stand by the two counties of Essex and Kent at the moment, and therefore comments about falling behind the norm on these districts, about the numbers of each district, the numbers of each county, are irrelevant to the major principle behind this proposal—I have been using them myself in arguments on the Amendment—which is that the authority proposed by the Amendment could not cope with what we need in future. I believe to do this sort of carve up at present would be damaging to the future.<br><br>
I do not want, by what I have said, to encourage either county to think that it has not a great future as a county. I believe that both Essex and Kent can continue as counties and then we can think what kind of co-operation we have to have among Greater London. Essex and Kent to produce the grand design which the right hon. Gentleman has mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although I hope that the Minister will think even further between now and Report, in the absence of the two sponsors of this Amendment I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I regret to tell the hon. Member that he may not withdraw the Amendment as he did not move it. Only the mover of the Amendment may withdraw it.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ernest Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 212, in page 184, line 14. column 1, leave out "Tyneside" and insert "Tyne-Wear".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That reception overwhelms me. I am sure if members of the public had only known that I was to speak, they, too, would have been here
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0381">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 695</span>
Amendment No. 212 deals with a name, and those who do not know Tyneside and Wearside and the North-East—may feel that we are making heavy weather of what is only a name. The Committee will be interested to know that three Tyneside M.P.s and two Wearside M.P.s signed the Amendment, and I come from the County of Durham and will be in the new county outside the metropolitan county if these proposals go through.<br><br>
I claim some connection with Sunderland; I was a member of the borough council there for eight years and therefore I understand the local feeling. I have been interested in all the correspondence in the local Press and the strong views about the proposal to call the new metropolitan county "Tyneside". There is strong feeling in Wearside and the borough of Sunderland, which will form the major part of the new District (<i>e</i>) in the metropolitan county.<br><br>
They have a proud history. There was a monastery there 1,200 years ago where the Venerable Bede pursued his learning. They have been building ships in the town of Sunderland for 600 years. We claim to be the biggest ship-building town in the world because the whole of the ship-building part of the river is actually within the town boundaries. It is interesting that the new metropolitan county will have an estimated population of 249,000; and the metropolitan District (<i>c</i>), which is the Wearside part of the county, will have a population of 325,000. It is the biggest district in the metropolitan county.<br><br>
Some people may not understand the feelings of local folk and may ask, "What is in a name? What does it matter?" But in all the discussions of the Bill we should bear in mind that we are dealing with people who are emotional, who have their loyalties and strong local feelings.<br><br>
Although I did not share any moments during the Recess when I forgot all about the Bill, on New Year's Day I took time off to go to a football match at Roker Park. There is never much to cheer there and on that day, although Sunderland won, the biggest cheer was when the half time score for Newcastle came through and Newcastle was losing. That shook me, because I do not share that partisan feeling.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 696</span>
I know that in the northern region we must work together. This change is put forward and supported by those in public life on both Tyne and Wear, as well as the Members of Parliament, not because of the wrong kind of rivalry, but to acknowledge the fact that the parts of the new area will have to work together. It is a metropolitan county which will cover Tyneside and Wearside.<br><br>
That is my reason for putting forward the Amendment and I hope that it will be sympathetically received. I hope that another Tyneside Member, my hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Mr. Blenkinsop), will have some comments on the Amendment.</span></p>
<p>8.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ted Leadbitter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This argument calls for brevity, because we are dealing with a name and none of the controversial issues of boundaries, populations, or rateable values arises. The Minister should note that the Amendment is supported by two hon. Members from Sunderland, one hon. Member from Durham, one right hon. Member from Newcastle, one hon. Member from Gateshead and one hon. Member from Wallsend. Now it is to have the support of the hon. Member for The Hartlepools (Mr. Leadbitter). It is bound to be suggested that I may need their help later. However, I suspect, because he is slap bang in the middle of the area in question, that there is also the hon. Member for South Shields (Mr. Blenkinsop).<br><br>
Boundaries drawn on rigid criteria, no matter how well defined, are often quite different from the boundaries resulting from intimate knowledge of and contact with the grass roots of areas. In that sense I find it difficult to discuss Tyneside, or Sunderland, or Teesside, on such rigid criteria. How much more difficult it must be for those charged with national responsibilities to find areas of agreement, no matter on what criteria they make their judgments!<br><br>
The White Paper suggests that names should take account of local desires. The northern boundary of this area is just north of Whitley Bay and the southern boundary is a little south of Seaham Harbour, covering equally the Tyne and is much local pride. In addition, the the Wear, two rivers around which there population of what might be called the basic and traditional Tyneside core in

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 697</span>
Metropolitan District (<i>a</i>) is about 331,000 and the population of the traditional Wearside Metropolitan District (<i>e</i>) is about 326,000. So we have not only geographical but population equality, and the rateable values are similar.<br><br>
There is no difference of principle on this issue and we should therefore opt for what the area itself wants. I gather that the area is not making strong representations about the boundaries. I understand that there is a general agreement on the Tyne and on the Wear about a name. It sounds odd. I have tried to say it a number of times, but "Tyne-Wear" does not slip off the tongue very easily. It has a kind of clumsiness about it. But that should not deter us from remembering how the names of our towns, villages and cities have developed so as to become commonplace so that their clumsiness is forgotten.<br><br>
There are some places in the Palace of Westminster where the furnishings jar with the general character of the building. An example is the clash of the interior decor of the Prince's Room with the young Victoria on her treble plinth. But in the course of time that clash has, fortunately, become assimilated into the general decor, and it is not only the dominant feature, but is the character of the whole room. Similarly, we should not reject a name simply because it does not slip off the tongue now. The common opinion on the Wear and the Tyne should be allowed. As there is no difficulty about boundaries or spread of population, and as there is equality in representation by Members of Parliament, in rateable values and in geography, this name should commend itself to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Arthur Blenkinsop</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is encouraging to have the support of a foreigner like my hon. Friend the Member for The Hartlepools (Mr. Leadbitter) for our Tyneside and Wearside problems. We welcome that support as well as that from other parts of the Kingdom. We have great good will towards one another on Tyneside and there is no desire to monopolise or even appear to monopolise control. As a Tynesider born and bred and likely to live there the rest of my life, I would say that there is much good will for a name of this sort, or any other name expressing the same idea but coming slightly easier off the tongue. I only add my support for the Amendment.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 698</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fergus Montgomery</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must admit that I am in rather strange company, but I was born on Tyneside and lived there much of my life, and I think that I know the area as well as do some hon. Members opposite. I was born on the County Durham side, which I always thought was the less smart side, of the River Tyne and I served as a Member of Parliament there from 1959 to 1964 when, alas, I was defeated and had to move to the Midlands.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kay Carter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Had to move to the Midlands?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Montgomery</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I was welcomed to the Midlands, rather like the hon. Gentleman opposite who had no connection with the Midlands when he first went there as a Member.<br><br>
As hon. Members opposite have said, this new area covers more or less the coastal zone round the mouth of the river Tyne, right down to the area around the mouth of the Wear. I think that the hon. Member for Durham, North-West (Mr. Armstrong) was right. There are rivalries in sport. Newcastle United and Sunderland are great rivals. If one goes to a match in Sunderland, and the local people hear that Newcastle are being beaten at half-time, there is great glee. But apart from sport a comradeship exists in this area. They all realise that they must work together.<br><br>
If this Amendment has the blessing of the local authorities in the area I hope that my hon. Friend will be able to accede to this request, and that the new area will be called Tyne-Wear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to say a few words in support of my friend and colleague the hon. Member for Brierley Hill (Mr. Montgomery) My hon. Friend the Member for Durham, North-East (Mr. Armstrong), who is a typical Whip, moved the Amendment with commendable brevity. He said that we need not make heavy weather of it. This is an unusual Amendment in some ways, because it is merely about nomenclature. There is no need for statistics and all manner of geographical, physical and financial terms to support such an Amendment. I did not put my name to it, but as an exile I am most happy to join here, like hon. Members opposite.<br><br>
I believe that I could have given a better title to the area than Tyne-Wear.

although I support that name. I think that we should have called it "Geordieland". That would have been absolutely synonymous—[<i>Interruption.</i>] That seems to have scared some hon. Members. There is a saying that:
<br><blockquote><p>"A rose by any other name would smell as sweet".</p></blockquote>
and we are all delighted about this.<br><br>
I want to comment on what was said by the hon. Member for Brierley Hill. There is no doubt—this was shown in the last war—that the North-East, or what we might term Northumbria, is unique in the sense of fellowship or comradeship, due mainly—though I would not wish to offend my Welsh colleagues—to the fact that it is a coalmining area and that it was in the coalfields that the sense of fellowship and comradeship—what I would even term "clan loyalty"—was built. People in the North-East are particularly clanny—a trait that is not met with in other places. They are not soft.<br><br>
It is particularly appropriate today that we should have an Amendment of this nature, dealing with the future of the earliest coalfield—"coals to Newcastle" is a very old saying—on a day like this when, in the Chamber below, the House is debating the future of our coalmining industry and the fate of our fathers, brothers and people in the coming months, when pits may close because of the dispute that is now tearing the guts out of our society.<br><br>
It is a happy thing that those of us who belong to the North-East can see the birth of a name—Tyne-Wear—that will unite us all, even if we are exiles, like the hon. Gentleman opposite and myself. I had a word a second or so ago about a foreigner. We adopt all who come. Those of us who have gone away, go back. We belong each to each other. We are a clan. Therefore I bless "Tyne-Wear" as a name.</span></p>
<p>9.0 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr, Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Names are very important; there is no doubt about that. People feel sincerely about the name of their area, particularly if it has traditions behind it which they love. This is a case where the gentleman in Whitehall does not know best. Even the gentlemen in Westminster do not know best. For that reason, in putting these names in the Bill the Govern-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 700</span>
ment leant heavily on consultations with the local authorities in the areas. On many occasions the Secretary of State has said that he is ready to receive any representations on names—even those in the Bill—from the local authorities concerned.<br><br>
In the case of this county we had only two proposals. One was "Tyneside" and the other was "Bede"—a name that has a great history in the area. The name "Bede" did not have a great following and "Tyneside" seemed to be the name that came naturally to people in the area. Sunderland made representations against using the name "Tyneside", and asked for a geographical name common to the whole area which did not mention either the Tyne or the Wear. It was pointed out that "Tyne" favoured four metropolitan districts and "Wear" merely one.<br><br>
How are we to decide on that basis? Sunderland, although giving a very good specification for the choice of name, did not suggest one. Only on these Amendments has the name "Tyne-Wear" come forward. There is a formidable list of names at the top of the Amendment, and therefore we cannot disregard its importance to the Committee.<br><br>
We have normally set ourselves against double-barrelled or concocted names. In some instances we may have to resort to double-barrelled names in order to meet the wish of the localities. We may have to resort to concocted names, such as "Tyne-Wear". I do not know whether the Committee would wish to let the terms of this debate be made known locally and decide it at a later stage, or to make a decision here and now.<br><br>
I only say that the name "Tyne-Wear" has not been fully aired in the county. We have had no reaction on the name. Having had this debate, it might be wise to hope that it will get publicity in the county and to return to it on Report. I merely make the suggestion; I am not advising the Committee, because I do not believe that we know what is the right thing to do. We must find out what the local people want.<br><br>
I hope that this debate gets some publicity. It is known that some Members favour "Tyne-Wear", but let us see the reaction of the locality. Alternatively, if the Committee wishes to vote on the matter, so far as I am concerned it will

be a very free vote.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the light of the Minister's assurance, and as he has indicated that he is willing to accept a name that would be suitable and would commend itself to the authorities concerned, we have no wish to impose a particular name, except that the name "Tyneside" isolates the rest of the region. I hope that my colleagues will accept the suggestion of the Minister and that if local folk have any suggestions to make as to a name, and we find a more suitable name than "Tyne-Wear", we shall be able to propose it on Report.<br><br>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that the Committee will forgive me if I confine my remarks merely to Amendment No. 223, which I move on behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for Blyth (Mr. Milne) in whose constituency the parish of Holywell is situated. The first thing that Members will notice is that this Amendment, as well as being supported by the hon. Member for Blyth, is also supported by the hon. Member for Tynemouth (Dame Irene Ward). That is a formidable degree of support on both sides of the House in favour of Holywell coming out of District (<i>a</i>) of Newcastle-upon-Tyne and returning, with the rest of the urban district of Seaton Valley, to the County of Northumberland.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Blyth advises me that this is the overwhelming wish of all the people in the village of Holywell. He has had numerous communications from school personnel—including the headmaster of the local school
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 702</span>
—and other individuals. Prior to the Recess—and during the Recess—he has been in close communication with all the inhabitants of this village. Although it may seem a small matter to hon. Members it is of great importance to the people concerned. They do not wish to be part of District (<i>a</i>). They feel that their associations are with the county area of Northumberland, which county, I understand, also supports that view—including the Chairman of the Northumberland County Council.<br><br>
The urban district of Seaton Valley has a fair amount of space compared with that of many urban districts, yet the wards of Backworth, Earsdon, Holywell and Shiremoor are to be taken out of that urban district and put into the Tynemouth district of whatever the new authority is named.<br><br>
Backworth, Earsdon and Shiremoor form an almost continuous development, linked to Whitley Bay. Then there is a distance of open land before the village of Holywell, which is itself linked with Seaton Delavel, a part of the urban district. I am sure that my hon. Friend who comes from that district appreciates that in this matter I am acting as an advocate without local knowledge. However, I know the cause is a worthy one when my hon. Friend the Member for Blyth so strongly pushes an Amendment for this village to go into the county area. It is a small matter in terms of the new District (<i>b</i>) and the population question, but to the people who live in Holywell it is an important matter. I therefore ask that the Minister, in accordance with paragraph 31 of the White Paper, accedes to the request of the hon. Member for Tynemouth (Dame Irene Ward) and the people of Holywell.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to refer to the other four Amendments in the group, which concern the relationships between the metropolitan county and the proposed Durham County.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 193, 194 and 195 would transfer the four parishes referred to from the Tyneside metropolitan county to the new non-metropolitan Durham County. After publication of the White Paper and before publication of the Bill Durham County Council put forward a detailed and well-argued case for keeping substantial parts of the metropolitan area in Durham.<br><br>
Amendment No. 207 refers to the Washington New Town. In Durham there
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0385">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 703</span>
has been some concern about the viability of the new county. In 1963. because of the serious unemployment situation, Lord Hailsham came to the area and then produced the Hailsham Report, which has been the subject of much comment and has been well studied since then. Referring back to that report, we are reminded that Lord Hailsham talked about the need for growth zones, where there would be substantial growth in industry, population, and so on. During those eight years some of the areas which were destined for the greatest growth have been taken away from Durham, and in the new proposals other areas will follow.<br><br>
I want to highlight this situation by giving two statistics. The Minister knows that there are 16 counties in the proposed new County 38, with lower populations than the proposed new Durham. However, there are only seven counties with less rateable value. Therefore, in a county like Durham, which has such an outstanding record in local government, educational development and so on, there are serious considerations, such as viability, population, rateable value and potential growth.<br><br>
Durham County Council—since the publication of the Bill and the access of the coast to the new Durham, with Peterlee and Easington coming to Durham as opposed to the proposals in the White Paper—is now making a case which is modest and reasonable, and which the Minister will probably have difficulty in not conceding. I can well imagine that the county council has said, "Well, let us bend over backwards in asking for Amendments which any reasonable body of folk would find difficulty in refusing". I refer to Amendments Nos. 193, 194 and 195. The suggestion is that Birtley, Lamesley, East Murton and Cold Hesledon shall come out of the metropolitan county and go into the new Durham county.<br><br>
These four parishes are in two rural districts, most of which will remain with Durham. Every district council and parish council supports the case. Local opinion is very strong. I know that the Minister has had a mammoth petition from the Birtley area. During the weekend I have had telephone calls. I have met some of the representatives, particularly from Birtley and Lamesley. They just cannot conceive of any other solution than remaining where their loyalties have always been.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 704</span>
I understand that 70 per cent. of the Birtley-Lamesley area—and it is a remarkable figure—have expressed the view that they ought to stay with Durham. I am assured that an even bigger percentage could be achieved if it were thought necessary to strengthen the case.<br><br>
You will remember, Sir Stephen, that when we were debating the unitary principle I argued that what we wanted was effective local government, and that people did not feel too strongly if they were being well governed and had simple recourse to those who were governing. In this case I am bound to say that because of the loyalties and some of the considerations that my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull (Mr. James Johnson) mentioned about the North-East community feeling, the closely-knit communities, and the mining communities, they feel very strongly about these matters.<br><br>
I was brought up in a West Durham pit community. One of the things for which I have always been grateful is that the fact that I went to the grammar school did not separate me from the other children who stayed on at what was then an all-age school until they were 14. I now represent that village where I grew up. There is no feeling of "Well, at 11, he went to another school". It surprised me, since I was brought up in a county borough, in Sunderland, to find that my own children usually found their friends from the school that they attended, since they lived in a much wider area. There was nothing like the close-knit, community feeling that is so typical of Durham, and of other parts of the country, certainly in Wales, and which must be experienced in order to be fully understood.<br><br>
9.15 p.m.<br><br>
I can say without fear of contradiction that local opinion, as expressed through women's organisations, through the British Legion, parish councils, urban and rural district councils, is unanimous that the natural local government area for these four parishes is, as it has always been, in the County of Durham. The truth is that they do not belong to the metropolitan county. Of course, we can study a map and work out statistics. It might interest the Minister to know that there is a part of Sunderland, Southwick, which until 1926 was an urban district council. It did not go to Sunderland until 1938 and I could not believe that anyone there felt that South-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0386">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 705</span>
wick was in any other place but Sunderland. Yet I still meet people who talk about Southwick of the pre-1926 days. They have not accepted the closely-knit borough in which they now reside and which serves them as a local government authority.<br><br>
Thus I cannot overstress the feeling which exists among all sections of the community that these parishes belong to the County of Durham. Certainly they are not needed by the metropolitan county. They would strengthen Durham, which is important in relation to the figures which I have quoted. I have received no advice that any section of the community would be upset if the Amendments were accepted. Nor would any of the criteria so clearly enunciated in the Second Reading debate and in this Committee by the Minister be challenged or disturbed in any way.<br><br>
I shall now deal briefly with the different parishes. Birtley has a population of 12,800. It is a residential and industrial parish, situated south of Gateshead and west of Washington New Town. The boundary south of Birtley follows the parish boundary between Birtley and Harraton, and runs through a built-up area on the north side of Chester-le-Street.<br><br>
Quite frankly, the boundary is unsatisfactory as a parish boundary. However, as a boundary between two major authorities it is a complete nonsense, since it separates the closely linked communities of Birtley and Chester-le-Street. The A1 motorway, which runs between Washington New Town and the built-up parts of Birtley, would be a much more sensible boundary, more clearly defined and easily understood.<br><br>
Another feature is the pattern of development. There is a continuous band of development between Chester-le-Street and Birtley. However, Birtley is separated from Gateshead by a spur of higher ground, and there is a distinct break in development, which is important. Sometimes when I am driving into Newcastle from west Durham it seems that it will not be long before there is peripheral sprawl from Chester-le-Street to the north of Gosforth. At the moment there is a green belt, representing the area between Birtley and Gateshead. The Ministry's inspectors have from time to time referred to the importance of this green belt. It seems to meet the criteria which are often laid down. It is important for the area, and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 706</span>
in connection with patterns of development there is a strong case for Birtley.<br><br>
I have already mentioned the tradition and the history of Birtley and Chester-le-Street. There is no doubt that they are a part of County Durham rather than of Gateshead. Despite the terrible period of pit closures, we in Durham have the biggest trade union demonstration in the world—certainly the biggest voluntary demonstration. On a Saturday in July no traffic at all is allowed into the City of Durham because of the numbers coming from Durham County, and not only miners and their wives. I never miss the gala, although I have never worked in the pit. On that day all sections of the community find an appeal, something which is a part of community life. The affinities and loyalties of those living at Birtley and at Lamesley have always been to Durham. There is no doubt that the common interest is towards Durham, and not towards Tyneside. The parish councils and the R.D.C.s have made that abundantly clear.<br><br>
The Minister will know that the county council has examined the creation of the districts within the county. No one can deny that Chester-le-Street R.D.C. with Chester-le-Street U.D.C. makes a natural district, which would constitute some 49,000 population, rising to 56,000 in 1974—well below the suggested figure for a district council. If Birtley was to come in with 12,800 and Lamesley with 4,200, that would make a viable district council.<br><br>
If the county is to be divided in another way, and the county has talked with the present urban districts and some agreement has been achieved—and if Birtley and Lamesley are excluded, it will create great difficulties for viable and acceptable district councils.<br><br>
Lamesley is a rural parish with a population of 4,200. The Gateshead western by-pass would provide a more sensible and better defined boundary than that now proposed. The environmental argument is strong. The Durham County Council has sought to restrict the southward extension of Gateshead and the oonurbation by means of the proposed south Tyneside green belt, and by providing land for development to the south of the green belt, principally at Washington New Town, and also at Chester-le-Street, Ouston and Birtley. There has been no stubbornness or reluctance on the part
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0387">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 707</span>
of the Durham County Council. The Minister would approve the insistence that the needs be met in accordance with a rational sub-regional plan—which is a matter on which authorities should agree. If we accept the present proposals we are inviting and encouraging the peripheral sprawl of the conurbation into the proposed green belt. Here is a recognisable community. Its history and tradition is with Durham, and all that I have said about Chester-le-Street holds true here.<br><br>
The pit in my village was one of the first to close, in the early 1950's, yet still the closely-knit and neighbourly community persists, as it does in this area. The Kibblesworth mining community has no place in the big conurbation, and the surrounding farming community also has the feeling for Durham. The parish council and the R.D.C. are firm in their minds. There is no hesitation, nor even a minority. They are all in favour of maintaining existing loyalties with Durham.<br><br>
I come to the other two parishes, East Murton and Cold Heseldon. These are two adjoining parishes in the northern part of the Easington rural district area. There are 9,000 people, most of them at Murton. Murton is separated from Cold Hesledon by the pit and the associated waste tips. As houses are being demolished in Cold Hesledon the families are being re-housed in Murton.<br><br>
Anybody who visits this place will get the feel of the community there. Murton is a big village, but it is a real mining community. It has everything from pigeon "crees" to working men's clubs. They hold their annual leek clubs and they are a closely-knit, neighbourly community. Their big day is the Durham Day, and it means a great deal to them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Sword-dancing?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Sword-dancing as well. It is a community where there is a neighbourliness, an affinity and a loyalty which is not seen in other parts of the country. Anybody visiting the place could not envisage these two parishes going into the big metropolitan county.<br><br>
There is a long-life pit in this area and the people have a big stake in the future of the coal industry. If a man is in the coal industry in the Durham coalfield his loyalties, affinities and connections are with Durham. The development of these
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 708</span>
Durham coalfields has been planned in a comprehensive manner. There are the relationships with the new town of Peterlee. Redevelopment in the mining villages is being taken all in one piece and involves the Durham County Council, the Easington Council, and the Department of the Environment. The Secretary of State visited the place and saw the work that was going on in reclamation, building new villages and village improvement work.<br><br>
The wishes of the area are beyond doubt. There is no dissenting voice. They are not only agreed but eagerly await the Government's decision. They just cannot believe that they will be placed in the big metropolitan county. That applies to all the organisations as well as individuals. The evidence is absolutely overwhelming.<br><br>
That is my case. I was born in the Durham area and brought up in this invigorating community life. I say that Durham is a most misunderstood county. It is a very beautiful county—it is not all pitheaps. But exceeding its beauty is the comradeship and the neighbourliness, and the full community life that is lived there. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, West (Mr. James Johnson) that much of it is the result of the common danger that was shared by the whole community during the great coalmining era.<br><br>
9.30 p.m.<br><br>
I am not talking about the wishes of people who have a stake in the future of local government, in the sense that they are thinking about their own position. I am talking about the deep-felt anxiety of people who like living in closely-knit communities, and are afraid. Sitting here, we may ask, "What is there to be afraid of?" But they are afraid of the great big impersonal communities that they see and are glad to escape from. The most exciting place for me in London is King's Cross, because that is the place I catch the train to get home to sanity and good will in Durham. It is even more exciting than this place.<br><br>
I make this plea because I know that people feel very deeply about these matters. The Amendments will not impinge on the criteria laid down by the Minister; they are eminently reasonable. Maybe Durham County Council has been overmodest in its demands.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0388">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 709</span>
I hope that the Minister will treat them sympathetically.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Johnson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The passionate speech to which we have just listened, with its undertone of nostalgia, is so evocative, coming from a Durham man, south of the Tyne, supporting his Durham Amendments. I think that I must, as a Northumbrian, since the Northumberland Amendment was moved by a Lancastrian, at least testify if no more. Who could have two more doughty opponents than the hon. Lady the Member for Tynemouth (Dame Irene Ward)—and I deliberately pronounce it "Tinmouth" in this atmosphere, and not Tynemouth—and the Member for Blyth (Mr. Milne)—or "Blith" as somebody once said to me mistakenly, being a southerner. If I may say, so, there is a certain team called Blyth Spartans which is shaking the football world at the moment. They may even play Arsenal, if they are lucky.<br><br>
In my youth I kicked footballs at Seaton Delaval and Blyth and Newsham and Seaton Burn and Holywell, and all these parts about which the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes) spoke so movingly. I can testify that they were open in those days, 40 years ago. There is no doubt whatever that this particular patch of land is in Northumberland county. No one could accept it as being within the Tyneside conurbation as such, and, as has been mentioned by my Durham colleagues, with the closing of pits today even more does the old tightly knit mining belt become more open.<br><br>
The village where I was born has just been bulldozed by the Coal Board and there is no longer a village where once there were 1,000 hewers at the coal face. The people have moved away, so the land is becoming open there with the closure of pits. There is no doubt that this Amendment is soundly based on movement of population, but physically the link was always there, near Seaton Delaval. It was never linked with the shipyards of Wallsend or even the beautiful seaside watering places of Whitley Bay, Monk-seaton and the like.<br><br>
I testify from local knowledge that this is a perfectly sound Amendment and I support my hon. Friend the Member for Widnes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blenkinsop</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I enter a mild caveat. My hon. Friend the Member for Widnes
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 710</span>
(Mr. Oakes) spoke with a great deal of force and with a great deal of local knowledge; knowledge which I too have of this area. This group of Amendments, even including Amendment No. 207, illustrate some of the stupidities of the Bill and the difficulties in which we are involved—to my mind, unnecessarily.<br><br>
For example, the change proposed in Amendment No. 223, which would bring the parish of Holywell back into Northumberland, is very modest, and I should think everyone would accept it. but it illustrates the difficulty that we are in with a Bill like this, even more so than do the other Amendments with regard to Co. Durham. It is the view of many of us that if we are to have these metropolitan counties they should not be drawn as tightly as the Minister has drawn them, yet my hon. Friends are proposing to draw them even tighter. This is a nonsense. I have made it clear that I do not like this set up at all. We have gone all wrong in our approach. We ought to have regarded it as necessary to have regional or provincial authorities. We could then have been much more flexible about the subsidiary authorities.<br><br>
The real point about questions like this is the anxiety about having really viable authorities. The Ministry and the Government have gone forward with these proposals for counties and districts and we are left, especially in relation to Northumberland, with a very weak position, even with the changes which have been made. Yet, on the other side, the changes are destructive of what I regard as the proper concept of a planning authority for the metropolitan area.<br><br>
That being so, quite frankly I think that we have an unsatisfactory decision on both sides. Even with the addition of Cramlington, which I can well understand being moved into the county, we still have, with regard to population, industry and so on, a weak county structure for the kind of planning responsibilities which are being placed with it. In addition, one is somewhat weakening the metropolitan county by trying to get a slightly more satisfactory county organisation.<br><br>
The whole thing is wrong. It is not exactly crazy, but—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member is going a little wide of the Amendment we are supposed to be discussing.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Blenkinsop</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am concerned both with the Holywell Amendment and with the other Amendments, but of them all that which I feel could be quite damaging is the proposal to restore Washington New Town and Washington back to the county instead of being with the metropolitan county. If one does that, I doubt whether it makes much sense to have a metropolitan county at all. It is important to retain these places within the metropolitan county, and I am sure that the Sunderland area would regard it as important to keep them as part of its industrial and population complex. Whatever is done about the other Amendments, I hope that that Amendment will not be pressed.<br><br>
I wish we were not in the fix, as I believe we are, that whichever line we take the result will be pretty anomalous and there will be some very peculiar situations around. I wish that even at this stage we could have a better basic system upon which to work.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for South Shields (Mr. Blenkinsop) said that the first Amendment, which deals with Holywell, proposed a modest change. That is true, but whether one draws the boundaries tightly or loosely, there will be these modest changes around the boundary. We must get them right. They are very important to the people in the areas, however small the village or however large the town. Amendment No. 223 would remove the Seaton Valley urban district ward of Holywell from the Tyneside District (<i>b</i>)—if I might correct the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes), who referred to (<i>a</i>) throughout—which is centred on Tynemouth, to Northumberland.<br><br>
The Bill divides Seaton Valley urban district so as to put Cramlington comprehensive development area, usually known as the Cramlington new town, into the county, into Northumberland. The Holywell ward is in two parts approximately equal in area divided by a stream called the Seaton Burn. North of the burn is the village of Holywell, where most of the 1,500 inhabitants of the ward live, and there is a continuous ribbon of development along the road north from the village to Cramlington. South of the burn there is almost no development at all in that ward. Because of that continuous development between Holy-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 712</span>
well village and Cramlington, and because the southern part of the ward south of Seaton Burn is undeveloped, and probably better placed in Northumberland, I advise the Committee that the Amendment is right, and the hon. Gentleman the Member for Widnes can collect another freemanship from Holywell!<br><br>
I turn to the other Amendments so ably argued by the hon. Gentleman the Member for Durham, North-West (Mr. Armstrong). First, he wished to move Washington urban district, with a population of 24,000, and which contains the Washington New Town, out of the conurbation and into the non-metropolitan county of Durham. This new town is part of the conurbation. It was built to provide a focal point for the renewal of that conurbation, it is firmly within that built-up area, at the hinge between Tyneside and Wearside and, with great respect, it would be a planning nonsense to have it in Durham and not within the conurbation.<br><br>
Durham County Council claims, I know, that it has the expertise necessary for the development of this town. The county council's experience is not to be denied, but that does not alter the fact that the new town is part of the metropolitan area and not part of Durham.<br><br>
Basing my further argument on that, I turn to the parish of Lamesley, which contains the residential area of Eighton Banks in the north-east of the parish, and which undoubtedly is a suburb of Gateshead. It contains part of the Team Valley industrial estate which extends across the Gateshead boundary into the northern part of Lamesley. There is therefore no good reason for moving this part of Lamesley, at least, out of the metropolitan area. It may be that further to the south-west one gets more into the countryside around Kibblesworth, and so on, and this may need boundary adjustment by the Boundary Commission. But this must come later, and I cannot concede that Lamesley should be taken out of the conurbation and put into Northumberland.<br><br>
I come now to Birtley. Right alongside Washington New Town, with a population of 12,800, it is properly in Tyneside. It is physically homogenous with Washington, even though the A1(M) divides it from the new town. They are both built up to the road. The county council admit-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1971-1972V004P0I0390">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 713</span>
ted that it is substantially built up residentially and is an industrial parish rather than a country parish. This again, to my mind, is definitely part of the conurbation and should be included with Washington, with certainly the north-east part of Lamesley in the conurbation.<br><br>
The boundaries of this conurbation in the south had been drawn fairly tightly. We moved them to the north in the course of consultation before the Bill was drafted. We had already taken Ouston out of the conurbation and put it into the county. This comes of conceding certain points—one is pressed for more But, in fact, the line comes at Birtley and Washington New Town, and any small anomalies within the parish boundaries can be adjusted by the Boundary Commission.<br><br>
9.45 p.m.<br><br>
Now I come to the two other parishes which the hon Gentleman the Member for Durham, North-West, mentioned, in what I would call the Easington corridor. Originally, when drawing the map before the Bill was printed—and, indeed, I think that I am right in saying before the Circular was issued forecasting the Bill—we thought of the Easington area along the coast as being taken away from Durham, as being either to the north with Sunderland or to the south with Hartlepools and Teesside. Looking at it again, and hearing the views of those in the district, and driving round and round the district myself, I came to the conclusion that it was quite right that there should be a corridor for Durham to the sea—what I call the Easington corridor.<br><br>
I then proceeded to draw the northern boundary of that area—the southern boundary of the Sunderland area. I thought I had a very good boundary. I found that the boundary which had been drawn for me officially ran right down a very beautiful dene, Hawthorn Dene, and it was crazy to put a boundary down there. Hawthorn Dene ought to have been in the county of Durham in that area. So I pushed the boundary a little bit north.<br><br>
I thought it was a good boundary, but now the hon. Member for Durham North-West says that it should be pushed farther north. From the local government, the planning and the development points of view it does not matter. In this case the villagers really do want to be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 714</span>
in Durham, and I see no local government or planning reason why it should not be so. I am merely pointing out that the Hawthorn Colliery is there and that that is tied to three other collieries in the Durham conurbation area. Perhaps we can adjust the boundary of that and eventually push Hawthorn Colliery up into Sunderland. These complications do arise. Nevertheless, if East Murton and Cold Hesledon really feel the way they do, as the hon. Member for Durham, North-West has expressed today, then I ask the Committee to accept his Amendment. However, I cannot agree to accept the Amendments with regard to Birtley, Lamesley and Washington New Town.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leadbitter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has gone a considerable way to help my hon. Friend the Member for Durham, North-West (Mr. Armstrong). I was intrigued by his experiences when motoring in the area and his intimate knowledge of Hawthorn Dene. It is an area which I know from childhood, and as an adult I have known it for about 20 years. I am satisfied when he says that he has done his best to get the right kind of boundary. It would be wrong of me to doubt him. But I do suggest that Durham, in particular, with conurbations to the north of the Tyneside and the area to the south-east of Teesside present peculiar and sometimes exceptionally difficult problems.<br><br>
Since the Minister has expressed his desire to be helpful and has said that he wants to get these boundaries right, perhaps he will keep a reasonably open mind during the Report Stage. Certainly Birtley should be considered again, and perhaps Seaham also. We shall not press this, and if the Minister will continue to keep an open mind in this respect we shall be quite happy to leave the matter as it is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oakes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to thank the Minister for acceding to our request with regard to Holywell. May I say, in reply to his kind remarks about the freedom of Hale, that with the freedom of Hale that I acquired, the freedom of Southend which he recommended and the freedom of Holywell which he has also suggested, between now and Thursday I should perhaps acquire a gaggle of geese and a flock of sheep so that I may enjoy my free grazing on Hale Shore, on the excellent

Essex Marshes and on the village green of Holywell.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for the way in which he has dealt with the Amendments. I am grateful about the two parishes in the Easington area. I am sure the public and. indeed, the hon. Member representing the area will want to continue to fight the case on Report.</span></p>
