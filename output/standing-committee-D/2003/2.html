	<div class='part_sub_title'>Provisions relating to civil partnerships mentioned in paragraph 2</div> <!-- part_sub_title -->
	<p>4 Paragraphs 5 to 7 apply where two people are subject to paragraph 2 but intend to register as civil partners of each other by signing a civil partnership schedule.</p>
	<p>5 (1) The fact that a notice of proposed civil partnership has been given must not be recorded in the register unless the registration authorityâ€”
	<ol>
	<li>is satisfied by the production of evidence that both the proposed civil partners have reached 21, and</li>
	<li>has received a declaration made by each of the proposed civil partners â€”</li>
	<ol>
	<li>specifying their affinal relationship, and</li>
	<li>declaring that the younger of them has not at any time before reaching 18 been a child of the family in relation to the other.</li>
</ol></ol>
	<ol>
	<li>Sub-paragraph (1) does not apply if a declaration is obtained under paragraph 7.</li>
	<li>A declaration under sub-paragraph (1)(b) must contain such information and must be signed and attested in such manner as may be prescribed by regulations.</li>
	<li>The fact that a registration authority has received a declaration under subparagraph (1)(b) must be recorded in the register.</li>
	<li>A declaration under sub-paragraph (1)(b) must be filed and kept by the registration authority.</li>
</ol></p>
	<p>6 (1) Sub-paragraph (2) applies if â€”
	<ol>
	<li>a registration authority receives from a person who is not one of the proposed civil partners a written statement signed by that person
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2003-2004D001P2I0018">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
which alleges that a declaration made under paragraph 5 is false in a material particular, and</li>
	<li>the register shows that such a statement has been received.</li>
</ol>
	<ol>
	<li>The registration authority in whose area it is proposed that the registration take place must not issue a civil partnership schedule unless a High Court declaration is obtained under paragraph 7.</li>
</ol></p>
	<p>7 (1) Either of the proposed civil partners may apply to the High Court for a declaration that, given that â€”
	<ol>
	<li>both of them have reached 21, and</li>
	<li>the younger of those persons has not at any time before reaching 18 been a child of the family in relation to the other,</li></ol>
there is no impediment of affinity to the formation of the civil partnership.
	<ol>
	<li>Such an application may be made whether or not any statement has been received by the registration authority under paragraph 6.</li>
</ol></p>
	<p>8 Section 14 (objection to proposed civil partnership) does not apply in relation to a civil partnership to which paragraphs 5 to 7 apply, except so far as an objection to the issue of a civil partnership schedule is made under that section on a ground other than the affinity between the proposed civil partners.</p>

	<p>1 (1) This Schedule applies whereâ€”
	<ol>
	<li>a civil partnership has been dissolved or annulled in a country or territory outside the British Islands by means of judicial or other proceedings (here the "overseas proceedings"), and</li>
	<li>the dissolution or annulment (here the "overseas determination") is entitled to be recognised as valid in Scotland.</li>
</ol>
	<ol>
	<li>This Schedule applies even if the date of the overseas determination is earlier than the date on which this Schedule comes into force.</li>
</ol></p>
	<div class='part'>PART 2</div> <!-- part -->
	<div class='part_title'>CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH COURT MAY ENTERTAIN APPLICATION FOR FINANCIAL PROVISION</div> <!-- part_title -->
	<p>2 (1) Subject to sub-paragraph (4), if the jurisdictional requirements and the conditions set out in sub-paragraphs (2) and (3), respectively, are satisfied, the court may entertain an application by one of the former civil partners or former ostensible civil partners, (here "A") for an order for financial provision.
	<ol>
	<li>The jurisdictional requirements areâ€”</li>
	<ol>
	<li>that A is domiciled or habitually resident in Scotland when the application is made,</li>
	<li>that the other former civil partner, or former ostensible civil partner, (here "B")â€”</li>
	<ol>
	<li>is domiciled or habitually resident in Scotland when the application is made,</li>
	<li>was domiciled or habitually resident in Scotland when A and B last lived together in civil partnership, or</li>
	<li>when the application is made is an owner or tenant of, or has a beneficial interest in, property in Scotland which has at some time been a family home of A and B, and</li>
</ol>
	<li>where the court is the sheriff, that when the application is made eitherâ€”</li>
	<ol>
	<li>A or B is habitually resident in the sheriffdom, or</li>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2003-2004D001P2I0120">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<li>property mentioned in sub-paragraph (2)(b)(iii) is wholly or partially in the sheriffdom.</li>
</ol></ol>
	<li>The conditions are thatâ€”</li>
	<ol>
	<li>B initiated the overseas proceedings,</li>
	<li>the application is made within 5 years after the overseas determination takes effect,</li>
	<li>the civil partnership (or ostensible civil partnership) had a substantial connection with Scotland,</li>
	<li>A and B are alive when the application is made, and</li>
	<li>(taking Part 3 of this Act to have been in force) a court in Scotland would have had jurisdiction to entertain an action for dissolution or annulment of the civil partnership, if such an action had been brought immediately before the overseas determination took effect.</li>
</ol>
	<li>Where the jurisdiction of the court to entertain proceedings under this Schedule would fall to be determined by reference to the jurisdictional requirements imposed by virtue of Part 1 of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982 (c. 27) (implementation of certain European conventions) or by virtue of Council Regulation (EC) No. 44/2001 of 22nd December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, thenâ€”</li>
	<ol>
	<li>satisfaction of the jurisdictional requirements set out in subparagraph (2) does not obviate the need to satisfy those so imposed, and</li>
	<li>satisfaction of those so imposed obviates the need to satisfy those set out in sub-paragraph (2).</li>
</ol></ol></p>
	<div class='part'>PART 3</div> <!-- part -->
	<div class='part_title'>DISPOSAL OF APPLICATIONS</div> <!-- part_title -->
	<p>3 (1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (2) to (5), Scots law applies in relation to an application made under paragraph 2 as it would apply were the application made in an action in Scotland for, as the case may be, dissolution or annulment of a civil partnership.
	<ol>
	<li>In disposing of an application made under paragraph 2 the court must exercise its powers so as to place A and B, in so far as it is reasonable and practicable to do so, in the financial position in which they would have been had that application been disposed of, in such an action in Scotland, on the date when the overseas determination took effect.</li>
	<li>In determining what is reasonable and practicable for the purposes of subparagraph (2), the court must have regard in particular toâ€”</li>
	<ol>
	<li>A and B's respective resources, both present and foreseeable, at the date the application is disposed of,</li>
	<li>any order made by a foreign court in or in connection with the overseas proceedings, being an orderâ€”</li>
	<ol>
	<li>for the making of financial provision, in whatever form, by A for B or by B for A, or</li>
	<li>for the transfer of property from A to B or from B to A.</li>
</ol></ol>
	<li>Subject to sub-paragraph (5), the court may make an order for an interim award of a periodical allowance whereâ€”</li>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2003-2004D001P2I0121">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<ol>
	<li>it appears from A's averments that in the disposal of the application an order for financial provision is likely to be made, and</li>
	<li>the court considers that such an interim award is necessary to avoid hardship to A.</li>
</ol>
	<li>Where but for paragraph 2(2)(b)(iii) the court would not have jurisdiction to entertain the application, the court may make no order for financial provision other than an orderâ€”</li>
	<ol>
	<li>relating to the former family home or its furniture and plenishings,
or</li>
	<li>that B must pay A a capital sum not exceeding the value of B's interest in the former family home and its furniture and plenishings.</li>

	<li>To the extent to which the Part 1 order is made having regard to any benefits under a pension arrangement, it may require the person responsible for the pension arrangement, if at any time any payment in respect of any benefits under the arrangement becomes due to the civil partner with pension rights, to make a payment for the benefit of the other civil partner.</li>
	<li>The Part 1 order must express the amount of any payment required to be made by virtue of sub-paragraph (2) as a percentage of the payment which becomes due to the civil partner with pension rights.</li>

	<li>The court's power under Part 1 to order a civil partner to pay a lump sum to the other civil partner includes the power to make by the order any of the provision in sub-paragraphs (3) to (5).</li>
	<li>If the person responsible for the pension arrangement has power to determine the person to whom the sum, or any part of it, is to be paid, the court may require him to pay the whole or part of that sum, when it becomes due, to the other civil partner.</li>
	<li>If the civil partner with pension rights has power to nominate the person to whom the sum, or any part of it, is to be paid, the court may require the civil partner with pension rights to nominate the other civil partner in respect of the whole or part of that sum.</li>
	<li>In any other case, the court may require the person responsible for the pension arrangement in question to pay the whole or part of that sum, when it becomes due, for the benefit of the other civil partner instead of to the person to whom, apart from the order, it would be paid.</li>
	<li>Any payment by the person responsible for the arrangement under an order made under Part 1 made by virtue of this paragraph discharges so much of his liability in respect of the civil partner with pension rights as corresponds to the amount of the payment.</li>
	<li>The powers conferred by this paragraph may not be exercised in relation to a pension arrangement whichâ€”</li>

	<li>No such application may be made without the leave of the court after the end of 6 months from the date on which representation in regard to the estate of that person is first taken out.</li>
	<li>The personal representatives of the person who has died are not liable for having distributed any part of the estate of the deceased after the end of the 6 month period on the ground that they ought to have taken into account the possibility that the court might allow an application under this paragraph to be made after that period by the person entitled to payments under the order.</li>

	<li>a maintenance calculation ("the calculation") is made with respect to one or more, but not all, of the children with respect to whom those payments are to be made, and</li>

the court may, in exercise of its powers under this Part to vary or discharge the order, direct that the variation or discharge is to take effect from the date on which the calculation took effect or any later date.

	<li>that provision is void, but</li>
	<li>any other financial arrangements contained in the agreementâ€”</li>
	<ol>
	<li>are not void or unenforceable as a result, and</li>

</ol>
as appear to the court to be just having regard to all the circumstances, including, if relevant, the matters mentioned in paragraph 17(3).</li>
	<li>The effect of the order is that the agreement is to be treated as if any alteration made by the order had been made by agreement between the partners and for valuable consideration.</li>

	<li>both the parties to the agreement are resident in Northern Ireland, and</li>
	<li>the court acts for a petty sessions district included in the county court division in which at least one of the parties is resident.</li>

	<li>by increasing the rate of the periodical payments which the agreement provides shall be made by one of the parties for the maintenance of the other,</li>

it may specify such term as it thinks fit as the term for which the payments or, as the case may be, the additional payments attributable to the increase are to be made under the altered agreement, except that the term must not extend beyond the limits in sub-paragraphs (2) and (3).
	<ol>
	<li>The limits if the payments are not to be secured areâ€”</li>

	<li>increasing the rate of the periodical payments which the agreement provides shall be made or secured by one of the parties for the maintenance of such a child.</li>
</ol>
	<li>The court, in deciding the term for which under the agreement as altered by the order the payments, or the additional payments attributable to the increase, are to be made or secured for the benefit of the child, must apply paragraph 36(2) to (5) (age limits) as if the order in question were a periodical payments or secured periodical payments order in favour of the child.</li>

	<li>that party ("A") dies domiciled in Northern Ireland.</li>
</ol>
	<ol>
	<li>Subject to sub-paragraphs (4) and (5), the surviving party or A's personal representatives may apply to the High Court or a county court for an order under paragraph 54 and accordingly, for the purposes of this paragraph, any reference in that paragraph to the court includes a reference to a county court (whether a civil partnership proceedings county court or not).</li>
	<li>If a maintenance agreement is altered by a court on an application made under sub-paragraph (2), the same consequences follow as if the alteration had been made immediately before the death by agreement between the parties and for valuable consideration.</li>
	<li>An application under this paragraph may not, without the leave of the High Court or a county court, be made after the end of 6 months from the date on which representation in regard to A's estate is first taken out.</li>
	<li>A county court has jurisdiction under this paragraph only if it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that, at the relevant date, the property included in A's net estate did not exceed Â£15,000 in value.</li>

	<li>A's personal representatives are not liable for having distributed any part of A's estate after the end of the 6 month period on the ground that they ought to have taken into account the possibility that a court might allow an application by virtue of this paragraph to be made by the surviving party after that period.</li>
	<li>Sub-paragraph (6) does not affect any power to recover any part of the estate so distributed arising by virtue of the making of an order in pursuance of this paragraph.</li>

it may make an order setting aside the disposition.</li>
	<li>If the court is satisfied, on an application by A in a case where an order has been obtained by A against B under any of the provisions mentioned in subparagraph (1), that B has, with the intention of defeating A's claim for financial relief, made a reviewable disposition, it may make an order setting aside the disposition.</li>
	<li>An application for the purposes of sub-paragraph (3) must be made in the proceedings for the financial relief in question.</li>

	<ol>
	<li>in a case falling within paragraph 59(2) or (3), that the disposition or other dealing would (apart from paragraph 59) have the consequence of defeating A's claim for financial relief, or</li>
	<li>in a case falling within paragraph 59(4), that the disposition has had the consequence of defeating A's claim for financial relief,</li>

it is presumed, unless the contrary is shown, that the person who disposed of or is about to dispose of or deal with the property did so or, as the case may be, is about to do so, with the intention of defeating A's claim for financial relief.</li>

	<li>creates on the land a statutory charge, and</li>
	<li>subject to section 88 of the 1970 Act (statutory charge to be void against purchaser in certain circumstances), renders liable to be set aside by the court at the instance of A any disposition of the land in contravention of the order.</li>
