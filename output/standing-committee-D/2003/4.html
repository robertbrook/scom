<p><b>1 Civil partnership</b>
<ol>
<li>A civil partnership is a relationship between two people of the same sex ("civil partners")â€”</li>

<ol>
<li>in England or Wales (under Part 2),</li>
<li>in Scotland (under Part 3),</li>
<li>in Northern Ireland (under Part 4), or</li>
<li>outside the United Kingdom under an Order in Council made under Chapter 1 of Part 5 (registration at British consulates etc. or by armed forces personnel), or</li>
</ol>
<li>which they are treated under Chapter 2 of Part 5 as having formed (at the time determined under that Chapter) by virtue of having registered an overseas relationship.</li>
</ol>
<li>Subsection (1) is subject to the provisions of this Act under or by virtue of which a civil partnership is void.</li>
<li>A civil partnership ends only on death, dissolution or annulment.</li>
<li>The references in subsection (3) to dissolution and annulment are to dissolution and annulment having effect under or recognised in accordance with this Act.</li>

<p><b>2 Formation of civil partnership by registration</b>
<ol>
<li>For the purposes of section 1, two people are to be regarded as having registered as civil partners of each other once each of them has signed the civil partnership documentâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>at the invitation of, and in the presence of, a civil partnership registrar, and</li>
<li>in the presence of each other and two witnesses.</li>
</ol>
<li>Subsection (1) applies regardless of whether subsections (3) and (4) are complied with.</li>
<li>After the civil partnership document has been signed under subsection (1), it must also be signed, in the presence of the civil partners and each other, byâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>each of the two witnesses, and</li>
<li>the civil partnership registrar.</li>
</ol>
<li>After the witnesses and the civil partnership registrar have signed the civil partnership document, the relevant registration authority must ensure thatâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>the fact that the two people have registered as civil partners of each other, and</li>
<li>any other information prescribed by regulations, is recorded in the register as soon as is practicable.</li>
</ol>
<li>No religious service is to be used while the civil partnership registrar is officiating at the signing of a civil partnership document.</li>

<li>either of them is under 16, or</li>
<li>they are within prohibited degrees of relationship.</li>
</ol>
<li>Part 1 of Schedule 1 contains provisions for determining when two people are within prohibited degrees of relationship.</li>
</ol></p>

<li>that each of the proposed civil partners has had a usual place of residence in England or Wales for at least 7 days immediately before giving the notice.</li>
</ol>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2003-2004D001P4I0019">Image</span>

<li>by the Registrar General.</li>
</ol>
<li>"The relevant information" meansâ€”</li>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2003-2004D001P4I0020">Image</span>
<ol>
<li>the name of the person giving the notice,</li>
<li>the name of that person's proposed civil partner, and</li>
<li>such other information as may be prescribed by regulations.</li>

</ol></p>
<p><b>11 Meaning of "the waiting period"</b></p>
<p>In this Chapter "the waiting period", in relation to a notice of proposed civil partnership, means the periodâ€”
<ol>
<li>beginning the day after the notice is recorded, and</li>
<li>subject to section 12, ending at the end of the period of 15 days beginning with that day.</li>
</ol></p>
<p><b>12 Power to shorten the waiting period</b>
<ol>
<li>If the Registrar General, on an application being made to him, is satisfied that there are compelling reasons because of the exceptional circumstances of the case for shortening the period of 15 days mentioned in section 11(b), he may shorten it to such period as he considers appropriate.</li>
<li>Regulations may make provision with respect to the making, and granting, of applications under subsection (1).</li>
<li>Regulations under subsection (2) may provide forâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>the power conferred by subsection (1) to be exercised by a registration authority on behalf of the Registrar General in such classes of case as are prescribed by the regulations;</li>
<li>the making of an appeal to the Registrar General against a decision taken by a registration authority in accordance with regulations made by virtue of paragraph (a).</li>
</ol>
</ol></p>
<p><b>13 Objection to proposed civil partnership</b>
<ol>
<li>Any person may object to the issue of a civil partnership schedule under section 14 by giving any registration authority notice of his objection.</li>
<li>A notice of objection mustâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>state the objector's place of residence and the ground of objection, and</li>
<li>be signed by or on behalf of the objector.</li>
</ol>
<li>If a notice of objection is given to a registration authority, it must ensure that the fact that it has been given and the information in it are recorded in the register as soon as possible.</li>
</ol></p>
<p><b>14 Issue of civil partnership schedule</b>
<ol>
<li>As soon as the waiting period in relation to each notice of proposed civil partnership has expired, the registration authority in whose area it is proposed that the registration take place is under a duty, at the request of one or both of the proposed civil partners, to issue a document to be known as a "civil partnership schedule".</li>
<li>Regulations may make provision as to the contents of a civil partnership schedule.</li>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2003-2004D001P4I0021">Image</span>
<li>The duty in subsection (1) does not apply if the registration authority is not satisfied that there is no lawful impediment to the formation of the civil partnership.</li>
<li>If an objection to the issue of the civil partnership schedule has been recorded in the register, no civil partnership schedule is to be issued untilâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>the relevant registration authority has investigated the objection and is satisfied that the objection ought not to obstruct the issue of the civil partnership schedule, or</li>
<li>the objection has been withdrawn by the person who made it.</li>
</ol>
<li>"The relevant registration authority" means the authority which first records that a notice of proposed civil partnership has been given by one of the proposed civil partners.</li>
</ol></p>
<p><b>15 Appeal against refusal to issue civil partnership schedule</b>
<ol>
<li>If the registration authority refuses to issue a civil partnership scheduleâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>because an objection to its issue has been made under section 13, or</li>
<li>in reliance on section 14(3),<br><br> either of the proposed civil partners may appeal to the Registrar General.</li>
</ol>
<li>On an appeal under this section the Registrar General must either confirm the refusal or direct that a civil partnership schedule be issued.</li>
</ol></p>
<p><b>16 Frivolous objections and representations: liability for costs etc.</b>
<ol>
<li>Subsection (3) applies ifâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>a person objects to the issue of a civil partnership schedule, but</li>
<li>the Registrar General declares that the grounds on which the objection is made are frivolous and ought not to obstruct the issue of the civil partnership schedule.</li>
</ol>
<li>Subsection (3) also applies ifâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>in reliance on section 14(3), the registration authority refuses to issue a civil partnership schedule as a result of a representation made to it, and</li>
<li>on an appeal under section 15 against the refusal, the Registrar General declares that the representation is frivolous and ought not to obstruct the issue of the civil partnership schedule.</li>
</ol>
<li>The person who made the objection or representation is liable forâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>the costs of the proceedings before the Registrar General, and</li>
<li>damages recoverable by the proposed civil partner to whom the objection or representation relates.</li>
</ol>
<li>For the purpose of enabling any person to recover any such costs and damages, a copy of a declaration of the Registrar General purporting to be sealed with the seal of the General Register Office is evidence that the Registrar General has made the declaration.</li>
</ol></p>
<p><b>17 Period during which registration may take place</b>
<ol>
<li>The proposed civil partners may not register as civil partners of each other on the production of the civil partnership schedule until the waiting period in relation to each notice of proposed civil partnership has expired.</li>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2003-2004D001P4I0022">Image</span>
<li>Subject to subsection (1), under the standard procedure, they may register as civil partners by signing the civil partnership schedule at any time during the applicable period.</li>
<li>If they do not register as civil partners by signing the civil partnership schedule before the end of the applicable periodâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>the notices of proposed civil partnership and the civil partnership schedule are void, and</li>
<li>no civil partnership registrar may officiate at the signing of the civil partnership schedule by them.</li>
</ol>
<li>The applicable period, in relation to two people registering as civil partners of each other, is the period of 12 months beginning withâ€”</li>

<li>because of illness or disability, that person ought not to move or be moved from the place where he is at the time when the statement is made, and</li>
<li>it is likely to be the case for at least the following 3 months that because of the illness or disability that person ought not to move or be moved from that place.</li>

<ol>
<li>the day on which the notices of proposed civil partnership are recorded, or</li>

</ol>
</ol>
<li>A medical statement must contain such information and must be made in such manner as may be prescribed by regulations.</li>
<li>A medical statement may not be made in relation to a person who is detained as described in section 19(2).</li>

</ol>
<li>The third is whereâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>two people wish to register as civil partners of each other in England and Wales, and</li>
<li>one of them ("A") is a member of Her Majesty's forces who is serving outside the United Kingdom and the other ("B") resides in England or Wales.</li>
</ol>
<li>For the purposes of the standard procedure, the procedure for house-bound persons and the procedure for detained personsâ€”</li>

<li>the civil partnership schedule is not to be issued by a registration authority unless A or B produces to that registration authority a certificate of no impediment issued to A under the relevant provision;</li>
<li>the applicable period is calculated by reference to the day on which B's notice is recorded and, where the standard procedure is used in the first and second cases, is the period of 3 months beginning with that day;</li>
<li>section 31 applies as if in subsections (1)(a) and (2)(c) for "each notice" there were substituted "B's notice".</li>

<li>comply with any requirement made under section 22.</li>
</ol>
<li>The notice must contain such information as may be prescribed by regulations.</li>
<li>Subsections (3) to (6) of section 8 (necessary declaration etc.), apart from paragraph (b) of subsection (4), apply for the purposes of this section as they apply for the purposes of that section.</li>
</ol></p>
<p><b>22 Evidence to be produced</b>
<ol>
<li>The person giving a notice of proposed civil partnership to a registration authority under the special procedure must produce to the authority such evidence as the Registrar General may require to satisfy himâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>that there is no lawful impediment to the formation of the civil partnership,</li>
<li>that the conditions in subsection (2) are met, and</li>
<li>that there is sufficient reason why a licence should be granted.</li>
</ol>
<li>The conditions are that one of the proposed civil partnersâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>is seriously ill and not expected to recover, and</li>
<li>understands the nature and purport of signing a Registrar General's licence.</li>
</ol>
<li>The certificate of a registered medical practitioner is sufficient evidence of any or all of the matters referred to in subsection (2).</li>
</ol></p>
<p><b>23 Application to be reported to Registrar General</b></p>
<p>On receiving a notice of proposed civil partnership under section 21 and any evidence under section 22, the registration authority mustâ€”
<ol>

</ol></p>
<p><b>24 Objection to issue of Registrar General's licence</b>
<ol>
<li>Any person may object to the Registrar General giving authority for the issue of his licence by giving the Registrar General or any registration authority notice of his objection.</li>

<li>state the objector's place of residence and the ground of objection, and</li>
<li>be signed by or on behalf of the objector.</li>

<ol>
<li>This section applies where a notice of proposed civil partnership is given to a registration authority under section 21.</li>
<li>The registration authority may issue a Registrar General's licence if, and only if, given authority to do so by the Registrar General.</li>
<li>The Registrar Generalâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>may not give his authority unless he is satisfied that one of the proposed civil partners is seriously ill and not expected to recover, but</li>
<li>if so satisfied, must give his authority unless a lawful impediment to the issue of his licence has been shown to his satisfaction to exist.</li>
</ol>
<li>A licence under this section must state that it is issued on the authority of the Registrar General.</li>
<li>Regulations may (subject to subsection (4)) make provision as to the contents of a licence under this section.</li>
<li>If an objection has been made to the Registrar General giving authority for the issue of his licence, he is not to give that authority untilâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>he has investigated the objection and decided whether it ought to obstruct the issue of his licence, or</li>
<li>the objection has been withdrawn by the person who made it.</li>

</ol>
<li>The person who made the objection is liable forâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>the costs of the proceedings before the Registrar General, and</li>
<li>damages recoverable by the proposed civil partner to whom the objection relates.</li>
</ol>
<li>For the purpose of enabling any person to recover any such costs and damages, a copy of a declaration of the Registrar General purporting to be sealed with the seal of the General Register Office is evidence that the Registrar General has made the declaration.</li>
</ol></p>
<p><b>27 Period during which registration may take place</b>
<ol>
<li>If a Registrar General's licence has been issued under section 25, the proposed civil partners may register as civil partners by signing it at any time within 1 month from the day on which the notice of proposed civil partnership was given.</li>
<li>If they do not register as civil partners by signing the licence within the 1 month periodâ€”</li>
<ol>

Introduction</div> <!-- chapter_sub_title -->
<p><b>37 Powers to make orders and effect of orders</b>
<ol>
<li>The court may, in accordance with this Chapterâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>make an order (a "dissolution order") which dissolves a civil partnership on the ground that it has broken down irretrievably;</li>
<li>make an order (a "nullity order") which annuls a civil partnership which is void or voidable;</li>
<li>make an order (a "presumption of death order") which dissolves a civil partnership on the ground that one of the civil partners is presumed to be dead;</li>
<li>make an order (a "separation order") which provides for the separation of the civil partners.</li>
</ol>
<li>Every dissolution, nullity or presumption of death orderâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>is, in the first instance, a conditional order, and</li>
<li>may not be made final before the end of the prescribed period (see section 38);<br><br> and any reference in this Chapter to a conditional order is to be read accordingly.</li>
</ol>
<li>A nullity order made where a civil partnership is voidable annuls the civil partnership only as respects any time after the order has been made final, and the civil partnership is to be treated (despite the order) as if it had existed up to that time.</li>
<li>In this Chapter, other than in sections 58 to 61, "the court" meansâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>the High Court, or</li>
<li>if a county court has jurisdiction by virtue of Part 5 of the Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984 (c. 42), a county court.</li>
</ol>
<li>This Chapter is subject to sections 219 to 224 (jurisdiction of the court).</li>
</ol></p>
<p><b>38 The period before conditional orders may be made final</b>
<ol>
<li>Subject to subsections (2) to (4), the prescribed period for the purposes of section 37(2)(b) isâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>6 weeks from the making of the conditional order, or</li>
<li>if the 6 week period would end on a day on which the office or registry of the court dealing with the case is closed, the period of 6 weeks extended to the end of the first day on which the office or registry is next open.</li>
</ol>
<li>The Lord Chancellor may by order amend this section so as to substitute a different definition of the prescribed period for the purposes of section 37(2)(b).</li>
<li>But the Lord Chancellor may not under subsection (2) provide for a period longer than 6 months to be the prescribed period.</li>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2003-2004D001P4I0032">Image</span>
<li>In a particular case the court dealing with the case may by order shorten the prescribed period.</li>
<li>The power to make an order under subsection (2) is exercisable by statutory instrument.</li>
<li>An instrument containing such an order is subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament.</li>
</ol></p>
<p><b>39 Intervention of the Queen's Proctor</b>
<ol>
<li>This section applies if an application has been made for a dissolution, nullity or presumption of death order.</li>
<li>The court may, if it thinks fit, direct that all necessary papers in the matter are to be sent to the Queen's Proctor who must under the directions of the Attorney General instruct counsel to argue before the court any question in relation to the matter which the court considers it necessary or expedient to have fully argued.</li>
<li>If any person at any timeâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>during the progress of the proceedings, or</li>
<li>before the conditional order is made final,<br><br> gives information to the Queen's Proctor on any matter material to the due decision of the case, the Queen's Proctor may take such steps as the Attorney General considers necessary or expedient.</li>
</ol>
<li>If the Queen's Proctor intervenes or shows cause against the making of the conditional order in any proceedings relating to its making, the court may make such order as may be just as toâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>the payment by other parties to the proceedings of the costs incurred by him in doing so, or</li>
<li>the payment by the Queen's Proctor of any costs incurred by any of those parties because of his doing so.</li>
</ol>
<li>The Queen's Proctor is entitled to charge as part of the expenses of his officeâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>the costs of any proceedings under subsection (2);</li>
<li>if his reasonable costs of intervening or showing cause as mentioned in subsection (4) are not fully satisfied by an order under subsection (4)(a), the amount of the difference;</li>
<li>if the Treasury so directs, any costs which he pays to any parties under an order made under subsection (4)(b).</li>
</ol></ol></p>
<p><b>40 Proceedings before order has been made final</b>
<ol>
<li>This section applies ifâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>a conditional order has been made, and</li>
<li>the Queen's Proctor, or any person who has not been a party to proceedings in which the order was made, shows cause why the order should not be made final on the ground that material facts have not been brought before the court.</li>
</ol>
<li>This section also applies ifâ€”</li>
<ol>

Dissolution of civil partnership</div> <!-- chapter_sub_title -->
<p><b>44 Dissolution of civil partnership which has broken down irretrievably</b>
<ol>
<li>Subject to section 41, an application for a dissolution order may be made to the court by either civil partner on the ground that the civil partnership has broken down irretrievably.</li>
<li>On an application for a dissolution order the court must inquire, so far as it reasonably can, intoâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>the facts alleged by the applicant, and</li>
<li>any facts alleged by the respondent.</li>
</ol>
<li>The court hearing an application for a dissolution order must not hold that the civil partnership has broken down irretrievably unless the applicant satisfies the court of one or more of the facts described in subsection (5)(a), (b), (c) or (d).</li>
<li>But if the court is satisfied of any of those facts, it must make a dissolution order unless it is satisfied on all the evidence that the civil partnership has not broken down irretrievably.</li>
<li>The facts referred to in subsections (3) and (4) areâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>that the respondent has behaved in such a way that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to live with the respondent;</li>
<li>thatâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>the applicant and the respondent have lived apart for a continuous period of at least 2 years immediately preceding the making of the application ("2 years' separation"), and</li>
<li>the respondent consents to a dissolution order being made;</li>
</ol>
<li>that the applicant and the respondent have lived apart for a continuous period of at least 5 years immediately preceding the making of the application ("5 years' separation");</li>
<li>that the respondent has deserted the applicant for a continuous period of at least 2 years immediately preceding the making of the application.</li>

<li>Subsection (2) applies ifâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>in any proceedings for a dissolution order the applicant alleges, in reliance on section 44(5)(a), that the respondent has behaved in such a way that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to live with the respondent, but</li>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2003-2004D001P4I0035">Image</span>
<li>after the date of the occurrence of the final incident relied on by the applicant and held by the court to support his allegation, the applicant and the respondent have lived together for a period (or periods) which does not, or which taken together do not, exceed 6 months.</li>
</ol>
<li>The fact that the applicant and respondent have lived together as mentioned in subsection (1)(b) must be disregarded in determining, for the purposes of section 44(5)(a), whether the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to live with the respondent.</li>
<li>Subsection (4) applies in relation to cases where the applicant alleges, in reliance on section 44(5)(b), that the respondent consents to a dissolution order being made.</li>
<li>Rules of court must make provision for the purpose of ensuring that the respondent has been given such information as will enable him to understandâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>the consequences to him of consenting to the making of the order, and</li>
<li>the steps which he must take to indicate his consent.</li>
</ol>
<li>For the purposes of section 44(5)(d) the court may treat a period of desertion as having continued at a time when the deserting civil partner was incapable of continuing the necessary intention, if the evidence before the court is such that, had he not been so incapable, the court would have inferred that the desertion continued at that time.</li>
<li>In considering for the purposes of section 44(5) whether the period for which the civil partners have lived apart or the period for which the respondent has deserted the applicant has been continuous, no account is to be taken ofâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>any one period not exceeding 6 months, or</li>
<li>any two or more periods not exceeding 6 months in all,<br><br> during which the civil partners resumed living with each other.</li>
</ol>
<li>But no period during which the civil partners have lived with each other counts as part of the period during which the civil partners have lived apart or as part of the period of desertion.</li>
<li>For the purposes of section 44(5)(b) and (c) and this section civil partners are to be treated as living apart unless they are living with each other in the same household, and references in this section to civil partners living with each other are to be read as references to their living with each other in the same household.</li>
</ol></p>
<p><b>46 Dissolution order not precluded by previous separation order etc.</b>
<ol>
<li>Subsections (2) and (3) apply if any of the following orders has been made in relation to a civil partnershipâ€”</li>
<ol>

<li>an order under Schedule 6 (financial relief in magistrates' courts etc.);</li>
<li>an order under section 33 of the Family Law Act 1996 (c. 27)(occupation orders);</li>
<li>an order under section 37 of the 1996 Act (orders where neither civil partner entitled to occupy the home).</li>
</ol>
<li>Nothing preventsâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>either civil partner from applying for a dissolution order, or</li>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2003-2004D001P4I0036">Image</span>
<li>the court from making a dissolution order,<br><br> on the same facts, or substantially the same facts, as those proved in support of the making of the order referred to in subsection (1).</li>
</ol>
<li>On the application for the dissolution order, the courtâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>may treat the order referred to in subsection (1) as sufficient proof of any desertion or other fact by reference to which it was made, but</li>
<li>must not make the dissolution order without receiving evidence from the applicant.</li>
</ol>
<li>Ifâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>the application for the dissolution order follows a separation order or any order requiring the civil partners to live apart,</li>
<li>there was a period of desertion immediately preceding the institution of the proceedings for the separation order, and</li>
<li>the civil partners have not resumed living together and the separation order has been continuously in force since it was made,<br><br> the period of desertion is to be treated for the purposes of the application for the dissolution order as if it had immediately preceded the making of the application.</li>
</ol>
<li>For the purposes of section 44(5)(d) the court may treat as a period during which the respondent has deserted the applicant any period during which there is in forceâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>an injunction granted by the High Court or a county court which excludes the respondent from the civil partnership home, or</li>
<li>an order under section 33 or 37 of the 1996 Act which prohibits the respondent from occupying a dwellingâ€”house in which the applicant and the respondent have, or at any time have had, a civil partnership home.</li>
</ol></ol></p>
<p><b>47 Refusal of dissolution in 5 year separation cases on grounds of grave hardship</b>
<ol>
<li>The respondent to an application for a dissolution order in which the applicant alleges 5 years' separation may oppose the making of an order on the ground thatâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>the dissolution of the civil partnership will result in grave financial or other hardship to him, and</li>
<li>it would in all the circumstances be wrong to dissolve the civil partnership.</li>
</ol>
<li>Subsection (3) applies ifâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>the making of a dissolution order is opposed under this section,</li>
<li>the court finds that the applicant is entitled to rely in support of his application on the fact of 5 years' separation and makes no such finding as to any other fact mentioned in section 44(5), and</li>
<li>apart from this section, the court would make a dissolution order.</li>
</ol>
<li>The court mustâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>consider all the circumstances, including the conduct of the civil partners and the interests of the civil partners and of any children or other persons concerned, and</li>
<li>if it is of the opinion that the ground mentioned in subsection (1) is made out, dismiss the application for the dissolution order.</li>
</ol>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2003-2004D001P4I0037">Image</span>
<li>"Hardship" includes the loss of the chance of acquiring any benefit which the respondent might acquire if the civil partnership were not dissolved.</li>
</ol></p>
<p><b>48 Proceedings before order made final: protection for respondent in separation cases</b>
<ol>
<li>The court may, on an application made by the respondent, rescind a conditional dissolution order ifâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>it made the order on the basis of a finding that the applicant was entitled to rely on the fact of 2 years' separation coupled with the respondent's consent to a dissolution order being made,</li>
<li>it made no such finding as to any other fact mentioned in section 44(5), and</li>
<li>it is satisfied that the applicant misled the respondent (whether intentionally or unintentionally) about any matter which the respondent took into account in deciding to give his consent.</li>

<li>has made no such finding as to any other fact mentioned in section 44(5).</li>
</ol></ol>
<li>The court hearing an application by the respondent under subsection (2) must consider all the circumstances, includingâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>the age, health, conduct, earning capacity, financial resources and financial obligations of each of the parties, and</li>
<li>the financial position of the respondent as, having regard to the dissolution, it is likely to be after the death of the applicant should the applicant die first.</li>
</ol>
<li>Subject to subsection (5), the court must not make the order final unless it is satisfied thatâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>the applicant should not be required to make any financial provision for the respondent, or</li>

<p><b>49 Grounds on which civil partnership is void</b>
<ol>
<li>Where two people register as civil partners of each other in England and Wales, the civil partnership is void ifâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>at the time when they do so, they are not eligible to register as civil partners of each other under Chapter 1 (see section 3),</li>
<li>at the time when they do so they both know â€”</li>
<ol>
<li>that due notice of proposed civil partnership has not been given,</li>
<li>that the civil partnership document has not been duly issued,</li>
<li>that the civil partnership document is void under section 17(3) or 27(2)(registration after end of time allowed for registering),</li>
<li>that the place of registration is a place other than that specified in the notices (or notice) of proposed civil partnership and the civil partnership document, or</li>
<li>that a civil partnership registrar is not present, or</li>
</ol>
<li>the civil partnership document is void under paragraph 6(5) of Schedule 2 (civil partnership between child and another person forbidden).</li>
</ol></ol></p>
<p><b>50 Grounds on which civil partnership is voidable</b>
<ol>
<li>Where two people register as civil partners of each other in England and Wales, the civil partnership is voidable ifâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>either of them did not validly consent to its formation (whether as a result of duress, mistake, unsoundness of mind or otherwise);</li>
<li>at the time of its formation either of them, though capable of giving a valid consent, was suffering (whether continuously or intermittently) from mental disorder of such a kind or to such an extent as to be unfitted for civil partnership;</li>
<li>at the time of its formation, the respondent was pregnant by some person other than the applicant;</li>
<li>an interim gender recognition certificate under the Gender Recognition Act 2004 (c. 7) has, after the time of its formation, been issued to either civil partner;</li>
<li>the respondent is a person whose gender at the time of its formation had become the acquired gender under the 2004 Act.</li>
</ol>
<li>In this section and section 51 "mental disorder" has the same meaning as in the Mental Health Act 1983 (c. 20).</li>
</ol></p>
<p><b>51 Bars to relief where civil partnership is voidable</b>
<ol>
<li>The court must not make a nullity order on the ground that a civil partnership is voidable if the respondent satisfies the courtâ€”</li>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2003-2004D001P4I0039">Image</span>
<ol>
<li>that the applicant, with knowledge that it was open to him to obtain a nullity order, conducted himself in relation to the respondent in such a way as to lead the respondent reasonably to believe that he would not seek to do so, and</li>
<li>that it would be unjust to the respondent to make the order.</li>
</ol>
<li>Without prejudice to subsection (1), the court must not make a nullity order by virtue of section 50(1)(a), (b), (c) or (e) unlessâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>it is satisfied that proceedings were instituted within 3 years from the date of the formation of the civil partnership, or</li>
<li>leave for the institution of proceedings after the end of that 3 year period has been granted under subsection (3).</li>
</ol>
<li>A judge of the court may, on an application made to him, grant leave for the institution of proceedings if heâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>is satisfied that the applicant has at some time during the 3 year period suffered from mental disorder, and</li>
<li>considers that in all the circumstances of the case it would be just to grant leave for the institution of proceedings.</li>
</ol>
<li>An application for leave under subsection (3) may be made after the end of the 3 year period.</li>
<li>Without prejudice to subsection (1), the court must not make a nullity order by virtue of section 50(1)(d) unless it is satisfied that proceedings were instituted within the period of 6 months from the date of issue of the interim gender recognition certificate.</li>
<li>Without prejudice to subsections (1) and (2), the court must not make a nullity order by virtue of section 50(1)(c) or (e) unless it is satisfied that the applicant was at the time of the formation of the civil partnership ignorant of the facts alleged.</li>

<p><b>52 Proof of certain matters not necessary to validity of civil partnership</b>
<ol>
<li>Where two people have registered as civil partners of each other in England and Wales, it is not necessary in support or the civil partnership to give any proofâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>that any person whose consent to the civil partnership was required by section 4 (parental etc. consent) had given his consent, or</li>
<li>that the civil partnership registrar was designated as such by the registration authority in whose area the registration took place;<br><br> and no evidence is to be given to prove the contrary in any proceedings touching the validity of the civil partnership.</li>

<li>Where two people have registered as civil partners of each other in England and Wales, the Lord Chancellor may by order validate the civil partnership if it appears to him that it is or may be void under section 49(b).</li>
<li>An order under subsection (1) may include provisions for relieving a person from any liability under section 31(2), 32(2) or 33(5) or (7).</li>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2003-2004D001P4I0040">Image</span>

<ul>
<li>For the purpose of affording reasonable facilities throughout Scotland for registration as civil partners, the Registrar General â€”</li>

<li>is to appoint such number of district registrars as he thinks necessary, and</li>
<li>may, in respect of any district for which he has made an appointment under paragraph (a), appoint one or more assistant registrars,</li>
</ol>
<li>as persons who may carry out such registration (in this Part referred to as "authorised registrars").</li>
</ul></p>
<p><b>88 Notice of proposed civil partnership</b>
<ol>
<li>In order to register as civil partners, each of the intended civil partners must submit to the district registrar a notice, in the prescribed form and accompanied by the prescribed fee, of intention to enter civil partnership (in this Part referred to as a "notice of proposed civil partnership").</li>
<li>A notice submitted under subsection (1) must also be accompanied byâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>the birth certificate of the person submitting it,</li>
<li>if that person has previously been married or in civil partnership and â€”</li>
<ol>
<li>the marriage or civil partnership has been dissolved, a copy of the decree of divorce or dissolution, or</li>

</ol>
<li>if that person has previously ostensibly been married or in civil partnership but decree of annulment has been obtained, a copy of that decree.</li>
</ol>
<li>If a person is unable to submit a certificate or decree required by subsection (2) he may instead make a declaration to that effect, stating what the reasons are; and he must provide the district registrar with suchâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>information in respect of the matters to which the certificate or document would have related, and</li>
<li>documentary evidence in support of that information,<br><br> as the district registrar may require.</li></ol>
<li>If a document submitted under subsection (2) or (3) is in a language other than English, the person submitting it must attach to the document a translation of it in English, certified by the translator as a correct translation.</li>
<li>A person submitting a notice under subsection (1) must make and sign the necessary declaration (the form for which must be included in any form prescribed for the notice).</li>
<li>The necessary declaration is a declaration that the person submitting the notice believes that the intended civil partners are eligible to be in civil partnership with each other.</li>
</ol></p>
<p><b>89 Civil partnership notice book</b>
<ol>
<li>On receipt of a notice of proposed civil partnership, the district registrar is to enter in a book (to be known as "the civil partnership book") supplied to him for that purpose by the Registrar General such particulars, extracted from the notice, as may be prescribed and the date of receipt by him of that notice.</li>
<li>The form and content of any page of that book is to be prescribed.</li>
</ol></p>
<p><b>90 Publicisation</b>
<ol>
<li>Where notices of a proposed civil partnership are submitted to a district registrar, he must, as soon as practicable after the day on which they are submitted (or, if the two documents are not submitted on the same day, after the day on which the first is submitted), publicise the relevant information and send it to the Registrar General who must also publicise it.</li>
<li>"The relevant information" means â€”</li>
<ol>
<li>the names of the intended civil partners, and</li>
<li>the date on which it is intended to register them as civil partners of each other, being a date more than 14 days after publicisation by the district registrar under subsection (1).</li></ol>
<li>Paragraph (b) of subsection (2) is subject to section 91.</li>
<li>The manner in which and means by which relevant information is to be publicised are to be prescribed.</li>

<p><b>91 Early registration</b>
<ul>
<li>An authorised registrar who receives a request in writing from one or both of two intended civil partners that they should be registered as civil partners of each other on a date specified in the request (being a date 14 days or fewer after publicisation by the district registrar under subsection (1) of section 90) may, provided that he is authorised to do so by the Registrar General, fix that date as the date for registration; and if a date is so fixed, paragraph (b) of subsection (2) of that section is to be construed as if it were a reference to that date.</li>
</ul></p>
<p><b>92 Objections to registration</b>
<ol>
<li>Any person may at any time before the registration in Scotland of two people as civil partners of each other submit in writing an objection to such registration to the district registrar.</li>
<li>But where the objection is that the intended civil partners are not eligible to be in civil partnership with each other because either is incapable ofâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>understanding the nature of civil partnership, or</li>
<li>validly consenting to its formation,<br><br> it shall be accompanied by a supporting certificate signed by a registered medical practitioner.</li>
</ol>
<li>A person claiming that he may have reason to submit such an objection may, free of charge and at any time when the registration office at which a notice of proposed civil partnership to which the objection would relate is open for public business, inspect any relevant entry in the civil partnership book.</li>
<li>Where the district registrar receives an objection in accordance with subsection(1) he mustâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>in any case where he is satisfied that the objection relates to no more than a misdescription or inaccuracy in a notice submitted under section 88(1)â€”</li>
<ol>
<li>notify the intended civil partners of the nature of the objection and make such enquiries into the matter mentioned in it as he thinks fit, and</li>
<li>subject to the approval of the Registrar General, make any necessary correction to any document relating to the proposed civil partnership, or</li>
</ol>
<li>in any other case â€”</li>
<ol>
<li>at once notify the Registrar General of the objection, and</li>
<li>pending consideration of the objection by the Registrar General, suspend the completion or issue of the civil partnership schedule in respect of the proposed civil partnership.</li>
</ol></ol>
<li>If the Registrar General is satisfied, on consideration of an objection of which he has received notification under subsection (4)(b)(i) thatâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>there is a legal impediment to registration, he must direct the district registrar not to register the intended civil partners and to notify them accordingly, or</li>
<li>there is no such impediment, he must inform the district registrar to that effect.</li>

<p><b>93 Place of registration</b>
<ol>
<li>Two people may be registered as civil partners of each other at a registration office or any other place which they and the local registration authority agree is to be the place of registration.</li>

<li>as the case may be, is informed under section 92(5)(b) that there is no such impediment,</li></ol>
<li>the 14 days mentioned in paragraph (b) of section 90(2) have expired (or as the case may be the date which, by virtue of section 91, that paragraph is to be construed as a reference to has been reached), and</li>
<li>the period which has elapsed since the day of receipt of the notices by him (or, if the two notices were not received on the same day, since the day of receipt of the later) does not exceed 3 months,<br><br> he is to complete a civil partnership schedule in the prescribed form.</li>
</ol>
</ul></p>
<p><b>95 Further provision as to registration</b>
<ol>
<li>Before the persons present sign in accordance with section 85 the authorised registrar is to require the intended civil partners to confirm that (to the best of their knowledge) the particulars set out in the civil partnership schedule are correct.</li>
<li>As soon as practicable after the civil partnership schedule has been signed, the authorised registrar must cause those particulars to be entered in a register (to be known as the "civil partnership register") supplied to him for that purpose by the Registrar General.</li>
<li>The form and content of any page of that register is to be prescribed.</li>

<ol>
<li>Where, apart from the provisions of this Chapter, one civil partner in a civil partnership is entitled, or permitted by a third party, to occupy a family home of the civil partnership (that civil partner being referred in this Chapter as an "entitled partner") and the other civil partner is not so entitled or permitted (a "non-entitled partner"), the non-entitled partner has, subject to the provisions of this Chapter, the following rightsâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>if in occupation, a right to continue to occupy the family home;</li>

</ol>
<li>The rights conferred by subsection (1) to continue to occupy or, as the case may be, to enter and occupy the family home include, without prejudice to their generality, the right to do so together with any child of the family.</li>
<li>In subsection (1), an "entitled partner" includes a civil partner who is entitled, or permitted by a third party, to occupy the family home along with an individual who is not the other civil partner only if that individual has waived a right of occupation in favour of the civil partner so entitled or permitted.</li>
<li>If the entitled partner refuses to allow the non-entitled partner to exercise the right conferred by subsection (1)(b), the non-entitled partner may exercise that right only with the leave of the Court of Session or the sheriff under section 25 103(3) or (4).</li>
<li>A non-entitled partner may renounce in writing the rights mentioned in paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (1) only â€”</li>

<li>in a particular family home, or</li>
<li>in a particular property which it is intended by the civil partners will become their family home.</li>
</ol>
<li>A renunciation under subsection (5) has effect only if, at the time of making the renunciation, the non-entitled partner swears or affirms before a notary public that it is made freely and without coercion of any kind.</li>
<li>In this Partâ€”</li>
<ul>
<li>"child of the family" means a child under the age of 16 years who has been accepted by both civil partners as a child of the family, and</li>
<li>"family" means the civil partners in the civil partnership, together with any child so accepted by them.</li>

<li>to make any payment due by the entitled partner in respect of rent, rates, secured loan instalments, interest or other outgoings (not being outgoings on repairs or improvements);</li>
<li>to perform any other obligation incumbent on the entitled partner (not being an obligation in respect of non-essential repairs or improvements);</li>

<li>to carry out such essential repairs as the entitled partner may carry out;</li>
<li>to carry out such non-essential repairs or improvements as may be authorised by an order of the court, being such repairs or improvements as the entitled partner may carry out and which the court considers to be appropriate for the reasonable enjoyment of the occupancy rights;</li>
<li>to take such other steps, for the purpose of protecting the occupancy rights of the non-entitled partner, as the entitled partner may take to protect the occupancy rights of the entitled partner.</li>
</ol>
<li>Any payment made under subsection (1)(a) or any obligation performed under subsection (1)(b) has effect in relation to the rights of a third party as if the payment were made or the obligation were performed by the entitled partner; and the performance of an obligation which has been enforced under subsection (1)(c) has effect as if it had been enforced by the entitled partner.</li>

<ol>
<li>without the consent of the other partner, on any of the items mentioned in paragraphs (a) and (d) of subsection (1);</li>

<p><b>103 Regulation by court of rights of occupancy of family home</b>
<ol>
<li>Where there is an entitled and a non-entitled partner, or where both partners are entitled, or permitted by a third party, to occupy a family home, either partner may apply to the court for an order â€”</li>
<ol>
<li>declaring the occupancy rights of the applicant partner;</li>
<li>enforcing the occupancy rights of the applicant partner;</li>
<li>restricting the occupancy rights of the non-applicant partner;</li>
<li>regulating the exercise by either partner of his or her occupancy rights;</li>
<li>protecting the occupancy rights of the applicant partner in relation to the other partner.</li>
</ol>
<li>Where one partner owns or hires, or is acquiring under a hire-purchase or conditional sale agreement, furniture and plenishings in a family home and the other partner has occupancy rights in that home, that other person may apply to the court for an order granting to the applicant the possession or use in the family home of any such furniture and plenishings; but, subject to section 102, an order under this subsection does not prejudice the rights of any third party in relation to the non-performance of any obligation under such hire-purchase or conditional sale agreement.</li>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2003-2004D001P4I0064">Image</span>
<li>The court is to grant an application under subsection (1)(a) if it appears to the court that the application relates to a family home; and, on an application under any of paragraphs (b) to (e) of subsection (1) or under subsection (2), the court may make such order relating to the application as appears to it to be just and reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the case includingâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>the conduct of the partners, whether in relation to each other or otherwise,</li>
<li>the respective needs and financial resources of the partners,</li>
<li>the needs of any child of the family,</li>
<li>the extent (if any) to whichâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>the family home, and</li>
<li>in relation only to an order under subsection (2), any item of furniture and plenishings referred to in that subsection, is used in connection with a trade, business or profession of either partner, and</li>
</ol>
<li>whether the entitled partner offers or has offered to make available to the non-entitled partner any suitable alternative accommodation.</li>
</ol>
<li>Pending the making of an order under subsection (3), the court, on the application of either partner, may make such interim order as it considers necessary or expedient in relation to â€”</li>
<ol>
<li>the residence of either partner in the home to which the application relates,</li>
<li>the personal effects of either partner or of any child of the family, or</li>
<li>the furniture and plenishings,<br><br> but an interim order may be made only if the non-applicant partner has been afforded an opportunity of being heard by or represented before the court.</li>
</ol>
<li>The court is not to make an order under subsection (3) or (4) if it appears that the effect of the order would be to exclude the non-applicant partner from the family home.</li>
<li>If the court makes an order under subsection (3) or (4) which requires the delivery to one partner of anything which has been left in or removed from the family home, it may also grant a warrant authorising a messenger-at-arms or sheriff officer to enter the family home or other premises occupied by the other partner and to search for and take possession of the thing required to be delivered, (if need be by opening shut and lockfast places) and to deliver the thing in accordance with the order.</li>
<li>A warrant granted under subsection (6) is to be executed only after expiry of such period as the court is to specify in the order for delivery.</li>
<li>Where it appears to the courtâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>on the application of a non-entitled partner, that the applicant has suffered a loss of occupancy rights or that the quality of the applicant's occupation of a family home has been impaired, or</li>
<li>on the application of a partner who has been given the possession or use of furniture and plenishings by virtue of an order under subsection(3), that the applicant has suffered a loss of such possession or use or that the quality of the applicant's possession or use of the furniture and plenishings has been impaired,<br><br> in consequence of any act or default on the part of the other partner which was intended to result in such loss or impairment, it may order that other partner

<li>Subject to subsection (3), the court is to make an exclusion order if it appears to it that to do so is necessary for the protection of the applicant or any child of the family from any conduct, or threatened or reasonably apprehended conduct, of the non-applicant partner which is or would be injurious to the physical or mental health of the applicant or child.</li>
<li>The court is not to make an exclusion order if it appears to it that to do so would be unjustified or unreasonableâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>having regard to all the circumstances of the case including the matters specified in paragraphs (a) to (e) of section 103(3), and</li>
<li>where the family homeâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>is, or is part of, an agricultural holding within the meaning of section 1 of the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act 1991 (c. 55), or</li>
<li>is let, or is a home in respect of which possession is given, to the non-applicant partner or to both partners by an employer as an incident of employment,<br><br> having regard to any requirement that the non-applicant partner, or, as the case may be, both partners must reside in the family home and to the likely consequences of the exclusion of the non-applicant partner from the family home.</li>
</ol></ol>
<li>In making an exclusion order the court is, on the application of the applicant partnerâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>to grant a warrant for the summary ejection of the non-applicant partner from the family home unless the non-applicant partner satisfies the court that it is unnecessary for it to grant such a remedy,</li>
<li>to grant an interdict prohibiting the non-applicant partner from entering the family home without the express permission of the applicant, and</li>
<li>to grant an interdict prohibiting the removal by the non-applicant partner, except with the written consent of the applicant or by a further order of the court, of any furniture and plenishings in the family home unless the non-applicant partner satisfies the court that it is unnecessary for it to grant such a remedy.</li>
</ol>
<li>In making an exclusion order the court mayâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>grant an interdict prohibiting the non-applicant partner from entering or remaining in a specified area in the vicinity of the family home;</li>

<li>on the application of either partner, make such other order as it considers necessary for the proper enforcement of an order made under subsection (4) or paragraph (a), (b) or (c).</li>
</ol>
<li>Pending the making of an exclusion order, the court may, on the application of the applicant partner, make an interim order suspending the occupancy rights of the non-applicant partner in the family home to which the application for the exclusion order relates; and subsections (4) and (5) apply to such an interim order as they apply to an exclusion order.</li>
<li>But an interim order may be made only if the non-applicant partner has been afforded an opportunity of being heard by or represented before the court.</li>
<li>Without prejudice to subsections (1) and (6), where both partners are entitled, or permitted by a third party, to occupy a family home, it is incompetent for one partner to bring an action of ejection from the family home against the other partner.</li>

<ol>
<li>on the dissolution of the civil partnership,</li>
<li>subject to section 106(1), where there is an entitled and non-entitled partner, on the entitled partner ceasing to be an entitled partner in respect of the family home to which the order relates, or</li>
<li>where both partners are entitled, or permitted by a third party, to occupy the family home, on both partners ceasing to be so entitled or permitted.</li>

<li>Where a person has been arrested under section 114(4), the officer in charge of a police station mayâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>if satisfied that there is no likelihood of violence to the applicant civil partner or any child of the family, liberate that person unconditionally, or</li>
<li>refuse to liberate that person.</li>
</ol>
<li>For such refusal and the detention of that person until appearance in court by virtue of section 116(2) or of any provision of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1975 (c. 21) the officer is not to be subjected to any claim whatsoever.</li>
<li>Where a person arrested under section 114(4) is liberated under subsection (1), the facts and circumstances which gave rise to the arrest are to be reported forthwith to the procurator fiscal who, if he decides to take no criminal proceedings in respect of those facts and circumstances, is at the earliest opportunity to take all reasonable steps to intimate his decision to the persons mentioned in paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 116(5).</li>
</ol></p>
<p><b>116 Procedure after arrest</b>
<ol>
<li>The provisions of this section apply only whereâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>the non-applicant civil partner has not been liberated under section 115(1), and</li>
<li>the procurator fiscal decides that no criminal proceedings are to be taken in respect of the facts and circumstances which gave rise to the arrest.</li>
</ol>
<li>The non-applicant civil partner who has been arrested under section 114(4) is wherever practicable to be brought before the sheriff sitting as a court of summary criminal jurisdiction for the district in which that civil partner was arrested not later than in the course of the first day after the arrest, such day not being a Saturday, a Sunday or a court holiday prescribed for that court under section 8 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 (c. 46).</li>
<li>Nothing in subsection (2) prevents the non-applicant civil partner being brought before the sheriff on a Saturday, a Sunday or such a court holiday when the sheriff is, in pursuance of that section of that Act, sitting for the disposal of criminal business.</li>
<li>Subsections (1) to (3) of section 15 of that Act (intimation to a named person) apply to a non-applicant civil partner who has been arrested under section 114(4) as they apply to a person who has been arrested in respect of any offence.</li>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2003-2004D001P4I0074">Image</span>
<li>The procurator fiscal is at the earliest opportunity, and in any event prior to the non-applicant civil partner being brought before the sheriff under subsection(2), to take all reasonable steps to intimateâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>to the applicant civil partner, and</li>
<li>to the solicitor who acted for that civil partner when the interdict was granted or to any other solicitor who the procurator fiscal has reason to believe acts for the time being for that civil partner,<br><br> that the criminal proceedings referred to in subsection (1) will not be taken.</li>
</ol>
<li>On the non-applicant civil partner being brought before the sheriff under subsection (2) (as read with subsection (3)), the following procedures applyâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>the procurator fiscal is to present to the court a petition containingâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>a statement of the particulars of the non-applicant civil partner,</li>
<li>a statement of the facts and circumstances which gave rise to the arrest, and</li>
<li>a request that the non-applicant civil partner be detained for a 15 further period not exceeding 2 days,</li>
</ol>
<li>if it appears to the sheriff thatâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>the statement referred to in paragraph (a)(ii) ostensibly discloses a breach of interdict by the non-applicant civil partner,</li>
<li>proceedings for breach of interdict will be taken, and</li>
<li>there is a substantial risk of violence by the non-applicant civil partner against the applicant civil partner or any child of the family,<br><br> he may order the non-applicant civil partner to be detained for a further period not exceeding 2 days, and</li>
</ol>
<li>in any case to which paragraph (b) does not apply, the non-applicant civil partner is, unless in custody in respect of any other matter, to be released from custody.</li>
</ol>
<li>In computing the period of 2 days referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (6), no account is to be taken of a Saturday or Sunday or of any holiday in the court in which the proceedings for breach of interdict will require to be raised.</li>

<p><b>117 Dissolution</b>
<ol>
<li>An action for the dissolution of a civil partnership may be brought in the Court of Session or in the sheriff court.</li>
<li>In such an action the court may grant decree, if, but only if, it is established thatâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>the civil partnership has broken down irretrievably, or</li>
<li>an interim gender recognition certificate under the Gender Recognition Act 2004 (c. 7) has, after the date of registration of the civil partnership, been issued to either of the civil partners.</li>
</ol>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2003-2004D001P4I0075">Image</span>
<li>The irretrievable breakdown of a civil partnership is taken to be established ifâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>since the date of registration of the civil partnership the defender has at any time behaved (whether or not as a result of mental abnormality and whether such behaviour has been active or passive) in such a way that the pursuer cannot reasonably be expected to cohabit with the defender,</li>
<li>the defender has wilfully and without reasonable cause deserted the pursuer and during a continuous period of two years immediately succeeding the defender's desertionâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>there has been no cohabitation between the parties, and</li>
<li>the pursuer has not refused a genuine and reasonable offer by the defender to adhere,</li>
</ol>
<li>there has been no cohabitation between the civil partners at any time during a continuous period of two years after the date of registration of the civil partnership and immediately preceding the bringing of the action and the defender consents to the granting of decree of dissolution of the civil partnership, or</li>
<li>there has been no cohabitation between the civil partners at any time during a continuous period of 5 years after that date and immediately preceding the bringing of the action.</li>
</ol>
<li>Provision is to be made by act of sederuntâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>for the purpose of ensuring that, in an action to which paragraph (c) of subsection (3) relates, the defender has been given such information as enables that civil partner to understandâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>the consequences of consenting to the granting of decree, and</li>
<li>the steps which must be taken to indicate such consent, and</li>
</ol>
<li>as to the manner in which the defender in such an action is to indicate such consent, and any withdrawal of such consent,<br><br> and where the defender has indicated (and not withdrawn) such consent in the prescribed manner, that indication is sufficient evidence of such consent.</li>
</ol>
<li>Provision is to be made by act of sederunt for the purpose of ensuring that, where in an action for the dissolution of a civil partnership the defender is suffering from mental illness, the court appoints a curator <i>ad litem</i> to the defender.</li>
<li>In an action to which paragraph (d) of subsection (3) relates, even though irretrievable breakdown of the civil partnership is established the court is not bound to grant decree if in its opinion to do so would result in grave financial hardship to the defender.</li>
<li>For the purposes of subsection (6), hardship includes the loss of the chance of acquiring any benefit.</li>
<li>In an action for dissolution of a civil partnership the standard of proof required to establish the ground of action is on balance of probability.</li>
</ol></p>
<p><b>118 Encouragement of reconciliation</b>
<ol>
<li>At any time before granting decree in an action by virtue of paragraph (a) of section 117(2) for dissolution of a civil partnership, if it appears to the court that there is a reasonable prospect of a reconciliation between the civil partners it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2003-2004D001P4I0076">Image</span>
must continue, or further continue, the action for such period as it thinks proper to enable attempts to be made to effect such a reconciliation.</li>
<li>If during any such continuation the civil partners cohabit with one another, no account is to be taken of such cohabitation for the purposes of that action.</li>
</ol></p>
<p><b>119 Effect of resumption of cohabitation</b>
<ol>
<li>In an action to which paragraph (b) of section 117(3) relates, the irretrievable breakdown of a civil partnership is not to be taken to be established if, after the expiry of the period mentioned in that paragraphâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>the pursuer resumes cohabitation with the defender, and</li>
<li>cohabits with the defender at any time after the end of a period of 3 months commencing with the date of such resumption.</li>
</ol>
<li>Subsection (1) is subject to section 118(2).</li>
<li>In considering whether any period mentioned in paragraph (b), (c) or (d) of section 117(3) has been continuous, no account is to be taken of any period or periods not exceeding 6 months in all during which the civil partners cohabited with one another; but no such period or periods during which the civil partners cohabited with one another is to count as part of the period of non-cohabitation required by any of those paragraphs.</li>
</ol></p>
<p><b>120 Separation</b>
<ol>
<li>An action for the separation of the civil partners in a civil partnership may be brought in the Court of Session or in the sheriff court.</li>
<li>In such an action the court may grant decree if satisfied that the circumstances set out in any of paragraphs (a) to (d) of section 117(3) are established.</li>
</ol></p>
<p><b>121 Dissolution following on decree of separation</b>
<ol>
<li>The court may grant decree in an action for the dissolution of a civil partnership even though decree of separation has previously been granted to the pursuer on the same, or substantially the same, facts as those averred in support of that action; and in any such action the court may treat an extract decree of separation lodged in process as sufficient proof of the facts under which that decree was granted.</li>
<li>Nothing in this section entitles a court to grant decree of dissolution of a civil partnership without receiving evidence from the pursuer.</li>
</ol></p>
<p><b>122 Registration of dissolution of civil partnership</b>
<ol>
<li>The Registrar General is to maintain at the General Register Office a register of decrees of dissolution of civil partnership (a register which shall be known as the "Register of Dissolutions of Civil Partnership").</li>
<li>The Registrar General is to cause to be made and kept at the General Register Office an alphabetical index of the entries in that register.</li>
<li>The register is to be in such form as may be prescribed.</li>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2003-2004D001P4I0077">Image</span>
<li>On payment to him of such fee or fees as may be prescribed, the Registrar General must, at any time when the General Register Office is open for that purposeâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>cause a search of the index to be made on behalf of any person or permit any person to search the index himself,</li>
<li>issue to any person an extract of any entry in the register which that person may require.</li>
</ol>
<li>An extract of any entry in the register is to be sufficient evidence of the decree of dissolution to which it relates.</li>
<li>The Registrar General mayâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>delete,</li>
<li>amend, or</li>
<li>substitute another entry for,<br><br> any entry in the register.</li>

<li>such particulars as may be prescribed, taken from each civil partnership notice received by him, and</li>
<li>the date on which each civil partnership notice is received by him.</li>
</ol>
<li>In this Chapter "civil partnership notice book" means the record kept under subsection (1).</li>
<li>The registrar must, in accordance with any guidance issued by the Registrar General, place on public display a list containing in relation to each proposed civil partnership in respect of which the registrar has received a civil partnership noticeâ€”</li>

</ol></p>
<p><b>141 Power to require evidence of name etc.</b>
<ol>
<li>A registrar to whom a civil partnership notice is given may require the person giving it to provide him with specified evidence relating to each proposed civil partner.</li>

<ol>
<li>notify the proposed civil partners,</li>
<li>make such inquiries as he thinks fit, and</li>
<li>subject to the approval of the Registrar General, make any necessary correction to any document relating to the proposed civil partnership.</li>

<ol>
<li>by reason of serious illness or serious bodily injury, that person ought not to move or be moved from the place where he is at that time, and</li>

Introduction</div> <!-- chapter_sub_title -->
<p><b>161 Powers to make orders and effect of orders</b>
<ol>
<li>The court may, in accordance with this Chapterâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>make an order (a "dissolution order") which dissolves a civil partnership on the ground that it has broken down irretrievably;</li>
<li>make an order (a "nullity order") which annuls a civil partnership which is void or voidable;</li>
<li>make an order (a "presumption of death order") which dissolves a civil partnership on the ground that one of the civil partners is presumed to be dead;</li>
<li>make an order (a "separation order") which provides for the separation of the civil partners.</li>
</ol>
<li>Every dissolution, nullity or presumption of death orderâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>is, in the first instance, a conditional order, and</li>
<li>may not be made final before the end of the prescribed period (see section 162);<br><br> and any reference in this Chapter to a conditional order is to be read accordingly.</li>
</ol>
<li>A nullity order made where a civil partnership is voidable annuls the civil partnership only as respects any time after the order has been made final, and the civil partnership is to be treated (despite the order) as if it had existed up to that time.</li>
<li>In this Chapter "the court" has the meaning given by section 188.</li>
<li>This Chapter is subject to section 219 and sections 228 to 232 (jurisdiction of the court).</li>
</ol></p>
<p><b>162 The period before conditional orders may be made final</b>
<ol>
<li>Subject to subsection (2), the prescribed period for the purposes of section 161(2)(b) is 6 weeks from the making of the conditional order.</li>
<li>In a particular case the court dealing with the case may by order shorten the prescribed period.</li>
</ol></p>
<p><b>163 Intervention by the Crown Solicitor</b>
<ol>
<li>This section applies if an application has been made for a dissolution, nullity or presumption of death order.</li>
<li>The court may, if it thinks fit, direct that all necessary papers in the matter are to be sent to the Crown Solicitor who must under the directions of the Attorney General instruct counsel to argue before the court any question in relation to the matter which the court considers it necessary or expedient to have fully argued.</li>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2003-2004D001P4I0093">Image</span>
<li>If any person at any timeâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>during the progress of the proceedings, or</li>
<li>before the conditional order is made final,<br><br> gives information to the Crown Solicitor on any matter material to the due decision of the case, the Crown Solicitor may take such steps as the Attorney General considers necessary or expedient.</li>
</ol>
<li>If the Crown Solicitor intervenes or shows cause against the making of the conditional order in any proceedings relating to its making, the court may make such order as may be just as toâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>the payment by other parties to the proceedings of the costs incurred by him in doing so, or</li>
<li>the payment by the Crown Solicitor of any costs incurred by any of those parties because of his doing so.</li>
</ol>
<li>In this Chapterâ€”</li>
<ul>
<li>"the Attorney General" means the Attorney General for Northern Ireland; and</li>
<li>"the Crown Solicitor" means the Crown Solicitor for Northern Ireland.</li></ul>
</ol></p>
<p><b>164 Proceedings before order has been made final</b>
<ol>
<li>This section applies ifâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>a conditional order has been made, and</li>
<li>the Crown Solicitor, or any person who has not been a party to proceedings in which the order was made, shows cause why the order should not be made final on the ground that material facts have not been brought before the court.</li>
</ol>
<li>This section also applies ifâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>a conditional order has been made,</li>
<li>3 months have elapsed since the earliest date on which an application could have been made for the order to be made final,</li>
<li>no such application has been made by the civil partner who applied for the conditional order, and</li>
<li>the other civil partner makes an application to the court under this subsection.</li>
</ol>
<li>The court mayâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>make the order final,</li>
<li>rescind the order,</li>
<li>require further inquiry, or</li>
<li>otherwise deal with the case as it thinks fit.</li>
</ol>
<li>Subsection (3)(a)â€”</li>
<ol>
<li>applies despite section 161(2) (period before conditional orders may be made final), but</li>
<li>is subject to section 172(4) (protection for respondent in separation cases) and section 186 (restrictions on making of orders affecting children).</li>

<p><b>165 Time bar on applications for dissolution orders</b>
<ol>
<li>No application for a dissolution order may be made to the court before the end of the period of 2 years from the date of the formation of the civil partnership.</li>

<p><b>166 Attempts at reconciliation of civil partners</b>
<ol>
<li>This section applies in relation to cases where an application is made for a dissolution or separation order.</li>
<li>If at any stage of proceedings for the order it appears to the court that there is a reasonable possibility of a reconciliation between the civil partners, the court may adjourn the proceedings for such period as it thinks fit to enable attempts to be made to effect a reconciliation between them.</li>

Dissolution of civil partnership</div> <!-- chapter_sub_title -->
<p><b>168 Dissolution of civil partnership which has broken down irretrievably</b>
<ol>
<li>Subject to section 165, an application for a dissolution order may be made to the court by either civil partner on the ground that the civil partnership has broken down irretrievably.</li>
<li>On an application for a dissolution order the court must inquire, so far as it reasonably can, intoâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>the facts alleged by the applicant, and</li>
<li>any facts alleged by the respondent.</li></ol>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2003-2004D001P4I0095">Image</span>
<li>The court hearing an application for a dissolution order must not hold that the civil partnership has broken down irretrievably unless the applicant satisfies the court of one or more of the facts described in subsection (5)(a), (b), (c) or (d).</li>
<li>But if the court is satisfied of any of those facts, it must make a dissolution order unless it is satisfied on all the evidence that the civil partnership has not broken down irretrievably.</li>
<li>The facts referred to in subsections (3) and (4) areâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>that the respondent has behaved in such a way that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to live with the respondent;</li>
<li>thatâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>the applicant and the respondent have lived apart for a continuous period of at least 2 years immediately preceding the making of the application ("2 years' separation"), and</li>
<li>the respondent consents to a dissolution order being made;</li>
</ol>
<li>that the applicant and the respondent have lived apart for a continuous period of at least 5 years immediately preceding the making of the application ("5 years' separation");</li>
<li>that the respondent has deserted the applicant for a continuous period of at least 2 years immediately preceding the making of the application.</li>
</ol>
<li>The court must not make a dissolution order without considering the oral testimony of the applicant unless for special reasons it orders that such testimony be dispensed with.</li>
</ol></p>
<p><b>169 Supplemental provisions as to facts raising presumption of breakdown</b>
<ol>
<li>Subsection (2) applies ifâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>in any proceedings for a dissolution order the applicant alleges, in reliance on section 168(5)(a), that the respondent has behaved in such a way that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to live with the respondent, but</li>
<li>after the date of the occurrence of the final incident relied on by the applicant and held by the court to support his allegation, the applicant and the respondent have lived together for a period (or periods) which does not, or which taken together do not, exceed 6 months.</li>
</ol>
<li>The fact that the applicant and respondent have lived together as mentioned in subsection (1)(b) must be disregarded in determining, for the purposes of section 168(5)(a), whether the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to live with the respondent.</li>
<li>Subsection (4) applies in relation to cases where the applicant alleges, in reliance on section 168(5)(b), that the respondent consents to a dissolution order being made.</li>
<li>Rules of court must make provision for the purpose of ensuring that the respondent has been given such information as will enable him to understandâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>the consequences to him of consenting to the order, and</li>
<li>the steps which he must take to indicate his consent.</li>
</ol>
<li>For the purposes of section 168(5)(d) the court may treat a period of desertion as having continued at a time when the deserting civil partner was incapable of continuing the necessary intention, if the evidence before the court is such
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2003-2004D001P4I0096">Image</span>
that, had he not been so incapable, the court would have inferred that the desertion continued at that time.</li>
<li>In considering for the purposes of section 168(5) whether the period for which the civil partners have lived apart or the period for which the respondent has deserted the applicant has been continuous, no account is to be taken ofâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>any one period not exceeding 6 months, or</li>
<li>any two or more periods not exceeding 6 months in all,<br><br> during which the civil partners resumed living together.</li>
</ol>
<li>But no period during which the civil partners have lived with each other counts as part of the period during which the civil partners have lived apart or as part of the period of desertion.</li>
<li>For the purposes of section 168(5)(b) and (c) and this section civil partners are to be treated as living apart unless they are living with each other in the same household, and references in this section to civil partners living with each other are to be read as references to their living with each other in the same household.</li>

<p><b>170 Dissolution order not precluded by previous separation order etc.</b>
<ol>
<li>Subsections (2) and (3) apply if any of the following orders has been made in relation to a civil partnershipâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>a separation order;</li>
<li>an order under Schedule 16 (financial relief in court of summary jurisdiction etc.);</li>
<li>an occupation order under Article 11 of the Family Homes and Domestic Violence (Northern Ireland) Order 1998 (S.I. 1998/1071 (N.I.6) (occupation orders));</li>
<li>an order under Article 15 of that Order (orders where neither civil partner entitled to occupy the home).</li>
</ol>
<li>Nothing preventsâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>either civil partner from applying for a dissolution order, or</li>
<li>the court from making a dissolution order,<br><br> on the same facts, or substantially the same facts, as those proved in support of the making of the order referred to in subsection (1).</li>
</ol>
<li>On the application for the dissolution order, the courtâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>may treat the order referred to in subsection (1) as sufficient proof of any desertion or other fact by reference to which it was made, but</li>
<li>must not make the dissolution order without receiving evidence from the applicant.</li>
</ol>
<li>Ifâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>the application for the dissolution order follows a separation order or any order requiring the civil partners to live apart,</li>
<li>there was a period of desertion immediately preceding the institution of the proceedings for the separation order, and</li>
<li>the civil partners have not resumed living together and the separation order has been continuously in force since it was made,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2003-2004D001P4I0097">Image</span>
the period of desertion is to be treated for the purposes of the application for the dissolution order as if it had immediately preceded the making of the application.</li>
</ol>
<li>For the purposes of section 168(5)(d) the court may treat as a period during which the respondent has deserted the applicant any period during which there is in forceâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>an injunction granted by the High Court or a county court which excludes the respondent from the civil partnership home, or</li>
<li>an order under Article 11 or 15 of the Family Homes and Domestic Violence (Northern Ireland) Order 1998 (S.I. 1998/1071 (N.I. 6)) which prohibits the respondent from occupying a dwelling-house in which the applicant and the respondent have, or at any time have had, a civil partnership home.</li>
</ol></ol></p>
<p><b>171 Refusal of dissolution in 5 year separation cases on ground of grave hardship</b>
<ol>
<li>The respondent to an application for a dissolution order in which the applicant alleges 5 years' separation may oppose the making of an order on the ground thatâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>the dissolution of the civil partnership will result in grave financial or other hardship to him, and</li>
<li>it would in all the circumstances be wrong to dissolve the civil partnership.</li>
</ol>
<li>Subsection (3) applies ifâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>the making of a dissolution order is opposed under this section,</li>
<li>the court finds that the applicant is entitled to rely in support of his application on the fact of 5 years' separation and makes no such finding as to any other fact mentioned in section 168(5), and</li>
<li>apart from this section, the court would make a dissolution order.</li>
</ol>
<li>The court mustâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>consider all the circumstances, including the conduct of the civil partners and the interests of the civil partners and of any children or other persons concerned, and</li>
<li>if it is of the opinion that the ground mentioned in subsection (1) is made out, dismiss the application for the dissolution order.</li>
</ol>
<li>"Hardship" includes the loss of the chance of acquiring any benefit which the respondent might acquire if the civil partnership were not dissolved.</li>

<p><b>172 Proceedings before order made final: protection for respondent in separation cases</b>
<ol>
<li>The court may, on an application made by the respondent, rescind a conditional dissolution order ifâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>it made the order on the basis of a finding that the applicant was entitled to rely on the fact of 2 years' separation coupled with the respondent's consent to a dissolution order being made,</li>
<li>it made no such finding as to any other fact mentioned in section 168(5), and</li>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2003-2004D001P4I0098">Image</span>
<li>it is satisfied that the applicant misled the respondent (whether intentionally or unintentionally) about any matter which the respondent took into account in deciding to give his consent.</li>

<ol>
<li>has made a conditional dissolution order on the basis of a finding that the applicant was entitled to rely in support of his application on the fact of 2 years' or 5 years' separation, and</li>
<li>has made no such finding as to any other fact mentioned in section 168(5).</li>
</ol></ol>
<li>The court hearing an application by the respondent under subsection (2) must consider all the circumstances, includingâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>the age, health, conduct, earning capacity, financial resources and financial obligations of each of the parties, and</li>

</ol>
<li>The court must not make the order final unless it has, by order, declared that it is satisfied thatâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>the applicant should not be required to make any financial provision for the respondent,</li>
<li>the financial provision made by the applicant for the respondent isâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>reasonable and fair, or</li>
<li>the best that can be made in the circumstances, or</li>
</ol>
<li>there are circumstances making it desirable that the order should be made final without delay.</li>
</ol>
<li>The court must not make an order declaring that it is satisfied as mentioned in subsection (4)(c) unless it has obtained a satisfactory undertaking from the applicant that he will bring the question of financial provision for the respondent before the court within a specified time.</li>
<li>Subsection (7) applies if, following an application under subsection (2) which is not withdrawn, the court makes the order final without making an order under subsection (4).</li>
<li>The final order is voidable at the instance of the respondent or of the court but no person is entitled to challenge the validity of the order after it is made final on the ground that subsections (4) and (5) were not satisfied.</li>

Nullity</div> <!-- chapter_sub_title -->
<p><b>173 Grounds on which civil partnership is void</b></p>
<p>Where two people register as civil partners of each other in Northern Ireland, the civil partnership is void ifâ€”
<ol>
<li>at the time when they do so, they are not eligible to register as civil partners of each other under Chapter 1 (see section 138), or</li>
<li>at the time when they do so they both knowâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>that due notice of proposed civil partnership has not been given,</li>
<li>that the civil partnership schedule has not been duly issued,</li>
<li>that the place of registration is a place other than that specified in the civil partnership schedule, or</li>
<li>that a registrar is not present.</li>
</ol></ol></p>
<p><b>174 Grounds on which civil partnership is voidable</b>
<ol>
<li>Where two people register as civil partners of each other in Northern Ireland, the civil partnership is voidable ifâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>either of them did not validly consent to its formation (whether as a result of duress, mistake, unsoundness of mind or otherwise);</li>
<li>at the time of its formation either of them, though capable of giving a valid consent, was suffering (whether continuously or intermittently) from mental disorder of such a kind or to such an extent as to be unfitted for civil partnership;</li>
<li>at the time of its formation, the respondent was pregnant by some person other than the applicant;</li>
<li>an interim gender recognition certificate under the Gender Recognition Act 2004 (c. 7) has, after the time of its formation, been issued to either civil partner;</li>
<li>the respondent is a person whose gender at the time of its formation had become the acquired gender under the 2004 Act.</li>
</ol>
<li>In this section and section 175 "mental disorder" has the same meaning as in the Mental Health (Northern Ireland) Order 1986 (S.I. 1986/595 (N.I. 4)).</li>
</ol></p>
<p><b>175 Bars to relief where civil partnership is voidable</b>
<ol>
<li>The court must not make a nullity order on the ground that a civil partnership is voidable if the respondent satisfies the courtâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>that the applicant, with knowledge that it was open to him to obtain a nullity order, conducted himself in relation to the respondent in such a way as to lead the respondent reasonably to believe that he would not seek to do so, and</li>
<li>that it would be unjust to the respondent to make the order.</li>
</ol>
<li>Without prejudice to subsection (1), the court must not make a nullity order by virtue of section 174(1)(a), (b), (c) or (e) unlessâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>it is satisfied that proceedings were instituted within 3 years from the date of the formation of the civil partnership, or</li>
<li>leave for the institution of proceedings after the end of that 3 year period has been granted under subsection (3).</li>
</ol>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2003-2004D001P4I0100">Image</span>
<li>A judge of the court may, on an application made to him, grant leave for the institution of proceedings if heâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>is satisfied that the applicant has at some time during the 3 year period suffered from mental disorder, and</li>
<li>considers that in all the circumstances of the case it would be just to grant leave for the institution of proceedings.</li>
</ol>
<li>An application for leave under subsection (3) may be made after the end of the 3 year period.</li>
<li>Without prejudice to subsection (1), the court must not make a nullity order by virtue of section 174(1)(d) unless it is satisfied that proceedings were instituted within the period of 6 months from the date of issue of the interim gender recognition certificate.</li>
<li>Without prejudice to subsections (1) and (2), the court must not make a nullity order by virtue of section 174(1)(c) or (e) unless it is satisfied that the applicant was at the time of the formation of the civil partnership ignorant of the facts alleged.</li>
</ol></p>
<p><b>176 Proof of certain matters not necessary to validity of civil partnership</b></p>
<p>Where two people have registered as civil partners of each other in Northern Ireland, it is not necessary in support of the civil partnership to give any proofâ€”
<ol>
<li>that any person whose consent to the civil partnership was required by section 145 (parental etc. consent) had given his consent;</li>
<li>that the registrar was properly appointed under section 152; </li></ol>
and no evidence is to be given to prove the contrary in any proceedings touching the validity of the civil partnership.</p>
<p><b>177 Validity of civil partnerships registered outside Northern Ireland</b>
<ol>
<li>Where two people register as civil partners of each other in England or Wales, the civil partnership isâ€”</li>

OVERSEAS RELATIONSHIPS TREATED AS CIVIL PARTNERSHIPS</div> <!-- chapter_title -->
<p><b>212 Meaning of "overseas relationship"</b>
<ol>
<li>For the purposes of this Act an overseas relationship is a relationship whichâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>is either a specified relationship or a relationship which meets the general conditions, and</li>
<li>is registered (whether before or after the passing of this Act) with a responsible authority in a country or territory outside the United Kingdom, by two peopleâ€”</li>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2003-2004D001P4I0117">Image</span>
<ol>
<li>who under the relevant law are of the same sex at the time when they do so, and</li>
<li>neither of whom is already a civil partner or lawfully married.</li>
</ol>
<li>In this Chapter, "the relevant law" means the law of the country or territory where the relationship is registered (including its rules of private international law).</li>
</ol></ol></p>
<p><b>213 Specified relationships</b>
<ol>
<li>A specified relationship is a relationship which is specified for the purposes of section 212 by Schedule 20.</li>
<li>The Secretary of State may by order amend Schedule 20 byâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>adding a relationship,</li>
<li>amending the description of a relationship, or</li>
<li>omitting a relationship.</li>
</ol>
<li>No order may be made under this section without the consent of the Scottish Ministers and the Department of Finance and Personnel.</li>
<li>The power to make an order under this section is exercisable by statutory instrument.</li>
<li>An order which contains any provision (whether alone or with other provisions) amending Schedule 20 byâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>amending the description of a relationship, or</li>
<li>omitting a relationship,<br><br> may not be made unless a draft of the statutory instrument containing the order is laid before, and approved by a resolution of, each House of Parliament.</li>
</ol>
<li>A statutory instrument containing any other order under this section is subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament.</li>
</ol></p>
<p><b>214 The general conditions</b></p>
<p>The general conditions are that, under the relevant lawâ€”
<ol>
<li>the relationship may not be entered into if either of the parties is already a party to a relationship of that kind or lawfully married,</li>
<li>the relationship is of indeterminate duration, and</li>
<li>the effect of entering into it is that the parties areâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>treated as a couple either generally or for specified purposes, or</li>
<li>treated as married.</li>
</ol></ol></p>
<p><b>215 Overseas relationships treated as civil partnerships: the general rule</b>
<ol>
<li>Two people are to be treated as having formed a civil partnership as a result of having registered an overseas relationship if, under the relevant law, theyâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>had capacity to enter into the relationship, and</li>
<li>met all requirements necessary to ensure the formal validity of the relationship.</li>
</ol>
<li>Subject to subsection (3), the time when they are to be treated as having formed the civil partnership is the time when the overseas relationship is registered (under the relevant law) as having been entered into.</li>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2003-2004D001P4I0118">Image</span>
<li>If the overseas relationship is registered (under the relevant law) as having been entered into before this section comes into force, the time when they are to be treated as having formed a civil partnership is the time when this section comes into force.</li>
<li>This section is subject to sections 216, 217 and 218.</li>
</ol></p>
<p><b>216 The same-sex requirement</b>
<ol>
<li>Two people are not to be treated as having formed a civil partnership as a result of having registered an overseas relationship if, at the critical time, they were not of the same sex under United Kingdom law.</li>
<li>But if a full gender recognition certificate is issued under the 2004 Act to a person who has registered an overseas relationship which is within subsection (4), after the issue of the certificate the relationship is no longer prevented from being treated as a civil partnership on the ground that, at the critical time, the parties were not of the same sex.</li>
<li>However, subsection (2) does not apply to an overseas relationship which is within subsection (4) if either of the parties has formed a subsequent civil partnership or lawful marriage.</li>
<li>An overseas relationship is within this subsection if (and only if), at the time mentioned in section 215(2)â€”</li>
<ol>
<li>one of the parties ("A") was regarded under the relevant law as having changed gender (but was not regarded under United Kingdom law as having done so), and</li>
<li>the other party was (under United Kingdom law) of the gender to which A had changed under the relevant law.</li>
</ol>
<li>In this sectionâ€”</li>
<ul>
<li>"the critical time" means the time determined in accordance with section 215(2) or (as the case may be) (3);</li>
<li>"the 2004 Act" means the Gender Recognition Act 2004 (c. 7);</li>
<li>"United Kingdom law" means any enactment or rule of law applying in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.</li>
</ul>
<li>Nothing in this section prevents the exercise of any enforceable Community right.</li>
</ol></p>
<p><b>217 Person domiciled in a part of the United Kingdom</b>
<ol>
<li>Subsection (2) applies if an overseas relationship has been registered by a person who was at the time mentioned in section 215(2) domiciled in England and Wales.</li>
<li>The two people concerned are not to be treated as having formed a civil partnership if, at the time mentioned in section 215(2)â€”</li>
<ol>
<li>either of them was under 16, or</li>
<li>they would have been within prohibited degrees of relationship under Part 1 of Schedule 1 if they had been registering as civil partners of each other in England and Wales.</li>
</ol>
<li>Subsection (4) applies if an overseas relationship has been registered by a person who at the time mentioned in section 215(2) was domiciled in Scotland.</li>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2003-2004D001P4I0119">Image</span>
<li>The two people concerned are not to be treated as having formed a civil partnership if, at the time mentioned in section 215(2), they were not eligible by virtue of paragraph (b), (c) or (e) of section 86(1) to register in Scotland as civil partners of each other.</li>
<li>Subsection (6) applies if an overseas relationship has been registered by a person who at the time mentioned in section 215(2) was domiciled in Northern Ireland.</li>
<li>The two people concerned are not to be treated as having formed a civil partnership if, at the time mentioned in section 215(2)â€”</li>

</ol></ol></p>
<p><b>218 The public policy exception</b></p>
<p>Two people are not to be treated as having formed a civil partnership as a result of having entered into an overseas relationship if it would be manifestly contrary to public policy to recognise the capacity, under the relevant law, of one or both of them to enter into the relationship.</p>

<li>Subject to subsections (3) and (4), the validity of a dissolution or annulment of a civil partnership or a legal separation of civil partners which has been obtained from a court of civil jurisdiction in one part of the United Kingdom is to be recognised throughout the United Kingdom.</li>
<li>Recognition of the validity of a dissolution, annulment or legal separation 5 obtained from a court of civil jurisdiction in one part of the United Kingdom may be refused in any other part if the dissolution, annulment or separation was obtained at a time when it was irreconcilable with a decision determining the question of the subsistence or validity of the civil partnershipâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>previously given by a court of civil jurisdiction in the other part, or</li>
<li>previously given by a court elsewhere and recognised or entitled to be recognised in the other part.</li>

</ol></p>
<p><b>234 Recognition in the UK of overseas dissolution, annulment or separation</b>
<ol>
<li>Subject to subsection (2), the validity of an overseas dissolution, annulment or legal separation is to be recognised in the United Kingdom if, and only if, it is entitled to recognition by virtue of sections 235 to 237.</li>
<li>This section and sections 235 to 237 do not apply to an overseas dissolution, annulment or legal separation as regards which provision as to recognition is made by section 219 regulations.</li>
<li>For the purposes of subsections (1) and (2) and sections 235 to 237, an overseas dissolution, annulment or legal separation is a dissolution or annulment of a civil partnership or a legal separation of civil partners which has been obtained outside the United Kingdom.</li>
</ol></p>
<p><b>235 Grounds for recognition</b>
<ol>
<li>The validity of an overseas dissolution, annulment or legal separation obtained by means of proceedings is to be recognised ifâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>the dissolution, annulment or legal separation is effective under the law of the country in which it was obtained, and</li>
<li>at the relevant date either civil partnerâ€”</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>was habitually resident in the country in which the dissolution, annulment or legal separation was obtained,</li>
<li>was domiciled in that country, or</li>
<li>was a national of that country.</li>
</ol>
<li>The validity of an overseas dissolution, annulment or legal separation obtained otherwise than by means of proceedings is to be recognised ifâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>the dissolution, annulment or legal separation is effective under the law of the country in which it was obtained,</li>
<li>at the relevant dateâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>each civil partner was domiciled in that country, or</li>
<li>either civil partner was domiciled in that country and the other was domiciled in a country under whose law the dissolution, annulment or legal separation is recognised as valid, and</li>
</ol>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2003-2004D001P4I0127">Image</span>
<li>neither civil partner was habitually resident in the United Kingdom throughout the period of 1 year immediately preceding that date.</li>
</ol>
<li>In this section "the relevant date" meansâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>in the case of an overseas dissolution, annulment or legal separation obtained by means of proceedings, the date of the commencement of the proceedings;</li>
<li>in the case of an overseas dissolution, annulment or legal separation obtained otherwise than by means of proceedings, the date on which it was obtained.</li>
</ol>
<li>Where in the case of an overseas annulment the relevant date fell after the death of either civil partner, any reference in subsection (1) or (2) to that date is to be read in relation to that civil partner as a reference to the date of death.</li>
</ol></p>
<p><b>236 Refusal of recognition</b>
<ol>
<li>Recognition of the validity of an overseas dissolution, annulment or legal separation may be refused in any part of the United Kingdom if the dissolution, annulment or separation was obtained at a time when it was irreconcilable with a decision determining the question of the subsistence or validity of the civil partnershipâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>previously given by a court of civil jurisdiction in that part of the United Kingdom, or</li>
<li>previously given by a court elsewhere and recognised or entitled to be recognised in that part of the United Kingdom.</li>

<li>Recognition of the validity of an overseas dissolution or legal separation may be refused in any part of the United Kingdom if the dissolution or separation was obtained at a time when, according to the law of that part of the United Kingdom, there was no subsisting civil partnership.</li>
<li>Recognition of the validity of an overseas dissolution, annulment or legal separation may be refused ifâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>in the case of a dissolution, annulment or legal separation obtained by means of proceedings, it was obtainedâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>without such steps having been taken for giving notice of the proceedings to a civil partner as, having regard to the nature of the proceedings and all the circumstances, should reasonably have been taken, or</li>
<li>without a civil partner having been given (for any reason other than lack of notice) such opportunity to take part in the proceedings as, having regard to those matters, he should reasonably have been given, or</li>
</ol>
<li>in the case of a dissolution, annulment or legal separation obtained otherwise than by means of proceedingsâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>there is no official document certifying that the dissolution, annulment or legal separation is effective under the law of the country in which it was obtained, or</li>
<li>where either civil partner was domiciled in another country at the relevant date, there is no official document certifying that the dissolution, annulment or legal separation is recognised as valid under the law of that other country, or</li>
</ol>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2003-2004D001P4I0128">Image</span>

</ol>
<li>with respect to recognition of the validity of an overseas dissolution, annulment or legal separation in cases where there are cross-proceedings;</li>

<li>with respect to proof of findings of fact made in proceedings in any country or territory outside the United Kingdom.</li>
</ol>
<li>The power to make regulations under subsection (2) is exercisable by statutory instrument.</li>
<li>A statutory instrument containing such regulationsâ€”</li>
<ol>
<li>if made by the Lord Chancellor, is subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament;</li>
<li>if made by the Scottish Ministers, is subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of the Scottish Parliament.</li>
</ol>
<li>In this section (except subsection (4)) and sections 233 to 236 and 238â€”</li>
<ul>
<li>"annulment" includes any order annulling a civil partnership, however expressed;</li>
<li>"part of the United Kingdom" means England and Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland;</li>
