<p><span class='member'>The Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture (Mr. George Brown)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 10, line 29, at the end, to insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"(3) Any order under this section shall provide for the repayment by the Minister to the local authority of any expenses incurred by them in the performance of functions delegated by the order so far as those expenses are not otherwise recoverable under this Act."</p></blockquote>
This is a very simple point. It is a necessary part of the Bill which was left out in another place because a matter of privilege might arise.</span></p>

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
—(CONTROL OF METHODS OF TREATMENT OF INFESTATION.)</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. G. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 10, line 40, to leave out from "for," to "which," and to insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"keeping down or destroying rats, mice, insects or mites."</p></blockquote>
This Amendment is concerned with the next Amendment, in page 10, line 44. Both are consequential and follow Amendments made in another place seeking to define the word "infestation" much more precisely, or to remove it. We did, in fact, remove it from Part I and put in a different definition, and that makes it necessary to define the word "infestation" more precisely in Part II. These Amendments will have that effect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Major Sir Thomas Dugdale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a little more in it than that, and I should like a further explanation. It would now appear that under Clause 19, which is in Part III of the Bill, we are bringing in Part I. For the first time we are introducing into the Clause words dealing with rats and mice. As the Clause is-drafted and according to its title, it deals
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 496</span>
only with infestation, and now we are bringing in rats, mice, insects and mites, which is the concern of Parts I and II. Whether there is anything behind that I do not know, but I think we ought to have an explanation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. G. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think there is any point in the hon. and gallant Member's argument. We are seeking quite clearly to define the methods of control for the purposes of this Part of the Bill, and the word "infestation" is defined in Clause 27 on page 14 of the Bill as meaning
<br><blockquote><p>"the presence of rats, mice, insects or mites."</p></blockquote>
If we were to leave the word "infestation" in Clause 19, it would still cover rats and mice, and the reason why we have done this is because this Clause deals with private contractors who might be operating methods of clearing infestation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Turton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not at all clear about this, and less clear after the last speech of the Joint Parliamentary Secretary. This concerns not Part II of the Bill but Part III, and as the Bill is drafted and has been explained to us it would mean that a private contractor, keeping down rats and mice under the provisions of Part III and under contract with and supervision by a local authority, would suddenly find that he was subject to regulations made by the Minister of Agriculture which might be quite contrary to the directions of the local authority. I am sure that that is a position which the Joint Parliamentary Secretary would not desire. This concerns not Part II, as he has said twice, but Part III of the Bill, which governs this procedure.<br><br>
If I might deal with the other point he raised, it really means nothing, because "infestation" is defined in Clause 27 as including the presence of rats, mice, insects and mites. Perhaps that is a slip on the part of the Government, which I hope will be rectified. It seems that the definition of "infestation" should now be altered to exclude rats and mice. As I understand the position at present, rats and mice are dealt with only under Part I, and the infestation of food is dealt with under Part II which is the responsibility of the Ministry and not of the local authorities; or is it to be the case that they are also concerned with Part II and should have control over rats and mice?
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1948-1949V003P0I0258">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 497</span>
All our discussions on Tuesday were based on the assumption that Part II deals with the infestation of food and is not concerned with contamination by rats and mice. If the Minister is going to open out the position again, there appears to be an even greater duplication in this Bill. I hope that the matter will receive further attention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. G. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With great respect, I think that the hon. Member is making very heavy weather of this. This is purely a drafting Amendment to bring Part III into line with Amendments made at various other stages to meet points of view urged upon us by, among others, Members on the other side, both here and in another place. What we are now doing is to bring the definition in this Part of the Bill into line with what we have done elsewhere.<br><br>
I seem to have misled the hon. Member by referring to Part II, and it is quite true that we are on Part III of the Bill. The question of control by contractors arises on Part II and not on Part I, but we are now making provision for control under Part III. We are removing the word "infestation" from Part I, but it remains in Part II of the Bill. We are dealing with methods of control of private contractors, which cannot arise under Part I in the sense that Part II of the Bill deals with food premises or any premises which are concerned under the provisions of Part I dealing with loss or damage to food. We are now dealing with an entirely separate part of the Bill. I will certainly look at the matter again to make sure that we are not putting anything across anybody, but I am quite certain I am right and that all we are doing is to remove rather vague and wide terms like this and put in something much more specific. By dropping out these words and inserting the words,
<br><blockquote><p>"keeping down or destroying, rats, mice, insects or mites,"</p></blockquote>
we are stating much more specifically what we want to be done. In the second Amendment, we are simplifying the matter very considerably as the result of what we have done elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir T. Dugdale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the assurance that the Joint Parliamentary Secretary will look at the matter again, I think that he has met our point at this stage. We understand the purpose of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 498</span>
Amendment is to get rid of the loose word "infestation" which we do not like. It has been removed from earlier parts of the Bill, and these Amendments are made to complete the deletion. If that is the sole purpose of the Amendment it will meet our point. We are grateful to the Joint Parliamentary Secretary for his promise to look at it again and to make quite certain that it does not have a much more far-reaching effect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Turton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before we take the step which has been suggested by my hon. and gallant Friend, will the Joint Parliamentary Secretary correct his statement that Part I of the Bill deals with damage to food? It does nothing of the kind; it talks about keeping down rats and mice. Because he is using similar words to those in Part I, if he does not alter this Clause, he will make it appear that these provisions concern Part I and not Part II.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. G. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think so, but I will look at the point again.</span></p>
<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
<p>Amendment made: In page 10, line 44, leave out from "approve," to "in," in line 46, and insert "different methods for use."—[<i>Mr. G. Brown</i>.]</p>
<p>Motion made, and Question proposed, "That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill."</p>
<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir T. Dugdale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Subsection (2) states that for a first offence a person shall be liable to a fine not exceeding £100, and that for any subsequent offence he shall be liable to a fine of £200. Those are very large fines. It may be right and proper that they should be large for the particular offences envisaged in the Clause. However, may we have an indication of the Government's intention here? For what kind of offence exactly, is it expected one should have to pay a fine of £100? It is unusual to have so large a fine for a first offence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. G. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are taking powers under the Clause to control the methods of dealing with infestation. Unless this is done, people who want to keep their premises aright may pay considerable sums of money to charlatans who cannot really do the job. We want the job to be done properly, and we are taking
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1948-1949V003P0I0259">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 499</span>
steps to make available the scientific knowledge that there is about it, and to make regulations for telling people about these scientific means to overcome infestation. Therefore, in subsection (1, <i>b</i>) we want to prohibit the use of any method other than modern scientific methods. Refusal to abide by this proposal may mean that the whole of an operation may fall to the ground, and even encourage rather than discourage pests. Heavy and disproportionate costs would then fall on the ratepayers. To prevent that, and to mark the importance of this work, and of its being rightly done, we think we ought to have penalties for failing to comply with the regulations, and penalties of a considerable size.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orr-Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These penalties are very perturbing indeed. It means that someone who used chemicals not approved by the Ministry might be liable to a fine. There could even be disputes as to whether the ingredients of poisonous compounds were those stipulated by the Ministry. A small departure from a Ministerial specification for some poisonous compound might make a man liable to a heavy fine. To implement this proposal, I cannot see how the Minister can avoid issuing an official list of approved poisons—and approved machines as well—if he is to penalise those who do something of which he does not approve. It is not a happy idea that the Ministry should be responsible for putting a firm out of business that makes certain compounds which do not happen to be approved officially. I am not suggesting that the Minister wants to do that—I do not suppose he does. However, that would seem to be one of the inevitable consequences of the course he is pursuing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. G. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to do that, nor do I think it will happen. I would remind the hon. Member of what he has himself said. Here we are dealing with people who make all sorts of dangerous compounds, and people who may leave them about, hoping that rats may be the first to eat them, before, say, a dog. That sort of thing might endanger valuable farm animals, and even children. It would be nonsense were the Government to abdicate their responsibility and allow contractors to lay any compounds
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 500</span>
anywhere they liked, irrespective of whether those particular poisons were the most suitable means for dealing with the pests in the particular circumstances in which they were used.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orr-Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely the hon. Member is going a little bit too far in saying that. I know he does not want to interfere with those who sell these compounds. If anyone leaves poison about which is dangerous to human beings or livestock, and any harm results, there is a remedy against him. Here, however, the Minister suggests going a good deal further than that. I do ask him to consider the point carefully. If this subsection really means what it says, I am convinced that the hon. Member cannot escape issuing an official list of approved compounds, a list of all those things he insists ought to be used.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be that that will be done, since scientific research is going on into this matter. I had not thought about it, but it may be that that will be done, because certain things will be considered by scientists to be the best to be used. I was not being unfair to anybody. We need to have penalties of this size to mark the seriousness of this sort of offence, but it does not follow that the magistrates will impose the maximum fine. They will do what they think is right in the particular circumstances of each case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Brigadier Peto</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What right of appeal has a man against a fine of £100 for the first offence?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He can appeal to the higher court—to quarter sessions.</span></p>

<p>Motion made, and Question proposed, "That the Clause stand part of the Bill."</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir T. Dugdale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will remember that we had a long discussion during our last meeting on Clause 12, and that it revolved to a considerable extent on the interpretation of the wording of this Clause. We were told by the Minister that there were no powers to give general directions under Clause 12 unless they
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1948-1949V003P0I0260">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 501</span>
came before Parliament. Our discussion showed a difference of view in the Committee as to what would happen so far as specific powers were concerned. I want to ask the Joint Parliamentary Secretary to look at this question again before the Report stage, to see if in any way he can devise an Amendment to meet the point we raised in the long Debate we had. I ask him to do that for the sake of the future administration of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. G. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think there is any doubt about it, and that it is quite clear. What my right hon. Friend said is quite clear. To my clear recollection he said at least three times that he referred specifically to general directions, and that it is to general directions Clause 12 refers. It is not my right hon. Friend's intention to approve specific directions under this Clause. One is always prepared to think about a matter, and that is what the hon. and gallant Member for Richmond (Sir T. Dugdale) has asked us to do, but I cannot hold out any hope that in this case we shall come down on the side of the fence he would like. I do not think that we can make this clearer, and my right hon. Friend was clear in what he said the other day.</span></p>

<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
—(POWERS OF ENTRY.)</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. G. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 12, line 3, at the end, to insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that where a person is authorised as aforesaid to enter upon any land belonging to a railway undertaking he shall, in exercising his powers under this subsection, comply with any reasonable requirements of the British Transport Commission or other persons carrying on the undertaking for preventing interference with railway traffic."</p></blockquote>
This proviso makes certain that we shall not have difficulties arising through some inspector, appointed in connection with this work by a local authority, nominating his own time for entering upon railway lines or tunnels, and so on, and perhaps affecting traffic operations. The whole intention is to make it clear that we want here, as throughout, proper and reasonable relationships between the authorities concerned. This proviso does not apply, for the purposes of Part II, to our inspectors at the goods terminal stations, because there it will be possible
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 502</span>
to make arrangements in the ordinary way of administration. The danger of difficulty is more likely to arise under Part I.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Turton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not quite understand why one only of the nationalised undertakings should be given this special treatment, while other nationalised undertakings and the remnants of private enterprise are not. After all, railways are not the only places where we do not want interference with business. I should have thought that shipping might also have had this treatment. What about the docks? Are they to be interfered with by the unreasonable action of officials? The business of grain storage comes in. I think that this Amendment is unnecessary. I think the good sense of the officials who are appointed by the local authorities, or by pest destruction companies, will serve to save interference with the railways, or with shipping, or with electricity works, or with grain storage, for the officials will recognise that these are nationally important undertakings, and they will try to work in cooperation with those running them. There is danger in selecting one case only and putting it into the Bill. We must remember the maxim, <i>inclusio unius est exclusio alterius</i>.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orr-Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Subsection (6) of this Clause provides that damages are recoverable for any harm done to premises in the exercise of the power of entry conferred by this Clause. As my hon. Friend the Member for Thirsk and Malton (Mr. Turton) has pointed out, there are other undertakings as well as railways which can be entered upon, and buildings as well as land, and I should have thought that they ought to have been protected in more or less the same way as the railways are to be. It is not very wise to instance one nationalised or un-nationalised undertaking. It does not matter very much for this purpose whether the undertaking is nationalised or not. To say that one lot of people are not to be damaged or interfered with does not seem sense.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Brigadier Peto</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I faced a similar difficuty in connection with a Private Member's Bill in which I am interested, and in which I used the term "at any reasonable time." The question was whether
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1948-1949V003P0I0261">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 503</span>
it was reasonable for the person inspecting or for the person being inspected. We had to put in a provision about ordinary trading hours—or some expression of that kind, so that a man would not be knocked up after he had gone to bed—although that may be the time for catching cats.</span></p>
<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. G. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We think we have provided for reasonable times throughout the Bill, and that we have provided for the most harmonious working of the thing. With regard to the other points raised by the hon. Member for Thirsk and Malton (Mr. Turton), the answer to the question why we have applied it to the railways and not shipping is that we have specifically reserved shipping from the Bill unless brought in by Order in Council. We do not think it necessary specifically to reserve shipping, but we are convinced that there is a special safety factor in the case of railways. No one wishes to put the railways or the Transport Commission into a different category, but there is this safety factor—the question of embankments and tunnels. The protection provided here is merely addressed to that, so that in an excess of zeal some inspector does not hamper the safety of the railways and the people travelling on them.<br><br>
I was not quite clear about the hon. Gentleman's point on the definition of "land," but I think it is covered by the definition in Clause 27, which says it
<br><blockquote><p>"includes land covered with water, and any building or part of a building."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Captain Crookshank</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What about the National Coal Board properties? Surely the safety factor comes in there. I think the hon. Gentleman had better have a look again at this. I see no miners' Members here, but I think they would agree that safety is vital also in the mines.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. G. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think the risk of inspectors of local authorities does not arise in the same way in that case, but the right hon. and gallant Gentleman has put a point which I shall be happy to look into.</span></p>
<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 504</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orr-Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 12, line 19, at the end, to insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"(3) If it is shown to the satisfaction of a justice of the peace on sworn information in writing—
<ol>
<li>hat admission to any premises has been refused, or that refusal is apprehended, or that the premises are unoccupied or the occupier is temporarily absent, or that the case is one of urgency, or that an application for admission would defeat the object of the entry; and</li>
<li>that there is reasonable ground for entry into the premises for any such purpose as aforesaid,</li></ol>
the justice may by warrant under his hand authorise a person duly authorised by the Minister or by the local authority to enter the premises, if need be by force:</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Provided that such a warrant shall not be issued unless the justice is satisfied either that notice of the intention to apply for a warrant has been given to the occupier, or that the premises are unoccupied or that the occupier is temporarily absent or that the case is one of urgency, or that the giving of such notice would defeat the object of the entry.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>
(4) An authorised officer entering any premises by virtue of this section, or of a warrant issued thereunder, may take with him such other persons as may be necessary, and on leaving any unoccupied premises which he has entered by virtue of such warrant shall leave them as effectively secured against trespassers as he found them.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(5) Every warrant granted under this section shall continue in force for a period of one month."</p></blockquote>
The intention here is perfectly simple, I believe that the Amendment is really necessary if we are to be fair to the occupier. It will also prevent any of the Minister's employees getting into any serious trouble under the powers of this Clause. The object of the Amendment is to make it necessary to get a magistrate's warrant to enable an officer appointed by the local authority to enter a building where the owner has refused entry, or is away, or where the building is unoccupied. There is a precedent in Section 287 of the Public Health Act, 1936, which I think provides all the background necessary in the historical sense.<br><br>
The strongest point in favour of this Amendment is that it will safeguard any individual carrying out these duties if he were on unoccupied premises. If he were found without a magistrate's warrant on unoccupied premises he might find himself in an embarrassing position. I do not think the proposal of this Amendment adds to the length of time taken up in getting entry. After all, a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1948-1949V003P0I0262">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 505</span>
man who refuses entry knows that he is subject to prosecution if he does so, but I think it would make it even clearer to him that he was taking a serious step in refusing entry if the individual came back with a definite warrant after the first refusal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Captain Crookshank</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend elaborate one point? His Amendment states:
<br><blockquote><p><div class='sup'><span class='label label-warning'>sup</span>
*</div> <!-- sup --> the occupier is temporarily absent, or that the case is one of urgency, or that an application for admission would defeat the object of the entry,"</p></blockquote>
I know what it means in other circumstances, but we are dealing with rats and mice, and I am afraid it is not good phraseology. Does he mean that on an application for admission a man who had rats and mice would put them away temporarily and produce them afterwards?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orr-Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think the real purpose of these words is this: supposing a man was carrying on some improper practice by using the wrong poison or machines. He might be acting dangerously, and might make a habit of these things. If he were given a warning he would not be caught "rat-handed." Perhaps it is going rather too far, but as a general safeguard it might be considered wise to have it in the Clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. G. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not quite clear whether in the final part of the hon. Member's remarks he was undertaking to think again on his Amendment between now and the Report stage. I am not anxious, if the Committee wants this to go in, to urge very strongly that it should not go in, but on the other hand we felt that the powers contained in this Amendment which, as the hon. Gentleman pointed out, are in the Public Health Act, 1936, are rather drastic. We did not include them deliberately for that reason—it seems rather drastic on the occupier.<br><br>
At the moment, Clause 22 (2) gives the power for the person duly authorised in writing to have entry; subsection (3) sets down the conditions of entry, and subsection (4) provides penalties. We are quite prepared to rely on those subsections. That will mean that the thing will work, and that anyone getting awkward can be proceeded against. If the Opposition want to persist in this right of people to go into other peoples' property,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 506</span>
I am prepared to accept the Amendment, but I think that we might leave the matter where it is.</span></p>

<br><blockquote><p>"other than a local authority."</p></blockquote>
I want to make it quite clear that I personally do not see any need whatsoever for this Amendment. At the same time, in mitigation, may I plead that strong representations have been made to me by an association of bodies representing local authorities, as a result of which I am convinced that there are individual officers of these local authorities tinder the impression that they will become liable if any individual employed by a local authority does something wrong? Personally, I do not see how individual officers can be held liable. I think they are protected in the ordinary way, but I think it would be wrong for the Amendment to be read to mean that a local authority is above the law. That would be a horrible picture. They should be more within the law than anyone else. I hope it will not be thought that I am trying to contract local authorities out of the law altogether, but as these representations have been made I am bringing them to the notice of the Minister so that he can give some explanation.</span></p>

This Amendment is either unnecessary or undesirable, and as the representations that have been made to the hon. Gentleman have not been made to me I am not sure which of those two things applies. If the intention is to take from local authorities the possibility of prosecution because they fail in their functions it is undesirable; if the intention is to prevent individual officers of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 508</span>
local authorities being prosecuted it is unnecessary. If we prosecute a local authority, they would be prosecuted as such, and notice would be served, as usual, on the town clerk, the chief officer. The only purpose of this is to make sure that individual directors of a company, a corporate body, can be got at, otherwise the thing might be nullified, as we know happens in other directions.

—(INTERPRETATION.)</div> <!-- title -->
<p>Motion made, and Question proposed, "That the Clause stand part of the Bill."</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Turton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister reconsider the definition of "infestation" between now and the Report stage? I do not ask for anything more. It appears to me that if it is left including rats and mice, under Part II an owner of food premises will have to give notice to the Minister, the Minister will then have to notify the local authority, while the owner of the food premises will also have to give notice to the local authority under Part I. The change that has come about is, I think, due to the fact that in another place they altered the Bill and took the word "infestation" out of Part I. The Bill itself alters the present position in that it no longer gives the county pest officer powers of enforcement; he merely has administrative powers for dealing with rats and mice. When the county pest officer had enforcement powers it was right that notice of infestation, as under the infestation order, should be given to the enforcement authority, the county pest committee. That will no longer be the case.<br><br>
As I see it, there is here that very duplication of which I have always been frightened under this Bill. I was not sufficiently aware of this definition when we were arguing Part II, and I quite agree that I ought more properly to have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1948-1949V003P0I0264">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 509</span>
raised this question by means of an Amendment to Part II. I think it is something we must consider, because I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary no less than we on this side wants to avoid duplication. Under Part II the only Ministry officials who could deal effectively with rats and mice from the enforcement point of view would, I imagine, be the headquarters staff of the Ministry. While I have no criticism to level at that headquarters staff, I think it would be highly inconvenient if they had to take enforcement action from the headquarters right down to the area of the local authority, instead of allowing the local authority to act as they are empowered to do under this Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir T. Dugdale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to support my hon. Friend in the hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will look at this again before the Report stage. I have here a copy of the Bill as drafted when first introduced in another place. Of course, the present definition is a great improvement on the original, but because the changes have been made I think this wants looking at again. I believe I am right in saying that the word "infestation" does not appear in Part I. If it does not appear in Part I, surely the reference to rats and mice ought to be omitted from Clause 27. All I ask is that the Parliamentary Secretary will have another look at it to see if we can get it tidied up so that we can all agree on the definition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. G. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will certainly look at it again. As we go through a Bill, making Amendments, we want to be quite sure that we do not introduce anything unnecessary. I do not think there is much in this point. On the question of duplication, the hon. Member for Thirsk and Malton (Mr. Turton) will remember Clause 3 (3), which says:
<br><blockquote><p>"A person shall not be required to give notice under this section to the local authority on any matters of which notice is given to the Minister in pursuance of Part II of this Act."</p></blockquote>
We therefore clearly provide that he shall not have to give notice backwards and forwards, so that we have covered ourselves against duplication.<br><br>
On the other hand, thinking aloud in response to the hon. and gallant Member for Richmond (Sir T. Dugdale), I think considerable dangers will arise
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 510</span>
from limiting the definition of "infestation "for Part II. After all, we there deal not so much with premises as with the infestation and the risk of danger to food. If we exclude rats and mice we would have to get something done about the infestation of a particular lot of food; there may be rats and mice, and we may be under some difficulty if insects and mites were not the real cause of trouble. I think it is right to keep the definition of "infestation" wide, even though in the main we shall be getting at insects and mites. However, as there are clearly difficulties we will certainly look at it again to make sure that it is clear.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Captain Crookshank</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the Parliamentary Secretary moves the Second Reading of this new Clause, may I raise a point of Order with you, Mr. Lang? In doing so let me make it quite clear that there is no objection on my part to compensation being paid to displaced officers. I should like to know whether this new Clause does not require some form of Money Resolution. It must do one of two things. It must either impose a charge on the rates, because it says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Minister shall by regulations provide for the payment of compensation,"</p></blockquote>
which seems to me to require a Money Resolution in some form or another; or alternatively the Minister intends to pay himself, and is merely passing on the actual method of doing it by regulation upon the local authorities. If that is the intention, or indeed if the intention is to go half and half with the local authority, it should be covered by a Money Resolution. As I look at the Money Resolution to which you called our attention at the First Sitting, I can see nothing which empowers the Minister to make any grant towards any compensation payments. That being so, I put it to you, with very great regret, that we cannot discuss this now until we have asked the House for a further financial authority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. and gallant Gentleman has raised a very interesting and important point. The Committee are considering this new Clause without any knowledge, at the moment, as to which part of the Bill it will go in. If it goes into Part I, any payment is expressly authorised by the Money Resolution; if it goes into Part II, there can be no question of any payment being involved. It therefore seems to me that the point does not arise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Captain Crookshank</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With all due respect, while I deprecate arguing with the Chair, if that be the view of the Chair it seems to me to be a very strange interpretation of a Money Resolution, because the Money Resolution to a Bill when presented to Parliament must be read in conjunction with the Bill as presented. Therefore, the House gives authority to Government for introducing financial provisions into a Bill. When it says that the provisions in Part I will attract
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 512</span>
a grant it can only have in mind the Part I which at that time is before it. I should be very surprised if there were any precedents by which, after the House had decided the scope of the financial provisions of a Bill—that is to say, that money should be provided for Part I as Part I then stood—any Standing Committee then passed new Clauses which involved payment out of the Exchequer, leaving it apparently to the Minister or the draftsman, or whoever it may be, to put those new Clauses into Part I, thereby attracting the provisions for which Parliament had provided in Part I of the Bill as presented. With all deference, I submit that would be very improper.<br><br>
I quite agree that under the wording of the Money Resolution there is authority for any of the functions in Part I to be covered; but this is not in Part I; we do not know that it will be in Part I, and we do not know who will decide whether it should go into Part I. It does not say in the new Clause, "This shall he in Part I, and will therefore attract a grant." I respectfully submit that it would be out of Order to discuss this new Clause now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Turton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I add a further consideration, with great respect, on what you have said on this point of Order. You suggested that the new Clause might be in either Part I or Part II. Is it not more likely that it would be in Part III, which is headed "Supplemental," rather than in Part II which is headed "Infestation of Food," or Part I, which is headed "Rats and Mice"? I should have thought that the compensation to officers would come under "Supplemental." If it is in Part III it will cover both Part I and Part II and yet will not be specifically alluded to under Clause 11; thereby it would lay a charge on the Exchequer, as my right hon. and gallant Friend pointed out, and I submit that it would be out of Order. I am in favour of this new Clause, and I only wish that it had been presented in a more orderly form, but with great respect to you I would argue that unless it is specifically stated that it comes under Part II it is really out of Order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The points raised by the right hon. and gallant Gentleman and the hon. Member have been considered. The question put by the hon. Member
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1948-1949V003P0I0266">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 513</span>
for Thirsk and Malton (Mr. Turton) is, I think, covered by the Exchequer Equalisation Grant and therefore does not arise. I think the right hon. and gallant Gentleman misunderstood me, and I am sorry if I contributed to that misunderstanding. I did not suggest that there was any reference to Part I in the new Clause. The reference in the Money Resolution is obviously for the purposes of any Act, and it seems to me that the matter is covered.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Captain Crookshank</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but I do not quite take that point, because the Money Resolution does authorise the payment of
<br><blockquote><p>"any sums required by the Minister …for making to local authorities …grants equal to one half of the expenditure incurred by those authorities under Part I of the said Act."</p></blockquote>
I may have misunderstood you, but I thought you said that if this Clause were put into Part I it would automatically attract the 50 per cent. grant under that financial provision. I was endeavouring to point out that it is not within the power of this Committee, or as far as I know of anybody else at the moment, to say that a particular new Clause shall be put into Part I, and thereby attract the 50 per cent. grant. My argument was that the 50 per cent. grant under Part I can only cover the actual Clauses in Part I of the Bill as presented on Second Reading.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged to the right hon. and gallant Gentleman, but I can only say that the Money Resolution refers not to the Bill, but to "any Act." Therefore it seems to me that it covers what is to be done, and quite clearly if it goes into Part I it is covered there.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Captain Crookshank</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, with all due respect, that is an enlargement of the views of financial provisions, if I may respectfully say so, if under that Ruling it covered any Act, and if by that you mean any Clauses put into the Bill before it becomes the Act. Surely what is discussed in Committee is governed by the Money Resolution, and, irrespective of how it may turn out at the end of the day, we can only discuss Clauses and provisions which are governed by the Money Resolution accepted by the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not very clear on this. Are we not running into the very danger that is foreseen? County councils,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 514</span>
who in the main are the bodies who will have to pay compensation, are not bodies eligible for grant aid. The charge will fall on the county councils and on the general rate fund. If there were any bodies likely to attract additional grant under the Exchequer Equalisation Grant, it seems to me, with great respect, that they are covered under paragraph (c). The county councils will not attract grant aid, and therefore there will not be any payment to them from the central fund. I should have thought the point did not really arise.</span></p>
<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It seems to me that, wherever this Clause goes, it is covered. If it is in Part I it is covered by express authorisation, and if it is Part III county councils are concerned and there will be no charge on the Exchequer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Captain Crookshank</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to take a contrary view, but may I leave the point now in the belief that you will not take it amiss if I take it up again on Report stage with Mr. Speaker, because I do not think that it is the normal procedure of the House? The blame, if there is blame, rests with the Government for not having foreseen this and put it into the Money Resolution to make it clear beyond peradventure. I am much obliged to you, Mr. Lang, for your Rulings. I would be the last to question your authority, but I reserve my position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. and gallant Gentleman will exercise all the powers to which he is entitled.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. G. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."<br><br>
This new Clause arises out of the discussion on Second Reading when an assurance was given by my right hon. Friend. It is customary to provide for compensation for loss of office or diminution of emoluments when statutory functions hitherto administered by one group of local authorities are transferred to another group. Most county councils have already delegated their powers and duties under the 1919 Act to borough or district councils, and we do not think that a significant number of officers employed by county councils will be affected by subsection (1, <i>a</i>). On the other hand,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1948-1949V003P0I0267">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 515</span>
it is a matter of principle to which representative organisations concerned attach a great deal of importance, and we think it right to make this provision.<br><br>
The first part of the new Clause provides that compensation shall be payable by the county council from which functions are transferred rather than by local authorities to which they are transferred. We think that this is right because it would be very difficult and probably completely impossible to apportion the cost of any compensation payable among several local authorities to whom functions will be transferred by any one county council. The second difficulty of apportioning among several authorities is the fact that the county councils will be generally losing their duties and, therefore, losing the expenditure. I understand that the county councils are quite happy with this provision, which is much more simple and more equitable.<br><br>
The second part of subsection (1) provides that where any local authority is in default in the exercise of its powers under Part I of the Bill and the Minister intervenes to get the functions exercised by some other person, the regulations to be made by the Minister shall provide that the local authority shall pay compensation for loss of office or diminution of emoluments to any of its employees affected. This is intended to prevent hardship to employees who, through no fault of their own, suffer loss because the local authority employing them has been negligent in the discharge of its duties under the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Turton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One point is worrying me to which I should like the Joint Parliamentary Secretary to give attention. The difficulty in this case is that the transfer from the county councils to district councils is not taking place after the Bill is passed, but took place under an order made in 1942. As that transfer came by reason of an order, presumably these officers did not benefit from any compensation provisions. Whilst this proposed new Clause looks very nice at first sight, broadly speaking it means nothing. I am not speaking of subsection (2), because I do not know how many local authorities the Minister will dispossess in due course, but what I object to are the limiting words:
<br><blockquote><p>"persons who, immediately before the commencement of this Act."</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 516</span>
What we are doing here is to give statutory authority to a war-time order. I know that these officers who were city council rodent control officers have suffered a considerable loss of status, and in many cases of emolument, I believe, by the decentralisation which took place during the war. I think it only right that we should deal justly with these officers in cases where that change in status took place by reason of an order. I know that the Joint Parliamentary Secretary is anxious to meet the point put by the hon. Member for the Park Division of Sheffield (Mr. Burden) on Second Reading. I do not believe the Clause would do full justice to the officers involved. I hope he will look at the matter again to see if he can broaden it so as to deal with officers who suffered loss by change of employment as a result of the order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. G. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I understand the position, the previous decentralisation was not by virtue of the order of 1943, but was a voluntary arrangement arising out of the powers of the 1919 Act, which enabled county councils to delegate to minor local authorities who were prepared to accept the delegation. Whereas 1,200 local authorities received delegated duties, 145 did not, and therefore some county councils have not yet delegated and have a small number of staff who are concerned. Under this Measure we could not make the provision cover all who, by voluntary arrangement arising out of the 1919 Act, delegated their powers. To make compensation payable under this Measure to cover all the Acts of the past 30 years would be outside the provisions we have before us and would be improper here.</span></p>

This takes the place of the Clause which appears in square brackets as Clause 11. That was left out of the Bill for reasons of privilege. In line 37, after "authorities," the words,
<br><blockquote><p>"out of moneys provided by Parliament,"</p></blockquote>
are dropped in view of this point being covered by Clause 26. In line 42, "recovered" is now substituted for "recoverable." It is considered by many local authorities that insistence on payment by householders except in cases of contributory negligence would prejudice seriously the co-operation which is essential to effective control. It is contemplated that the conditions to be attached to grant aid will allow the exercise of discretion by the local authorities as to whether they shall collect or waive the cost of extermination in the case of dwellings. If they decide against charging they will have to bear one half of the cost on their rate funds.<br><br>
On the other hand, it is necessary to insist on recovery in respect of service rendered to trading premises. In such cases the cost of destroying the animals is a proper charge to the trading working expenses. It is provided in those cases that there should be a charge, but in those cases we want to leave it to the discretion of the local authority. If this principle were broken down, the onus of responsibility would be moved from the owner or occupier to the local authority and the State.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Turton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."<br><br>
I wish to make it clear that this is quite a different point from that which I raised earlier on, when I asked for "Government Department" to be taken out of Clause 13 and the Minister said it would be quite wrong to compel a Minister to report to another Minister, and that it would be absurd for Ministers to have that degree of correspondence. Whether we agree that that attitude between the Minister of Food and the Minister of Agriculture is right, or wrong, or is disastrous, or not, that does not arise under this new Clause. We are dealing with a problem under Part I by which, under the Bill as at present, every occupier of land will have a duty to report to the local authority when there are too many rats and mice on his premises; but any Government Department would be free from that responsibility. I have put down the new Clause at the request of what I think most Members will agree is the most eminent of the local government associations, the County Councils' Association, who are concerned, from past experience of Government Departments, that Government Departments should be excluded. From knowledge of my constituency, I say that Government Departments have been very bad sinners in this respect.<br><br>
11.45 a.m.<br><br>
I can remember a house in my constituency being requisitioned at the beginning of the war, and it was then inhabited by an Army unit. From that time, the rats and mice population in the neighbourhood increased in a surprising fashion, and the position became much worse when the Army unit left. After 1945, that house was occupied by some Russians, who, I understand, had been fighting for Germany, and when the Russians left the rat population became worse still. We thought that that was the last stage—when the Russians were transported back to Russia, where I understand they did not survive very long. But the house was then occupied by Italian prisoners of war. After that, wherever one walked in the neighbourhood one saw nothing but rats, not only at night, but in the morning.<br><br>
That was a case of a Government Department. It was the War Department
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 520</span>
at first, and later it became the responsibility of the Ministry of Works. I know the kind of answer which the Joint Parliamentary Secretary, with all his dialectical skill, will introduce. He will say that he has somewhere in Whitehall a consultative committee which is examining this problem, and that the Government Departments concerned will notify the local authorities if there are rats and mice on their premises. When we think of all the camps in the country and the amount of garbage they produce, and also realise the enormous numbers of rats and mice resulting from that fact, surely it is not such a harsh proposal merely to suggest that a Government Department should be treated exactly like ordinary people and be compelled to notify the local authorities when conditions on their premises are not satisfactory?<br><br>
After all, Government Departments have great responsibilities, and we realise that they have to deal with a great deal of garbage on their own premises, but even so they should have the same responsibilities as are placed on other people. For these reasons, I hope the Joint Parliamentary Secretary will look over his brief again and produce some different argument to that of the Whitehall consultative committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. G. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman saw my brief he must have misread it, because there is no reference to a consultative committee anywhere in it. It is true, however, that I have a supplementary brief which does mention a consultative committee, but that deals with general principles and not with detailed cases, so that the hon. Gentleman is quite safe.<br><br>
The position is this. There are constitutional reasons why it would be quite improper, and indeed out of Order, to include this new Clause in the Bill. There are two classes of Crown property. There is the property which is owned by the Crown, but which is in the occupation of some private individual military unit or commercial undertaking. That class of Crown property is clearly covered, because there is provision in the Bill for dealing with the occupier and placing a duty upon the occupier to give notice and to carry out whatever instructions are given him. The duty clearly rests upon
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1948-1949V003P0I0270">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 521</span>
the occupier, and with that class of Crown property there is no difficulty.<br><br>
The only difficulty which does arise concerns the other class of Crown property, which is both owned and in the occupation of the Crown. It would obviously be impossible in the case of property which may be occupied by defence units to require that all property owned and used by the Crown for purposes of defence should be subject to this Clause, because some question of secrecy might be involved. It would be quite impossible to do that, and it would be very much against the national interests. Equally, we think it is constitutionally improper to require one Government Department to be subject to these conditions where it is using Crown property itself.<br><br>
We must assume that, in the light of the unhappy experience of the hon. Member opposite with his minor League of Nations, the Crown will act in this matter in all respects in accordance with the provisions of the Act and will do what it ought to do—what, in different circumstances, it would be required to do; in other words, what the occupiers of other premises will be required to do. There is no reason to think that the Crown will not act in that way, and it is the intention that that should be the case.<br><br>
From time to time, there will be individual cases like that mentioned by the hon. Gentleman. It seems to me that the protection in such cases lies in the fact that there are Members in this House who will be using such cases to draw attention to the matter, and the local authority concerned will be able to rely upon its Member of Parliament to raise the matter here and to call to account the responsible Minister, although we do not think there will be many cases where that will be necessary. Broadly speaking, concerning the class of property owned by the Crown and occupied by somebody else, the provisions of the Clause will apply, and, where the Crown is occupier as well as owner, it would be quite wrong and administratively impossible, in cases where questions of secrecy might arise, to provide that the provisions of this Clause should operate. We must assume that in such cases the Crown will act in accordance with the spirit and intentions of the Bill and will find means of carrying out the obligations which would otherwise be laid upon them.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 522</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. G. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As far as I can discover, the only real reason which the Joint Parliamentary Secretary has given against the new Clause is that, for purposes of defence, there might be a question of some secret weapon or something of that kind which would make it undesirable for the Clause to be applied. Otherwise, he told us that we must assume that Government Departments will do the right thing. His only reason against the Clause was the consideration of secrecy, and I admit that there may be something in that.<br><br>
As regards the assumption that Government Departments will do the right thing, that seems to me to be a totally inadequate reason, because my hon. Friend has mentioned a specific case, and no doubt other Members could produce similar cases. For my own part, I know of a case in which refuse was thrown all over the place within 25 yards of a private house, which suffered accordingly. It therefore seems quite absurd to pretend that Government Departments will do the right thing. It is quite wrong that Government Departments should be allowed to think that they are above the law, and I hope the hon. Gentleman will think again on this matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dye</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hardly think the example given by the hon. Member for Thirsk and Malton (Mr. Turton) is one which is likely to recur, at least as far as the Russians ate concerned. In our experience in the country districts, we have had great difficulties in dealing with military camps and airfields, where the authorities have not kept down their rats and mice which have been allowed to spread on to agricultural land. There have also been difficulties experienced by officials of county district councils in dealing with the Forestry Commission. It may be that the Forestry Commission may now prevent such things, but we have in my division a very large battle training area which has been a continual source of trouble to the whole neighbourhood with all kinds of pests. Great difficulties have been met in securing any real contact and co-operation with the authorities in endeavouring to cope with these pests.<br><br>
If some Clause such as this could be inserted in the Bill, it would establish beyond all question that these authorities are subject to exactly the same laws as other occupiers of land. This would help
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1948-1949V003P0I0271">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 523</span>
the people who will have to administer the Act, because they will not want to deal with people who can say to them, "We are above this particular law; we are officers of the Crown, and you cannot touch us." We want to secure full cooperation with the local authorities in carrying out the provisions of this Bill from every occupier of land or property in an area.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tolley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a certain amount of sympathy with this new Clause, because a private individual who regards this Measure as applying specifically to him, in the sense that directions can be served upon him, will feel a natural resentment that a Government Department can go scot-free. It is said by the Minister that the Government Departments will take all possible steps to see that the provisions of the Act are complied with, but what could be wrong with accepting the principle of this new Clause? It has been stated this morning that one Government Department was in control of certain premises where a nuisance existed on a considerable scale and where rats and mice were allowed to spread to other premises. While it is true that the Bill provides for notice to be served on the private person, the Government Departments which create nuisances will go scot-free, and we must fasten the responsibility for all these nuisances where it belongs, so that those responsible may be called upon to answer for the consequences. I ask the Joint Parliamentary Secretary to look at the matter again, because a case has been made out and I have much sympathy with it. We ought not to create the impression that private people can be prosecuted while a Government Department can do as it likes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stubbs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Something should be done to meet the point raised by the hon. Member for Thirsk and Malton (Mr. Turton). I have some experience of this matter in my own constituency. Outside Newmarket there was an estate of between 2,000 and 3,000 acres of land, which was occupied during the war for military purposes. When the war was over it was occupied by prisoners, by Poles and others. Of course, we know that they have to be fed and that a certain amount of refuse is produced in these places, but when the occupants had
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 524</span>
gone the military authorities took no trouble to see that the camp was cleaned up. The rats, which had increased in number, spread all over the adjacent land, doing an enormous amount of damage. This was a case involving food supplies, and we know that food production is of great importance and must be encouraged wherever possible.<br><br>
12 noon.<br><br>
There were six stacks of wheat and barley which were destroyed. I am not exaggerating when I say that there were at least 600 rats in each stack. The farmer lost his stacks and has not got compensation. This sort of thing happens because there is nobody to take the necessary steps. It goes on quite commonly throughout the country in places which have been occupied by the Army or the Air Force. The owner of the land can do nothing, because his land has been taken over. The Government Departments are getting away with all this. Great damage is being done. Something ought to be done to see that the farmers are protected, and the landlords, too, when land is taken over by Government Departments, which should foot the bill. I feel prepared to support this Clause, because it is of importance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Captain Crookshank</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is something to be looked at again here. Crown property in private occupation, such as that in Regent Street and elsewhere in London, or anywhere else in the country, is already being looked after. That was the first point that the Joint Parliamentary Secretary made, but that is not the point under discussion. Of course, I recognise the difficulty there is under the constitutional point of view, that one Minister cannot lay an obligation upon another, because of our theory of the collective responsibility of all Ministers. I quite see that. However, I still think, in view of the cases which have been brought to our knowledge, that somehow or another something ought to be done. The right way may be to make some local co-operation necessary. It is important in these days, because not only is the Forestry Commission all the time extending its properties—quite rightly, under the wish of Parliament—but the powers of requisitioning are still very great and there is today still a great amount of land under requisition by the Government which is not being looked after by anybody. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1948-1949V003P0I0272">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 525</span>
hon. Member for Cambridgeshire (Mr. Stubbs) instanced camps which have gradually gone down in the scale, from being well organised air stations in the beginning to a few huts occupied by prisoners or displaced persons, then being camping abodes for a few squatters, and finally being quite empty. Yet they were, and they are at the moment, in the legal occupation of the Crown. There ought to be somebody locally who can be dealt with for this sort of thing, without necessarily having to cross Ministerial responsibility.<br><br>
I know my hon. Friend has raised a difficult problem here. It has not been raised before in such a concrete form. Now that it has been raised I hope the Minister will consider the case. The whole purpose of the Bill will be destroyed if there are considerable "islands" of infestation in the country—land or buildings surrounded by a wall marked "Crown property." The first thing is to get a plan, and the next thing is to carry it out; but it will not be easy to get a plan if there is this reluctance on the part of the Minister to force, as it were, his views on the other Departments. If he cannot enforce his views, because of the constitutional position, perhaps he can persuade his colleagues. Perhaps, the Government's answer today will be that that is the intention. One would have supposed that it had always been the intention to get rid of these pests, but if we look back at the record we do not see one of wonderful co-operation in the premises in the occupation of the Crown. If there were such a record there would be a different story; but we do not find that there is such a record. I hope the Joint Parliamentary Secretary will think of some device, without invoking the constitutional problem, by which this difficulty can be got round and the Bill carried out. If he can, he will have the support of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orr-Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should have felt very much happier about the Minister's answer if he had been able to say that he had already made arrangements with the Secretary of State for War, the First Lord of the Admiralty, the Secretary of State for Air, the Minister of Supply, and so on, to see to it that they undertook to comply with the general scheme of the Bill. A great deal of emphasis has been laid upon the necessity of adopting stand-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 526</span>
and methods and approved methods under specific directions from the Minister. If we are to have no undertaking at all, no arrangement under which Crown land is to be cleared of pests by the great and approved and specified methods laid down by the Minister, we shall make nonsense of a very large part of the Bill. That is what worries me very much. It seems to me that we are contracting out of responsibility for a practical attack on the problem—exposing our flank by not bringing in those who should be associated with this work.<br><br>
I should have thought that it would have been possible to have got some sort of general, embracing Clause here which would make the Crown liable for damage caused as the result of neglect of certain specified directions, and the refusal to carry them out on property occupied by the Crown. I quite appreciate the point about the difficulty of forcing an entry on to land occupied by the Crown. The point is, however, that we must get the occupier—in this case, the Crown—of premises to realise that he has a duty to people outside those premises. The only way to do that is to put something into the Bill about it. Whatever happens, I am disappointed that the Joint Parliamentary Secretary has not been able to tell us that he has received some sort of undertaking from other Government Departments as to what they propose to do in helping to make this Bill a practical attack on what is really a very grave menace to our supplies of food. It seems to me that if the Crown does not realise how very important this is, the private individual will not realise it either.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mitchison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This Clause reminds me a little of Donald Duck.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orr-Ewing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Who is that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir T. Dugdale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He is not on this Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mitchison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I see his shadow hovering here. These royal rats will be of so many different kinds. There will be those that get into military circles and appear in the appropriate costumes, with the rattish equivalents of swords, which may perhaps be treated as military rats—the War Office rats; the barrack rats. Then there will be the naval rats—that is why I thought I saw Donald Duck come in. Then there will be the Treasury rat and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1948-1949V003P0I0273">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 527</span>
the Treasury mouse. They will be specially hampered, because it is well known to the Committee that the only cat officially maintained by the Crown is the Treasury cat; and they will run very peculiar dangers. There are other kinds of royal or public rats that one can imagine quite easily. The one that gets into the Stationery Office will have a very peculiar and interesting time. We need not follow it into its adventures among the Government forms on a quiet Summer night.<br><br>
But seriously, is it really possible to accept this new Clause? The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Orr-Ewing) suggested that there might be an all-embracing plan—something of that sort. Whatever the plan may be, it seems to me that hon. and right hon. Gentlemen opposite, in putting down this new Clause, might have thought of it before doing so. I cannot see how this Clause could possibly work. The idea seems to be that the local authority will go charging into the War Office, or a barracks, or into the Stationery Office, or premises of the Forestry Commission, and, in default of rats and mice being put down by the proper authority, will be entitled to recover the cost of doing so as a simple contract debt. That is part of the new Clause. That rather shocked my legal mind.<br><br>
It is the first time, I think, in which any sweeping provision of this sort has been suggested. The usual method of recovering simple contract debts against the Crown is not as simple as all that. Without going into the matter in any detail, I may say that I thought some of the speeches made in support of the Clause rather recognised that it could not be practicable in the form in which it has been put forward. I rather fail to see what the Minister could have done. Indeed, I rather fail to see what it is suggested he should have done. Ought he to have come here with a suitable form signed by every other Government Department and public authority? If not, what was the suggestion? It is because I regard the new Clause in its present form as wholly impracticable, and because I think its impracticability in its present form is recognised by some of those who have spoken in support of it, that I cannot see that the Committee has any alternative but to reject it.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 528</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tolley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will not my hon. and learned Friend agree that there is some need to look into the matter further?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mitchison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is quite another matter. I am concerned with this new Clause.</span></p>
<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir T. Dugdale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a very important Debate—perhaps the most important discussion on the whole Bill. Apart from the hon. and learned Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison) who tried to put a red herring across our arguments, we have had constructive speeches. What can be done about this problem? The responsibility for solving it must be the Government's. All we want to do at this stage, having brought to the notice of the Government the real problems that exist as a result of leaving out Government Departments in this Bill, is to let them go away and think about it before the Report stage. The last thing anyone in this Committee wants to do is to ask Members to divide in favour of this new Clause. It would put Members in a difficult position.<br><br>
We started off on this Bill with the firm intention that there should be nothing political in it. We want to destroy rats and mice which are destroying almost two million tons of food every year. The Minister, speaking in the last Sitting, said:
<br><blockquote><p>"… Parliament has made up its mind to make an attack on pests of all kinds, particularly rats and mice. For the first time, in Clause 2 of the Bill, we impose a duty on every local authority to take such steps as are necessary and practicable to keep its district free from rats and mice."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Standing Committee D</i>, 3rd May, 1949; col. 75.]</p></blockquote>
If we leave out this section of the community, it will be impossible for the local authorities to carry out the intentions of this Bill. I am not blaming any particular Government Department, nor am I blaming any individual or section of the community, but by the very nature of Government Departments it is inevitable that their property is a source and harbouring ground for rats and mice. We have all had examples of this, and many of them have been given today in this Committee. We can all think of many other examples. Perhaps the one which has been brought to the notice of many of us is the Forestry Commission.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1948-1949V003P0I0274">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 529</span>
Then there are the dumps of the Ministry of Supply and land occupied by the naval authorities. All these various big storage places in different parts of the country are the harbouring ground for rats and mice, and unless we can ensure that this Bill affects the people responsible for these places, then I fear all our work will be wasted in consideration of this Bill, and all the money the Government proposes to spend on the attack on the rodent population will be money very largely wasted.<br><br>
I would ask the Joint Parliamentary Secretary to consider the whole problem with his right hon. Friend between now and Report stage. I would ask him to inform the right hon Gentleman that this Committee takes a very serious view of this problem, but also realises that under the constitution of our country Cabinet responsibilities must be upheld. But by some form of administrative action we must be able to bring in the various bodies to ensure that we destroy rats and mice in their premises.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Turton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think there has been a little misconception about this new Clause. The hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Kettering asked why this matter had not been raised before. For over two months every county council in England has been urging this new Clause on the Minister of Agriculture, and hoping that something would be done about it. The first time it was urged the point was neglected, and for the last month there has been negotiation with the Ministry on this point. It was only when these negotiations failed that I was asked by the County Councils Association to put down this Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mitchison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think I said so. It was quite inadvertently if I did.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Turton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept the hon. and learned Gentleman's assurance. It came after he was talking about Donald Duck. I think there is a feeling among Members that the Joint Parliamentary Secretary made a good point about property being in the ownership of the Crown with another occupier. There is the same lack of uniformity as in any other case. Under Clause 4, an owner who is not a Crown owner can be compelled to make structural alterations. As the Bill is drafted, in Regent Street for example, as my right hon. and gallant
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 530</span>
Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Captain Crookshank) said, there would be no possibility of getting structural alterations to deal with rats and mice. That is only one example, for there are many cases nowadays where the ownership is in the Crown and the occupier is somewhere else.<br><br>
I believe this really is a difficulty inherent in this rats and mice problem. As the Bill is drafted, nationalised undertakings or public corporations will be subject to it, but directly it comes to a Government Department, the Forestry Commission or the county committees, they are immediately excluded. A large acreage will be excluded, a great deal of which will be agricultural land. I do not want to divide the Committee on this new Clause; it is not a party matter. Local authorities are unhappy about this Bill for this reason, and I believe Members present today are also unhappy. I believe the Clause is correctly drafted, notwithstanding what the hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Kettering says. It was not drafted by me but by the County Councils Association, and there is more to be said for it than his scathing remarks would allow. I am willing to withdraw it if I can get an undertaking that the Minister will put down a Clause covering this point. I do not believe any other undertaking would be satisfactory.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. G. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to hear that final word, for I cannot undertake to put down an Amendment covering this point on Report stage. What I hope will happen is that now the position has been stated fairly it will be brought to the attention of other people. I hope the Clause will now be withdrawn and that we will have a discussion between now and the Report stage.<br><br>
I think we all are now quite clear in our minds about the constitutional difficulty of accepting the Clause. So many of the specific instances have been just the very instances that would have to be contracted out, even if we had this new Clause. As to the Forestry Commission, it is rather news to me that we are having this difficulty in co-operation. In view of the Minister's special responsibility for the Forestry Commission, I will undertake that the arrangements with them shall be inquired into straight away.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir T. Dugdale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Including Scotland?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1948-1949V003P0I0275">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 531</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will see the Secretary of State for Scotland as well. Regarding the battle training area, I was there yesterday discussing the matter with the people concerned, and as a result of the discussions I hope we shall be able to make arrangements to make quite sure that the pests in the battle area, apart from the assembly areas, shall be vigorously dealt with. Apparently, when I spoke earlier I did not give enough vigour to the arrangements we have already made. We think we have made the firmest arrangements with all the other Departments of State, the Service Departments and the Ministry of Works, to ensure that we have the fullest co-operation in getting a national attack on this problem. We have this consultative committee on which they are all represented, and we have at head office level no difficulty at all in getting consultation.<br><br>
The difficulty in all these cases is to get the instructions passed on to the local commanders, and to make sure there is the same local co-operation and determination. We think instructions will be issued right down the line, but I will ask my right hon. Friend to see whether arrangements can be made to secure the same degree of co-operation locally as we have provided for nationally. The Service Departments have told us that they are prepared as far as possible, with regard to these other difficult things, to allow local authorities to inspect camps and all such places. The difficulty of course is about the statutory right, which arises particularly in the inspection of secret places.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Captain Crookshank</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the secrecy point, would it not be a good defence if the Government Department said they could not give access because of secrecy?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. G. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are up against a much wider difficulty. It is never in fact done. We do not lay upon one Minister the duty of admitting other Departments or local authorities as a statutory right, as we are doing in this case. In fact and in practice, we shall have the local authorities being allowed in to inspect these camps and other places.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Brigadier Peto</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What is also necessary, apart from the fact that they are going to inspect, is that they co-operate with the local authority during a rat-week.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 532</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. G. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Having made these arrangements, which we hope will provide in the future a much bigger attack on vermin, whether on Crown property or elsewhere, we have now got to the position where the other Departments cooperate by doing the job. The Government is undertaking that all Departments will act as if they were bound by some such Clause, and instructions will be given right down the line that they must cooperate with local authorities as if the Bill applied to them officially.<br><br>
No one wants to minimise the problem. I believe we have made all the arrangements, without specifically putting it in the Bill, that Government Departments should act as if they were bound and do all that any other owner or occupier would be required to do. We see the constitutional inescapable difficulties of actually providing it as a statutory right. I will consider between now and the Report stage whether there is in fact anything further which can be done to provide more Departmental cooperation, so that we shall be able to get a bigger attack on this problem than in the past. I hope that with that firm undertaking hon. Members on both sides will be prepared not to press this new Clause.</span></p>
<p>12.30 p.m.</p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Turton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."<br><br>
This new Clause came to me from two sources, from the Royal Society of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the Rodent Operators' Association. In the old days, when the poison used against rats and mice was a virus poison there was no danger to other animals in the neighbourhood. Recently, especially since 1942, the use of virus poisons has been discontinued, and zinc phosphide and arsenic have been used extensively. I do not say that they are not better, but they are taking a terrible toll of pets and farm animals. I have a letter from a lady in my own constituency who lost two dogs within a year from zinc phosphide poisoning. She has been in touch with the R.S.P.C.A., who said that they had for some time been pressing to have it laid down that wherever these poisons are used a notice should be posted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dye</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The dogs could not read it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Turton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, but I hope the dogs would be under proper control. In my own part of the country dogs are usually under proper control. If not, I am not interested in their welfare, especially at the present time when we are losing so many sheep from attacks by dogs. The owner of he dog should be able to read the notice, and he would take care that the dog did not go rooting about where poisonous bait has been used.<br><br>
I have also been informed that frequently even the farmer himself does not know when this poisonous bait, the zinc phosphide or arsenic, is being used on his own farm by pest officers, and that as a result there have been extensive losses of poultry and pigs. In such a case written notice would not be necessary if the farmer were told by word of mouth that zinc phosphide and arsenic were being used on his land, because he would then ensure that his poultry and pigs were shut up during the period of danger.<br><br>
Let me quote from a report by the Rodent Operators' Association, who say:
<br><blockquote><p>"Enormous quantities of zinc phosphide and arsenic are now used all over the country. It will never be known what enormous numbers of pigs and poultry have been killed as a result. Both zinc phosphide and arsenic are constantly used for destroying rats in hayricks, and although instructions are given that poisons should be carefully used there can be no question but that much of the poisons go through
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 534</span>
threshing machines, which must be a terrible danger, not only to animals in poultry, pig and cattle foods, but also to human beings in the flour when extracted."</p></blockquote>
Whether or not the latter part of that warning by rodent operators is correct, it is a very serious matter, on which the Committee must think very carefully, to know whether we are not actually poisoning our own food as well as these animals by the use of zinc phosphide and arsenic.<br><br>
I think that I have made out a case. It is reasonable to ask that where these poisons are laid there should be some method of giving warning. As this new Clause is drafted the warning has to be given to
<br><blockquote><p>"the occupier of that land and the occupiers of land adjacent to that land."</p></blockquote>
I put that in because I think it only reasonable that a neighbour should know, especially in agricultural areas, where these dangerous poisons are being used on a farm. In particular, where farm buildings are close to each other there would be grave danger to poultry unless those words were in. However, if the Parliamentary Secretary thinks that is too wide, I am ready to accept any limitation of provision about adjacent land.<br><br>
The new Clause then goes on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"Where the person laying such poison is an officer or servant of a Government Department or a local authority … a written notice shall be posted on any premises where such poison is laid."</p></blockquote>
I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will think that is reasonable. Again, if he thinks that I am asking for too much I am perfectly ready to consider any limitation of those words. This is a new Clause which will improve the Bill, and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will regard it in a favourable light.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. G. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This again is a good example, perhaps the best we have had so far, of the impossibility of providing by Clauses in a Bill against all the difficulties which might conceivably arise. I do not think that the adoption of this Clause would do anything to help; indeed, it may get us into all kinds of difficulties. At the moment, if an occupier of land lays any poison for the purpose of getting rid of these pests, under the Protection of Animals Act, 1911, it is a defence against a criminal charge if he does it in such a way as
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1948-1949V003P0I0277">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 535</span>
not to constitute a danger, and if it is laid for this purpose, and he is not required to give notice of the laying of such poison. If we adopted this new Clause we should be changing the general law of the land, and I suggest this is not a desirable way of doing that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Turton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is only where poisons other than virus poisons are being used; it only concerns the use of zinc phosphide and arsenic, which are terribly dangerous.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It does mean amending the general law of the land, which I think ought to be done in a different place, and with much more discussion than we are able to give it on this limited Measure.<br><br>
If our officers lay poisons we must certainly notify the occupier. We not only notify him verbally but give him notice in writing. That is a constant instruction to our people. If that were not done we ourselves might be liable if there were some danger to a farmer's animals; we should face liability under the Common Law. In addition to requiring Government officers to do what apparently is not required of private contractors or the occupier himself, to post a notice on the occupier's buildings or fences would seem to me to be labelling the man as someone who had rats and mice on his land, and proclaiming to the world at large that he was a sort of pariah to be marked out as a leper. That would be a great discouragement to calling in our rodent officers, if the man knew that it would be blazoned abroad.<br><br>
The difficulty about notifying the owners of adjacent land is to know what would be adjacent land. As the hon. Member knows from his own part of the country, the adjacent land to a 1,000 acre farm would cover a substantial area, and one could never be sure that all the adjacent land had been covered. On the other hand, one might be notifying adjacent land when it is very unlikely that any animals would get through on to the occupier's land, while from another farm Which is not regarded as adjacent land, because there is no common boundary, animals might come in and eat the poison.<br><br>
At the moment it is the duty of the person laying the poison to notify the occupier of the land, and it seems to me that that is as far as we can go. If
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 536</span>
somebody else's animals trespass on to my land I fail to see what I can do about it, if I am to kill the rats and mice and other pests on my land. There is danger if my neighbour does not stop his animals trespassing, but I do not see how any restrictions can be placed upon me.<br><br>
On the Whole I think the position is quite all right as it is, with all the protections which owners and occupiers have. If those laying the poisons are negligent, they may well be liable under common law. There have been cases in which they have been liable, and I consider that a very great protection. There obviously is a danger, and we recognise that with the more dangerous poisons the area of danger is widened. If, however, folk fence their animals in the risk of contact and the danger are much reduced. For a variety of reasons, while some outside associations or rodent officers might like it, I must say that I do not think it would do anything practical to get over any of our difficulties; they would still be there. All we should achieve by accepting this new Clause would be a whole range of new difficulties. I hope that the hon. Gentleman, having made his point, will not press this new Clause, or that if he does the Committee will reject it. For my part, between now and the next stage I will, with my right hon. Friend, certainly consider whether there is anything more limited that we could do to be of practical assistance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Baldwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry the Parliamentary Secretary has not been a little more forthcoming, because there is a great deal in what my hon. Friend said. In these days, when extremely dangerous poisons are put down, the loss of life of both pets and other animals is great. The difficulty of giving notice to the owners or occupiers of adjacent land is not so difficult as the Parliamentary Secretary made out. While it would not be practicable to give notice to the occupiers of all land adjacent to a 1,000 acre farm, it would be possible to give notice to the occupiers of land within, say, 200 or 300 yards of where the poison is to be laid.<br><br>
I have in mind a case in my own district, where there were some ricks in a field, and immediately opposite to the field another set of premises; the occupiers of the field and of the premises are not particularly good friends, because
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1948-1949V003P0I0278">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 537</span>
rats from the premises get into the ricks in the field. I think it wrong that the occupier of the premises adjacent to the ricks should not be notified that bait is to he laid in the hedgerows near to those ricks. There is very great danger in laying these poisons, and the Ministry should give a little more thought to this problem. Those of us who live in the country and have to call in rodent operators know that it is extremely difficult to protect our own pets; and for anybody who has not had notice it is quite impossible.</span></p>
<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dye</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Members opposite are putting forward a principle which is very dangerous to agriculture. The hon. Member for Thirsk and Malton (Mr. Turton) spoke of dogs, but what dog under proper control has the right to go on some other farmer's land? As far as I know, it has no right whatever and is trespassing immediately it goes on that farm. Yet that is the dog which the hon. Member wishes to protect. The farmer has no obligation to protect wandering dogs or cats against dangers on his farm. One of the causes of their present troubles is, that dogs and other animals rove on their land and do damage. A dog under the control of its owner has no right to trespass on another man's farm. It would be impossible to have notices put up wherever poison is laid. Members opposite are putting up a false case and making a proposal which would be at variance with the best interests of British agriculture.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Baldwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be possible to put down poison by the side of footpaths and hedgerows where pets are likely to be taken. A notice of some sort should be put up warning the owner of a dog that poison has been laid.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dye</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that it is already illegal to lay poison that is attractive to a dog. I understand that the poison laid to kill rats today is not particularly attractive to dogs; it is attractive only to rats and is laid well under cover by every skilled operator.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Turton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for South-West Norfolk (Mr. Dye) has made a speech which was no doubt attractive to the National Farmers' Union, but shows a very selfish attitude.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. G. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: "Satan rebuking sin."</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 538</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Turton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thousands of people take out their pets on Sundays, and pets are being slaughtered—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dye</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Turton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I gave particulars of two very valuable pets which disappeared in one year from this method of poisoning. I wish to appeal to the Joint Parliamentary Secretary, who adopted a more reasonable and humane attitude from that of the hon. Member for South-West Norfolk. I do not think he has really assessed the problem in widely scattered areas. I can tell him of a farmer in the North Riding of Yorkshire, who has lost all his sheep dogs from phosphide poisoning. Whether it was laid by the pest officer on his land, or on adjacent land, I do not know, but he lost all his sheep dogs by it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dye</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely in that case the poison was laid on the express instructions of the farmer?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Turton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dye</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But no pest officer goes on to land without having entered a contract with the farmer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Turton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If he wants them, I can give the Minister the names in this case. Sheep trespassed from one heft to another heft, and the owner of an adjoining heft had contracted to put down poison. When phosphide is used one should be careful to give notice. I am not trying to change the law in regard to virus poison, but to see that notice is given when very dangerous arsenical and zinc phosphide poisons are used. I have support from the Rodent Officers' Association to show that farmers are losing an unnecessarily large amount of pigs—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. G. Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has often mentioned the Rodent Officers Association. Does he know when that association last met? It could not have considered this Bill, as my information is that it has not met for more than three years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Turton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not denying that, but if they have not met for three years and this poisoning of animals has continued, it should be deal with. Although it has not recently met its officers still exist, and I consulted the chief officer of

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 539</span>
the association after the Bill was printed. I know that what I am saying is up to date. They, and the R.S.P.C.A., say that this is a problem. However, I understand that an undertaking is being given that this matter will be looked into between now and Report stage, and if that is to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 540</span>
be done, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Motion.</span></p>
