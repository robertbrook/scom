	<p>Resolved:
	<br><blockquote><p>"That during the proceedings on the Agricultural Marketing Bill the Committee do meet on Thursday and thereafter on Tuesdays and Thursdays at Half-past Ten o'Clock."—[	<i>Mr. T. Williams</i>.]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call any Amendments, I wish to remind the Committee that the Financial Resolution of 25th January in connection with the Bill is on the Table. I desire to call attention to the fact that adequate notice of Amendments should be given, as moving them without notice causes inconvenience, and I do not intend to call manuscript Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 1.</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>—(COMPOSITION OF MARKETING BOARDS.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>10.31 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Major Sir Thomas Dugdale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 1, line 12, to leave out lines 12 and 13.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the Amendment is to remove the upper limit in the composition of the marketing boards. I would refer the Committee to the existing law on the subject, which is governed by Section 14 of the Agricultural Marketing Act, 1933, which appears to be entirely satisfactory. As the Bill before us is drafted, there is no real upper limit, since the Minister may at will increase the number above the 24 stated in the Bill. Hon. Members on this side of the Committee have no objection to the Minister having these powers, but we fail to see why he should be able to increase the number above 24, whereas, in preparing a scheme, a board has not the same privilege.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An example of where it may be necessary to have a number in excess of 24 would be in a very comprehensive scheme, covering a number of different commodities and covering England, Wales and Scotland, and, possibly, Northern Ireland. No useful purpose
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
would seem to be served by including the words which I am proposing to delete while the existing law, under Section 14 of the 1933 Act, is entirely satisfactory. In any event, when any board is preparing its scheme it is necessary to have the size of the board specified in the scheme. Since any scheme must have the approval of Parliament, there appears to be no object in placing an upper limit on the number of members, which is binding on producers, but not on the Minister. I rather expect the Minister's argument to be that, to have a workable body, it is a good thing to have an upper limit in order that it shall be compact. I would answer that by saying that if he is taking powers to increase over 24 the boards should have-equal powers. I think that the Bill would be improved if we omitted these words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of Agriculture (Mr. Thomas Williams)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and gallant Member for Richmond (Sir T. Dugdale) has put my case, perhaps, better than I could do. The two lines to which he refers act merely as guidance to marketing boards when deciding on the membership of a board. It would be possible for a board to have so many members that it would be unwieldy and could not discharge its business with dispatch. The Lucas Committee recommended that there should be an upper limit in order to obviate that possibility. They suggested a maximum of 16 members. However, on further examination, and in the light of experience over several years, we thought that to adopt the practice of the joint stock companies was perhaps wise, and that we should fix the upper limit at 24.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. and gallant Member suggests, a board may be dealing with a wide range of products and may need slightly more than 24 members. That would apply particularly if the board covered the whole of the U.K. where representation of regional bodies had to be provided. I hope that the decision of the Government will be approved. It is merely guidance to a marketing board, rather than the laying down of an impracticable proposition. All that the Government were called upon to do was to devise this guidance for a board which was formulating a scheme. I hope that the words providing for a minimum of eight and a maximum of 24, except in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1948-1949V003P0I0006">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
very special circumstances in which the Minister may feel that a number in excess of 24 is necessary, will be retained, and that the hon. and gallant Member will not press the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Turton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will reconsider this matter. This is no party question but, as he said, a question of giving guidance to an agricultural marketing board. The size of the board must have relation to the commodity produced and if we were seeking to formulate a scheme dealing with tomatoes and cucumbers we should not need a very large board. In fact 24 would be an unwieldy number for such a board, but if we were dealing with livestock products a very large board, fully representative of all the branches of the industry, would be required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Socialist Act of 1931 and under our Act of 1933 that was recognised, and it was felt that Parliament should make the decision when a scheme was put forward. If a board put up a top-heavy superstructure Parliament, acting with the advice of the Minister, would say that the number was too large and must be cut down. I suggest that between now and the Report stage the Minister might look at the question again to see if the guidance contained in the Clause is really necessary. It seems to be putting in a lot of unnecessary words, for the Minister allows himself to agree to a larger figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Lucas Committee were not very wrong when they said that the average number on the board should be 16. If it is permitted to be more than 24, too many boards will think that Parliament considers 24 to be the average and will appoint 24 members and so make the Act unworkable. I am not asking that there should be a snap Division on this, but that the Minister should reconsider the question in view of what has been said by my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Richmond (Sir T. Dugdale).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. York</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had hoped that the Minister would address himself to the argument of why it is better for the Minister to come to the decision on the number of members on the board than for the board to come to that decision. When one is considering a large commercial venture like a marketing board
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
it would seem that the board, run on commercial lines, would be far more capable of judging the number of directors—for that is what it amounts to—than the Minister. In refusing to accept the Amendment, I hoped that he would give some reason why he or his Department is more capable of making the decision than is the board. I hope that he will take the advice of my hon. Friend the Member for Thirsk and Malton (Mr. Turton).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Thirsk and Malton (Mr. Turton) knows that I am always willing to consider any point raised in Committee on any Bill for which I am responsible. I do not think it right, proper, or wise for Parliament to interfere, or even for the Minister to interfere, so long as the board do what seems to be the right thing. It may interest hon. Members, particularly the hon. Member for Thirsk and Malton, to know that the tomato and cucumber scheme which has been submitted suggests a board of 30, which he thinks is far too many.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir T. Dugdale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give an assurance that he will look at this matter again?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. In the light of this tomato scheme?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir T. Dugdale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, in the light of the Debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I will do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir T. Dugdale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of that assurance, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Colonel Gomme-Duncan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move in page 1, line 12, after "Minister," to insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"or in Scotland the Secretary of State or in Northern Ireland the Home Secretary."</p></blockquote>
It might be for the convenience of the Committee also to consider at the same time the next Amendment: In page 1, line 17, after "Minister," to insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"or in Scotland the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
It is not clear that the reference to the Minister is in fact a reference, in the case of Scotland, to the Secretary of State for Scotland, although it is possible, under Clause 21, where it says that the Act
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1948-1949V003P0I0007">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
shall be construed as one with the principal Act, that that definition may cover the point. Even if that is so, we think it should be perfectly clear in the early stages of the Bill, and I hope the Minister will give a categorical assurance that the Secretary of State for Scotland is meant in the case of Scotland so that we might clarify the situation at the beginning of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Joint Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Thomas Fraser)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and gallant gentleman has said that there is a later Clause which says that the Bill must be read in conjunction with the principal Act. That is the answer to the query which he has raised. In his Amendment he proposes to add after "Minister":
	<br><blockquote><p>"or in Scotland the Secretary of State or in Northern Ireland the Home Secretary."</p></blockquote>
Nowhere in the Bill does it say that the Minister shall, in England, be the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries. It merely says "the Minister" and the Minister is defined in Section 18 of the Act of 1931. The definition reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"in relation to a scheme applicable both in England and Scotland, … the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Secretary of State for Scotland acting in conjunction,"</p></blockquote>
and

and
	<br><blockquote><p>"in relation to a scheme applicable only in Scotland, … the Secretary of State for Scotland."</p></blockquote>
There is the definition of the Minister and this Bill proceeds to refer to "the Minister" and not to the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries. I think it is fully understood that it includes the Home Secretary in Northern Ireland and that as regards Scotland, it means the Secretary of State for Scotland. I hope that the hon. and gallant Member will accept that explanation as being adequate and will agree that in the circumstances there is no necessity to accept the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Amendment is to delete the reference to particular people and particular categories from whom the Minister has to select his members of the marketing boards. We feel that the Minister should be given an entirely free hand, and that the Clause should simply require him to select people who in his opinion are qualified for appointment. Our view is that if any particular categories are specified in the Bill the Minister will be handicapped in getting the best team.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In selecting a team of this kind the Minister will do well to find people with the same background. I have in mind that some of the nationalised corporations and boards are suffering today because the directors of these bodies have not got the same background but are a hotchpotch collection of people who have been selected because of their eminence in certain spheres of public administration and trade unions. But they have not got a common background which enables them to see the problems before the board in the same light. It may be desirable, for example, to have a housewife on one of the marketing boards. I would suggest to the Minister that if he decides that that is right, and that there is a suitable woman, he would do well to select an experienced member of the Women's Institute movement because she would have the same background as members on the board who have been elected by the producers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want the Boards to work together as a team—not only the producers' elected representatives but those whom the Minister has nominated. We do not want wrangles to go on within the board, and there is a real risk of that if the Minister is bound by the Bill to consider particularly these categories of
	<br><blockquote><p>"commerce, finance, administration, public affairs or the organisation of workers."</p></blockquote>
He may choose his best people outside those categories and as far as the public interest is concerned the Bill reinforces what the original Act laid down—that there should be public committees of investigation. If the board does go too far in one direction and is perhaps too biased on the producers' side the Minister can take prompt powers to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1948-1949V003P0I0008">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
check them immediately. We are anxious that the Minister should get a real working team and we believe that that will best be done by having people with a common background rather than by picking them here and there to satisfy particular interests which have nothing to do with the problems that the board is tackling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerald Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In political experience it has always been found dangerous to specify certain classes or certain types of people for fear that some may be left out. The list must be completely exhaustive or the matter must be left to the discretion of the Minister. The Minister must spend time hearing everyone's suggestions as to who they think should be included, so as to be satisfied that the list is exhaustive, or, else, as in our opinion, the list had better be completely omitted. There may be people who are not included in the definition proposed in the Bill. I suggest that a man with important experience of agriculture may well not be included in the definition of having capacity in "commerce, finance, administration, public affairs," etc. That might even be the case in regard to someone who has had great experience on marketing boards in the past. There might be a desire to include a housewife, as has been suggested. Unless everyone is covered by the definition it would be better to leave the Minister free, because he is responsible to Parliament for his actions. In this case we had better leave the choice to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture (Mr. George Brown)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised that this Amendment has been pressed so hard. To judge by the remarks of the hon. Member for Tonbridge (Mr. G. Williams) we must chose between spending a lot of time on this matter or accepting the Amendment. There is nothing very different in this provision in the Bill from the provision in the 1933 Act which has worked extremely well, and which, as the hon. Member for Thirsk and Malton (Mr. Turton) said, was one of the Acts for which his side of the House could claim responsibility and credit. In that Act, where there were fewer people to be co-opted to the boards, it was laid down that the persons co-opted should be persons who
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
were specially qualified for membership of the boards by reason of their commercial or financial ability. All the classes who are omitted by our definition, as the hon. Member for Tonbridge pointed out, are left out by that former definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of whether someone well qualified in agriculture is included in the definition is beside the point because the purpose of this provision is to put some members who, in a general way, will be the representatives of or the watch-dogs for the public interest, on the board; those who are well qualified in agriculture are in any case on the Board. Those who have knowledge of marketing schemes are on the board. There might be other people who know about agriculture but they would quite easily be embraced by this definition. The definition is so wide. Those chosen as members must have
	<br><blockquote><p>"capacity in commerce, finance, administration, public affairs or the organisation of workers."</p></blockquote>
To take the case of an experienced member of the Women's Institute, if she is not engaged in public affairs in her rural area I do not know who is. We are making heavy weather of something that will not get us into difficulty and which even in a narrower field has not got us into difficulty up to now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point about Members having the same background could be a most retrograde argument to develop in this Twentieth Century. For example, the mixing up here of Members whose backgrounds are not the same does not mean that we cannot co-operate as a team and bring our different kinds of experience to bear, to the great improvement of the final product. It seems to the Minister that the real point about this definition is that we are to put on these boards a small number of people with special experience to safeguard the public interest. It should be the kind of experience that will make them useful either because they are engaged in fields related to those on which the Board is making an impact, or have shown capacity in those fields. We feel that, having regard to the work to be done by these boards, very broad categories should be laid down, and I hope that the Amendment will be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
thought they would have been pleased to have words in the Bill to provide that if the Minister suddenly thought of someone suitable there was no possibility of him being prevented by the terms of the Measure. The words in the Bill must restrict his choice, and I should have thought that the Government would have been glad to have the widest field to look over rather than a smaller one. I am not at all impressed by a Minister saying that the provisions of the 1933 Act have worked well because there is a world of difference between co-option on to a board by someone and appointment to a board by a Minister. I think it is likely that members of a board may want to add particular people but it is different when a Minister wants to add them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is why we have widened the provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain Crookshank</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but under the 1933 Act there were only two categories. It is no assurance to be told that the Government have widened the definition now. It would be better to leave the door wide open. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will reconsider that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, there is the other point that since 1933, and more particularly since 1945, we have seen the creation of all sorts of boards for all sorts of purposes, and Ministers and Parliament have a wider knowledge of that subject than they ever had before. We ought to profit by what has happened in other fields with the various boards which have been set up during the lifetime of this Parliament. I dare say that if the Minister consulted some of his colleagues they might—I do not know, but they might—say that they had themselves been hampered by similar limiting words in, for example, the nationalisation Acts. One cannot tell that, because that is part of the inner arrangement of Government, but we have had the experience of other boards, and we have not always been very satisfied with the appointments Ministers have made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It struck me that there was another possibility of inclusion here. It may be that the Joint Parliamentary Secretary is right, and that Women's Institute members could come in under the definition "public affairs"; but it did strike me that the boards set up for a particular commodity would be likely to have, not
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
Ministerial appointments, but their own members concerned with that commodity. Yet it might very well be in the public interest that some other agricultural representative who had nothing to do with, say, tomatoes and the tomato board or milk and the milk board, should find a place on that board. I am not sure that this definition would allow an agricultural appointment to be made; I do not know, but I am not certain. Commerce, finance and administration are not agriculture, and I think it would be stretching the meaning of "public affairs" too far to include agriculture in it. Yet I can quite see that the Minister might want to put on the board an agriculturist who had nothing to do with the commodity with which the board had primarily to deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the sorts of arguments I think we ought to consider, at any rate before we finally pass this Clause. I still fail to understand why there should be any reluctance to have the widest possible field of choice, which is what this Amendment would give. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will think again before he decides to be adamant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Wills</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it possible under this Clause for the Minister to choose a representative of wholesale or retail distribution of farm produce?

Is it possible under the Clause to appoint someone with that experience?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to my hon. Friend is quite clearly "Yes." Obviously "commerce" would include wholesale distribution or wholesale anything else; it is somebody who has shown capacity in commerce. Let me make it clear, however, to avoid getting into difficulty later on, that the person appointed here is not to be appointed to represent a sectional interest; he is to be appointed as a member of a producers' marketing board, in this case with a wide general responsibility for the general public interest. However, it would not be possible for the Minister to appoint somebody engaged in wholesale distribution to perform the function of a wholesale distribution representative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer to the right hon. and gallant Gentleman the Member for Gainsborough (Captain Crook-shank) is that acceptance of this Amendment would leave the producers themselves with a feeling of uncertainty and doubt. It would mean that there should be appointed by the Minister persons who, in his opinion, were qualified for appointment—full stop. I have always thought that that would raise doubt in the minds of producers who would be asked to think about producers' marketing schemes. As a matter of fact, if we had finished at that full stop, I am quite certain that hon. Members opposite would then have come forward with an Amendment complaining about the wide field we had left, and pointing out the many evil and unhappy things that could be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain Crookshank</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why does the hon. Gentleman say that? What makes him think so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just the fact that by now I have got to know the right hon. and gallant Member and some of his colleagues. Indeed, had I been sitting on that side of the Committee and had the Government been doing that, then I, with my knowledge of producers, would have come along and said that this was very unfair, that the Government ought to know broadly the kind of folk they wanted to appoint to these producers' marketing boards under the powers they were taking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had a word with my right hon. Friend, and we think that this definition is broad enough to enable us to include the sort of people we are fairly sure will come along. One does not want to have to shut out anybody. On the other hand, one clearly does not want to have the kind of wide powers that would enable us to put on these boards any Tom, Dick and Harry. There must be some general guide from producers' interests, and it seems to me that all the types of people we want on the boards will get on. If there were a distinguished agriculturist in some other field of agriculture than that catered for who we thought would
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
be very suitable to serve on a marketing board, I cannot myself think of any circumstance in which he could not be included under one or other of these heads.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. G. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Joint Parliamentary Secretary think that a member of the Women's Institute is a "public affair"? It is the last thing in the world women's institutes like to be called, and I do not think that he would get away with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I had better make my meaning clear, to avoid any likely misunderstanding. I thought I said that experience in women's institutes, the running and organising of them, would certainly qualify as experience in public affairs. That is a long way from saying that a member of a women's institute is herself a public affair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real point is that, under this broad definition we can include the kind of person we want. Quite honestly, I cannot, in answer to the right hon. and gallant Gentleman's appeal, give an undertaking that my right hon. Friend will be moved on this matter. We have profited by the experience of other boards and the development of thought in the Government since the 1933 Act, and have accordingly drawn our definition as widely as possible. I will say, if this is of help, that between now and the Report stage we will certainly satisfy ourselves that the kind of people we might think we should want to be appointed are not shut out by the definition. Certainly we will do that, but subject to that we think that the definition ought to stay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hurd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman assure us that the type of people appointed will be capable of working together as a team?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Members on this side of the Committee, but I think that his concluding words, in which he said he would examine this point before the Bill becomes an Act to ensure that the Government get every kind of person they might require, goes a long way towards meeting us. It is important to be certain that if a suitable woman were available she could be appointed. It is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1948-1949V003P0I0011">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
very doubtful whether a suitable woman will always be a member of the local women's institute; she might not be a member of any of these things; she might not even have experience of public affairs, and yet she might be a very suitable person for appointment by the Minister to watch the consumers' interests. I hope very much that the Minister will give that and the other points further consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of what has been said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it meets the convenience of the Committee, I suggest that the next three Amendments—in page 1, line 20, to leave out "or"; in line 20, after "workers" to insert "or the organisation of consumers"; and in line 20, at the end to insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"one of whom shall be appointed after consultation with the Co-operative Union to represent the interests of consumers."</p></blockquote>
—be discussed together, and voted on separately, if necessary. Is that agreed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of this and the two following Amendments is to repair a fundamental omission from this Clause. We wish to safeguard the 50 million consumers of this country. It may well be that the Minister, in making his appointments from the classes mentioned in the Clause—that is, from commerce, finance administration, public affairs or the organisation of workers—may appoint one or two people who have an interest in consumers, but we want to have it clearly defined that an expert, either in wholesaling or retailing, should be appointed to the board in order that the consumers' interests would be directly represented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be found with the proposed composition of the board that there are representatives of the producers' and workers' interests, without the consumers' interests being represented. In that case the board will not be able to work as smoothly as it should. Under existing legislation past Ministers of Agriculture had powers to appoint two independent persons to serve on marketing boards, and in the exercise of that function the Minister found persons who
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
may have been experts in commerce or finance but who had precious little steadying influence on prices to the consumers. Indeed, it is not unfair to say that they so absorbed the agricultural atmosphere that their usefulness almost completely disappeared. We want to guard against that happening under this Bill, and I hope that the Minister will accept our Amendments, which would have the effect of stating specifically that consumers' interests should be represented on the board so that the board will function properly when set up. In our opinion that board will not function as it should if it is left as at present defined in the Clause. I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the consumers' interests are adequately safeguarded in this respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of Clause 1 (1, 	<i>b</i>) is not to secure the representation of any sectional interests but to widen the experience of the board, and at the same time to look after the public interests. In order that this may be done a general indication is given of the sort of qualification we are calling for in persons appointed to any one of these boards. We are all consumers, and under the Bill as drafted any person appointed could be a member of a cooperative society, and could be energetically determined to safeguard and protect the interests of consumers. If there were a case for consumer representation on the board this Amendment would not, unfortunately, achieve the object my hon. Friend seeks, for "experience of the organisation of consumers" would be restrictive and would confine the Minister's choice to a particular section of consumers, such as the Co-operative Union, the Housewives' League or women's institutes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But even there the Amendment suggests that it would be officials of those bodies who would have to be appointed. The interests of the consumers were safeguarded in the original Act of 1931 by consumers' committees consisting of certain persons, one of whom must be appointed after consultation with the Co-operative Union. Therefore, the cooperative movement and consumers generally are well cared for. It is assumed, of course, that not only will particular members of consumers' com-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1948-1949V003P0I0012">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
mittees in general safeguard the public interest but that they will at the same time also safeguard the so-called consumers' interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, the powers the Minister takes in Clause 2 to initiate action himself, as distinct from that after complaints from consumers' committees or elsewhere, and the extra power in Clause 4, is the last protection for the consumer apart from Parliament itself—which is the final arbiter and the safeguard of all public interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the Bill is to encourage wider use of agricultural marketing schemes both in the producers' interests and in the national interests. It fits in with the Government's general food and agricultural policy. It implies that producers' and consumers' interests are not necessarily antagonistic. I think that in 99 cases out of every 100 they must be complementary, and in the long run producers cannot hope to sell goods unless consumers are finally satisfied as to the price, quality and so forth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend will not be disposed to press this Amendment because if we were to start limiting ourselves we should be confronted with the problem that every wholesaler grocers' body would claim some right to representation—distributors, private traders, retailers and all kinds of people. It is far better, therefore, for the consumers' committee to remain intact, with one member appointed after consultation with the Cooperative Union; and to have the special appointments made by the Minister—a minimum of two or one-fifth, whichever number might be adequate as a safeguard—to the boards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This Amendment is self-explanatory, and I will not waste the time of the Committee by further explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel sure my hon. Friend will not press this Amendment. It may not have been appreciated that its only effect is to take away from the Minister the initiative which the Bill is seeking to give him. If the Amendment is inserted it will mean that the Minister can act only after receiving and considering complaints from those listed under (	<i>a</i>), (	<i>b</i>), (	<i>c</i>), (	<i>d</i>), (	<i>e</i>) and (	<i>f</i>). If he has to wait to consider complaints from what in effect is the whole population of Great Britain, the situation will be a good deal worse than it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position at the moment is that anyone can make a complaint, and the complaint can be referred to a committee of investigation, which reports to the Minister, and may take action. Under the Bill as we are now drafting it, the Minister will be able to move even if he receives no complaint at all. That is very much wider than the present position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Wills</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of my hon. Friend's explanation, I beg leave to withdraw the Amendment.

	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lennox-Boyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 3, line 48, after "question," to insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and the extent to which the directions contained in an order under subsection (2) of this section or any of them will or will be likely to result in registered producers being unable to produce the regulated product at a price consistent with proper remuneration and living conditions for such producers and the workers employed by them."</p></blockquote>
This Clause provides that if the Minister thinks that a proposed act or omission of the board may cause certain consequences, he may set up a committee of investigation. The field of that committee is severely limited and the purpose of this Amendment is to widen it. It is solely
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1948-1949V003P0I0013">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
limited to the four results listed in paragraphs (	<i>a</i>) to (	<i>d</i>) of Clause 2 (2). In so far as these four results may lead to the public interest being harmed, the committee may act. It may be unfair to the producers concerned because consideration of a direction from the Minister by the committee of investigation may well result in a serious net loss to a large group of producers. That is particularly important to horticultural producers who have two disadvantages: their crop is highly perishable and is frequently gathered over a short season, and they have no guaranteed prices or market, as have most other branches of agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of our Amendment is to provide that if the result of the order or threatened order of the Minister is to cause a net loss to producers, then the committee of investigation shall be entitled to look into the producers' complaint. The Amendment is in no sense mandatory—it only allows the Minister to consider that effect on the producers. I feel sure that that will commend itself to both sides of the Committee. It would certainly do much in my constituency to reconcile horticulturists to this Bill and calm their fears in certain particulars.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot help but feel that there was some slight confusion in the mind of the hon. Gentleman the Member for Mid-Bedford (Mr. Lennox-Boyd) or whoever put down this Amendment. That is understandable; I have been confused on many occasions myself. What they probably mean is that a direction might reduce prices unduly or hold prices so that production costs would not be considered. If one considers the circumstances under which the Minister can make an Order under Clause 2, it is difficult to imagine how the Minister's direction could have the effect contemplated by the hon. Member. Paragraphs (	<i>a</i>), (	<i>b</i>), (	<i>c</i>) and (	<i>d</i>) of Clause 2 (2) show clearly that the Minister can act only to prevent restrictice practices by a board which might raise prices unduly against the consumer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems absurd to suggest that in the prevention of restrictive practices the Minister can deprive producers or workers of proper remuneration for their labour, especially in the case of guaran-
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
teed price commodities. I agree that horticulture is not within the Schedule, and to that extent its case is slightly different, and the Minister can only step in if a board has taken a decision to do something new. That would mean, perhaps, increasing prices or any one of the four items referred to in Clause 2 (2). The Minister has certainly no power to do anything to cause a reduction in the price of any particular commodity. Therefore, I hope that the hon. Member will see that there is no necessity for the words of this Amendment in the Bill. We shall be able to deal with this subject more extensively on Clause 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The power is always in the hands of a board to decide whether they should move forward and take decisions to change the situation in regard to marketing schemes. If the board were to take such a decision and the Minister thought it was contrary to the public interest, he would be obliged to give them 28 days' notice that he considered that a change would not be in the public interest. During that time the board would have ample opportunity to examine the position. I cannot see that there is any possibility of reducing prices and robbing producers or workers of proper remuneration for their activities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Turton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think the Minister has made the situation much clearer. Surely the position is not what he said. Let us assume that producers in the horticultural industry are finding that they cannot maintain standards or profits and wages in that industry, and that the marketing scheme puts forward certain proposals that will have the effect of making the industry more remunerative. The Minister then comes into the picture and says that he objects to these proposals for one of the reasons listed in paragraphs (	<i>a</i>) to (	<i>d</i>) and gives some direction that will alter the policy and proposals of the board. The horticulturists look at the proposals and directions, and ask that the matter be referred to the committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that this Amendment is asking is that when the committee are considering the Minister's directions they shall take into consideration what the effect of these restrictions will be on the level of wages and profits in the horticultural industry. That is the purpose of the Amendment, whether right or wrong. It is no use

the Minister trying to muddle it up by saying that his direction would not have that effect. If his directions were always right, there would be no purpose in remitting them to the committee appointed. Surely this is not an unreasonable request, when one looks at the position of some horticulturists in the past year. We have seen newspaper pictures of some growers ploughing in their leeks.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Turton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 4, line 2, to leave out from "shall," to "shall," in line 3, and to insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"lay the report before both Houses of Parliament and."</p></blockquote>
This Amendment deals with what happens to the report of the investigating committee when it is made. The Bill lays down that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Minister on receiving their report shall forthwith publish the conclusions … in such manner as he thinks fit."</p></blockquote>
We are suggesting that those words should be slightly altered so as to conform with the Monopolies and Restrictive Practices (Inquiry and Control) Act passed last year. Quite clearly, there is a very close parallel between the provisions of this Bill, dealing with marketing boards, and the Act to which I have just referred, which deals with other industrial monopolies. During the passage of that Measure I and a number of my hon. Friends made the point that we thought that it would really be better if the agricultural marketing boards came within that Act and received the same treatment. During the Second Reading Debate, the Minister really reinforced our point of view, and in two passages of his speech made his own attitude quite clear. He said:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
	<p>Committee will not reject this Amendment on the very poor argument put forward by the Minister. We want some measure of security for producers in order to maintain wages and profits in the different branches of agriculture.</p>
	<p>Question put, "That those words be there inserted."</p>
	<p>The Committee divided: Ayes, 12; Noes, 19.</p>
	<p>"I think it is quite proper to see that they are subject to the same sort of scrutiny and control as are applied to industry and trade."</p>
	<p>There, he was speaking about the parallel between the two Measures. Later on, when he was saying how he proposed to have one member of the committee appointed by the Monopolies Commission, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Many questions which the committee of investigation will have to consider will be similar to the questions dealt with by the Monopolies and Restrictive Practices Commission. I think, therefore, that it will be necessary to have an overlap of membership."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 19th January, 1949; Vol. 460, c. 191.]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>Is that not asking that there should be adopted, not only an overlap of membership, but also an overlap of practice in dealing with these reports?</p>
	<p>Hon. Members will recall how in the Monopolies and Restrictive Practices (Inquiry and Control) Act, 1948, Section 2 leaves out the marketing boards, and Section 9 lays down:
	<br><blockquote><p>"When the Commission report to the Board of Trade on any matter referred to them under the preceding provisions of this Act for investigation and report, the Board may, and, unless the reference was so framed as to limit the investigation and report to the facts, shall, lay the report before each House of Parliament."</p></blockquote>
I am quite certain that we who represent our constituents feel that any report by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1948-1949V003P0I0015">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
this very authoritative committee should be laid on the Table of both Houses of Parliament and published in that manner, because that is the proper manner of publishing reports of committees. I do not think there can be any great issue on this occasion between the two sides of the Committee, and I hope that the Minister will accept this Amendment.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that there is any very big issue here. On the other hand, I am not at all sure that the hon. Gentleman is on a good point. When he was reading from the Monopolies and Restrictive Practices (Inquiry and Control) Act, it was very significant that he stopped quoting where he did. Section 9 of that Act certainly says "the board may." I would emphasise the word "may" as the hon. Gentleman emphasised something else. It goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and, unless the reference was so framed as to limit the investigation and report to the facts, shall …"</p></blockquote>
That clearly indicates that the reference may be limited so as to prevent the Board from being compelled to lay. Then it goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>a</i>) if it appears to the Board of Trade to be contrary to the public interest that the report, or some part thereof, should be made public, the Board of Trade shall lay before Parliament only so much, if any, of the report as in their opinion can be made public without injury to the public interest."</p></blockquote>
There is no absolutely compelling reason in that Act which prevents the Board of Trade from deciding whether a full report shall or shall not be laid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Turton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was probably not on the Committee and, therefore, does not know the history of that proviso. It was inserted to deal with secret processes, but I do not think that there are many secret processes in agriculture.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. Gentleman will find that what he is talking about appears in paragraph (	<i>b</i>) which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If it appears to the Board of Trade that the publication of any information contained in the report as to any secret process of manufacture …"</p></blockquote>
I am speaking of paragraph (a), which is an entirely different matter. There could well be the same kind of reasons against being compelled to publish a re-
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
port of the committee in this case as in the case of the monopolies Act. We may well find that the kind of evidence that emerges is the sort which we would not wish to be compelled to distribute widely. I do not think I need pursue this matter very far. In the past, we have published the conclusions, but in one case we published the report. We do not think that if the Clause remains as it is we should be prevented from doing that in the future. It might be that if we were compelled to publish the report in every case it would be very dangerous, and would react against the interests of the producers and everybody else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. York</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it the point at issue between the two sides is that one of them wishes to put the matter on to the shoulders of the Minister to say what is dangerous in some way or other to the public interest, and the other side wants to say that the onus should be on the board. That does not seem to me to be quite right and fair. If in one Act the Government accept a situation in which they have a safeguard, then why cannot they do so in another Measure? That is the point that strikes me as inconsistent in the reply of the hon. Gentleman, although I think it is a very narrow point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sufficiently legally-minded to understand all its implications, but it seems to be right that if we have the general intention of the Government to have all the reports of investigating committees under the monopolies Act published, then, in any particular case where public confidence is very much involved, there should be no more in this Bill to protect the Minister of Agriculture than the safeguard contained in the monopolies Act. If, where there is a secret process, he has the power to withhold publication, that is all very well, but as I read the Clause as it stands, it is left entirely to the opinion of the Minister as to whether he publishes the report or not. We do not think that is fair either to the consumers affected or to the producers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Turton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the position has been clarified a good deal by what the Joint Parliamentary Secretary said. We now know that instead of the findings of the committee being published in a hole and corner manner, in, say, the parish magazine, the full report will be laid before Parliament. That seems to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1948-1949V003P0I0016">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
me to be a very close parallel to what has been done by the Monopolies Commission. Surely, the right thing to do is to adopt the same procedure as in the case of the Monopolies Commission. I did not read the whole of Section 9 because I was trying to save the time of the Committee, but I read the material part of it. If the Minister wished to have the two provisions of Section 9 of the monopolies Act inserted in this Bill, I would support that. If he would give an undertaking to do that on the Report stage, I would be quite content to withdraw this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir T. Dugdale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A very useful contribution has been made by my hon. Friend the Member for Thirsk and Malton (Mr. Turton). The monopolies Act has now become law. Probably when this Bill was drafted there was not close consultation with the draftsmen of the monopolies Act. That was a completely non-party Measure and we hope that it will be useful for the community as a whole. Would it not be better to try to use words in this Bill which very closely follow the words in the monopolies Act?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I still feel that on the whole the words in this Bill fit the circumstances of the industry but, in the light of what has been said, we shall look at the matter again between now and the Report stage and see whether it would be wise to include this suggestion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Turton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that understanding, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>Amendment made: In page 4, line 2, leave out "report," and insert "committee."—[Mr. 	<i>T. Williams</i>.]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 4, line 7, to leave out from the beginning, to "unless," in line 8.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of this Amendment is to cut out unnecessary consultation between the board and the Minister. I see no reason why the Minister, having given notice in writing to the board of action he proposes to take, should again consult the board before actually making an order. In seeking to keep the farmers informed, he may overdo the business of
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
consultation with producers before making an order. I am sure that before taking any step the Minister would go very fully into the matter and that he would be on sound ground before taking action. It seems unnecessary that he should have to go back and consult the board before taking action. The balance between the board and the Minister should be safeguarded, but in this case the Clause is a little over-cautious. I hope that the Committee will accept the Amendment, in order to cut out unnecessary consultation and allow the Minister a little more scope, without taking powers away from the board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be impossible to proceed in any other way than the Bill proposes. The matter has to be referred and a report obtained and, ultimately, the board have to do something. The board have to carry out the order when it is made, and at some stage there must be discussion between the Minister and the board as to the effects of the order and what action is called for. It may be that the board may modify the proposals, or modification may be called for from both parties, or the Minister may have to make the order. Obviously there would have to be consultation, but a very short period of time is allowed during which the temporary order is in force. It is difficult to see how the matter could be dealt with without provision for consultation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We had some doubts on this matter, but, on the assurance of the Parliamentary Secretary that it will be attended to, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Turton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 4, line 14, at the beginning to insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"where it appears to the Minister that the result or one of the results of the relevant act or omission or intended act or omission of the Board will be such as is specified in paragraph (c) of the said subsection (2) and."</p></blockquote>
Here we come to the position in which the committee and the Minister are in disagreement. When the committee have given a report relating to a guaranteed price commodity and the Minister thinks they are wrong, unless we put in some words like these, it will mean that, where the disagreement has no relation to price, the Minister can still overturn the report of the committee. I admit at once that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1948-1949V003P0I0017">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
where one of the relevant matters is that of price it is quite right that the Minister, who is guaranteeing the price, should have the right to overrule the report of the committee. There is no issue between us on that point, but there are many cases one could envisage where the disagreement will not be about price.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there were a marketing board for barley, for instance, although there was a guaranteed price for barley, the board might suggest proposals to enable the barley to be marketed by some new form of grading to ensure a better return and a speedier disposal. Unless we have some such words as we propose, the Minister could make directions and the committee of inquiry could come to the conclusion that the Minister's directions were entirely wrong, that the barley board were right, and that their producers would get the barley disposed of more speedily through better channels. The Minister, although he had that report, could overrule them and go ahead with his directions. That does not seem to be the kind of procedure a Minister would wish to have, nor, from my knowledge of the Minister's administration, the kind of procedure he would be prone to adopt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to accept this small limitation on his powers of overruling the investigation committee. All farmers, on both sides of the Committee, are anxious for a long tenure of office of the present Minister during the short time that remains of the power of a Socialist Government—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Turton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: —but it may be that he will be Minister of Defence, or Chancellor of the Exchequer and there may come another ruler of agricultural affairs who might overrule the report of such committees rather more frequently. It is in the interests of agriculture that we should have such saving words as those which are proposed. In dealing with price we should remember that there is an absolute guarantee, but when dealing with marketing there is not such a guarantee. We are finding that the guarantee of a market, whether it is barley or potatoes, is not an absolute guarantee today. By the limitations of Section 1 of the Agriculture Act, farmers are finding that they have to keep their commodity, on which
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
the price is guaranteed, for such a long time that the commodity deteriorates. In looking at the marketing side, it is only right that a marketing board should make proposals which will fall under the headings (	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>) of Subsection (2). It is only right that when the committee have examined and passed those proposals, and have acquitted the marketing board, the Minister should not have power to condemn them and thereby make them lose very considerably, financially, or otherwise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. York</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to support my hon. Friend and impress on the Committee that the purpose of this Amendment is to make the public interest paramount. [	<i>Laughter</i>.] The hon. Member for Thornbury (Mr. Alpass) laughs at that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alpass</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. York</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Member will study the Clause a litle more, and when he understands the Amendment he will see, as the discussion proceeds, that that is a fact. That may surprise the hon. Member, as I know he has a suspicious mind. To get back to my theme, the Clause as drafted provides certain safeguards in the public interest, one of which is that an order can be made where the committee of investigation says that the act or omission of the board is against the public interest. I think we all agree with that as a sound principle. The Minister then steps in with an entirely different conception and says that because we passed the Agriculture Act, 1947, he must have additional powers so that any commodity included in the First Schedule of that Act shall be completely outside the control of the committee of inquiry when they are making their report, and shall be entirely in his hands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us examine how far the Minister wishes to go. Referring back to Subsection (2) of this Clause we find that he wishes to have powers to control not the marketing board but the committee of investigation in its report and pronouncements upon the use of a commodity, or the quantity used. So long as we have a committee of inquiry it seems to me that it would be a good thing to allow it full scope properly to consider the implications of any act or omission of a board on the use to which a commodity is put or the quantity used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1948-1949V003P0I0018">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
Subsection (2, 	<i>b</i>) is to limit the quantity or the produce from that commodity. I cannot see anything in the Agriculture Act, if we had the full intentions of the Government explained to us during the passage of that Act, which would make it inappropriate for a committee of inquiry to pronounce on anything that might arise out of the limitation on quantity. If it is against public interest, steps should be taken to stop it, but why should the Minister say that the committee of inquiry are incapable of dealing or are incompetent to deal with the matter?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2, 	<i>d</i>) is to limit the classes of persons, and here again public interest has to be served. But, why should the Minister again say that the committee of investigation are quite incapable of coming to a proper conclusion of what is the public interest in the matter? I see no reason why, if the Minister is determined to live by the spirit as well as the words of the Agriculture Act, he needs any special protection in regard to the commodities mentioned in the First Schedule to the Act, other than that of price, which is specifically mentioned in the first section of that Act. I feel it would be no less reasonable to ask that he should trust his committee of investigation and let them decide. Surely they will be properly constituted to decide what is or what is not against the public interest?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The two hon. Members who have spoken have put their case so modestly as to make me feel that I ought to embark upon further self-analysis to see if I am not becoming Public Enemy No. 1 for the Treasury. It is difficult to argue strongly against the hon. Members but the Committee really should know just what is behind this Amendment. The proviso to Subsection (4) lays down the conditions which must exist before the Minister can make an order under Subsection (2), in the case of a matter affecting a product which is not scheduled under Part I of the Agriculture Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister cannot make an order unless the committee of investigation find that the order will have certain results contrary to the public interest, but in the case of a scheduled product for which the price and market are guaranteed, the Clause gives the Minister a wider discretion. He is empowered to
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
act even though the committee disagree with the views on which the Minister founds his action. In this proviso the Government have endorsed the views of the Lucas Committee that guaranteed prices in a market for a product give the State a very special interest and responsibility in the matter of—and these words are important—what happens to that product.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment proposes to limit the Minister's power in the event of a disagreement with the committee to one set of circumstances as compared with the four sets of circumstances in Clause 2 (2). The Amendment would only permit him to act in the event of disagreement between the committee and himself if it appeared that the result of the board's act would be to regulate prices. The hon. Member for Thirsk and Malton (Mr. Turton) conceded that when the Government are guaranteeing prices they must be able to override a conflicting price determination by the board. Having made that profound concession he proceeded to say that the Government should not in any one of the other three circumstances have the same powers. Surely results equally dangerous to the public interest or the Government's policy might flow from acts of the board which produces results under the four paragraphs (	<i>a</i>), (	<i>b</i>) (	<i>c</i>) and (	<i>d</i>) of Subsection (2)?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph (	<i>a</i>) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"to restrict the purposes for which the regulated product, or any description thereof, is used, or to limit the quantity of the regulated product, or of any description thereof, which is used for any particular purpose."</p></blockquote>
That is to say that the Board could restrict in any manner they liked and the Minister would have no powers whatever. Paragraph (	<i>d</i>) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"to limit the classes of persons to whom or through the agency of whom the regulated product, or any description or quantity thereof, or any commodity produced therefrom, is sold, whether by registered producers or by other persons."</p></blockquote>
In other words, the board could completely cut out any distributor they liked from dealing with any particular product, and the Minister would be powerless. I am sure that the hon. Member for Thirsk and Malton would not like to see that position arise. He knows that Parliament would immediately be up in arms against it and that it would be contrary to the public interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the board would not do it there is no point in the limitation set by this Amendment, and there is no point in putting in words unless it is feared that the possibility might occur.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Turton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are interested not in the board but in the committee of investigation. Is the Minister suggesting that if the committee of investigation are not really going to look at the public interest they are not to be trusted, and that he will pay no attention to them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member makes the admission that where the price is under review—and if there is anything which is important to producers it is price—the Minister should have the power referred to. If he concedes that the Minister should have power where price is affected, surely, where it is a question of determination of purpose for which a product shall be used, that is of some importance. For example: shall oats remain in Scotland for animal consumption or shall they come to England for human consumption?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then there is the question of the quantity of the product. Surely if the Government guarantee the markets and the price and yet the industry or the marketing board is to have power to determine the quality of the goods, the whole conception of the Act of 1947 goes by the board? If, when the Government have guaranteed not only the price but the market, the Minister is left without any powers to act in the national interest, that is contrary to the wishes of members of marketing boards themselves and they would not desire that limitation. All these matters equally affect the consumer in one form or another, the Government's food policy and the Exchequer's liability under Part 1 of the Agriculture Act. I hope that the hon. Gentleman, in conceding (	<i>c</i>), will not object to (	<i>a</i>), (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>d</i>).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir T. Dugdale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Minister has got hold of the wrong end of the stick in this matter. There is nothing in the least sinister about the Amendment. All we want to do is to promote initiative in the marketing boards and not get them cluttered up by fear of the Minister
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
taking refuge and operating under paragraph (	<i>b</i>) of Subsection (4). As my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Thirsk and Malton (Mr. Turton) said, we accept at once that where an article which is scheduled in the First Schedule of the Agriculture Act, 1947, is concerned it is perfectly right that the Minister should use the procedure under paragraph (	<i>b</i>), but we feel very strongly that that provision should not be used for the other three provisions in Subsection (2, 	<i>a</i>), (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>d</i>) without the matter first going before a committee of investigation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph (	<i>a</i>) restricts the purpose for which the product may be used. An example of that would be if there was surplus liquid milk being used for the manufacture of cream instead of cheese where the national interest demanded the manufacture of cheese. Paragraph (	<i>b</i>) limits the quantity of the regulated product, and a good example is the old scheme of potato regulation or the hops quota scheme. Paragraph (	<i>d</i>) limits the classes of persons to whom or through whom the product may be sold. It must be noted that the Minister cannot direct the board to serve only one class of person but can prevent the board themselves deciding to do so. I think that is a correct interpretation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point of the Amendment is to try to encourage the board, in exercising their initiative, to rely upon the committee of investigation to look into the question in the public interest for the Minister, and to give him powers under paragraph (	<i>b</i>), which is different from the procedure in relation to prices for articles in the First Schedule of the Act. We are not wedded to the actual wording of the Amendment, but I hope that in our short discussion we have made our intention clear, and that the Minister will look at the matter again between now and the Report stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. York</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's statement shows that he has accepted what I believe to be a wrong conception put forward by the Lucas Committee's Report. It is fundamental to the discussion we are having that we should be quite clear where the Government stand on this issue. In the Lucas Report it is argued—and I am sorry that the Minister of all people accepts that proposition—that it is the taxpayer who. in effect, buys produce at the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1948-1949V003P0I0020">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
point where the guarantee operates. That is a proposition we shall never accept. It is entirely foreign to the conception of the English language that when one guarantees a price one actually buys the produce. That is what the Minister is arguing. That is the fundamental difference between him and us as to the powers which he chooses to retain in his Ministry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposition the Minister is putting forward is this: he says that it is his intention that the Ministry shall plan details of food production and distribution throughout the country and that the marketing boards have no right to make plans, to make orders or to direct produce unless he approves of those measures. This takes the whole purpose of marketing away from the marketing boards. There is no point in having marketing boards for First Schedule commodities while the Minister of Food and the Minister of Agriculture retain these powers and intend to use them. It is that reason that has caused me to speak once more, and to point out that that is the Minister's intention. When I was talking about the matter he appeared to disagree with me. If that is not his intention he had better say so. As I understood his argument and the reasons that have made him include this provision in the Bill, it is so that he and other Government Departments can maintain a detailed control of all food production and distribution for all commodities which are covered by the First Schedule to the Agriculture Act. If I am wrong in that let us have a denial of it from the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Earlier on the hon. Member said that I did not want marketing boards to have power to do this, that and the other. If that was my view, and if I did not want farmers to have power to organise the marketing of their products, I should not have introduced this Bill at all; we should have been wasting our time. I repeat, the Lucas Committee said that where the Government guarantee a price and a market for a product the State has a very special interest and a responsibility in what happens to that product.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know this is a far-fetched suggestion, but let us assume that some meat marketing board decided that none of the pigs sent to it by its registered members
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
should be sold through the Co-operative Wholesale Society. That is quite conceivable, although I am not suggesting that it is likely to happen. The Government having guaranteed the price and the market for beef, bacon or pork, it could happen that a board could determine to whom they should sell and to whom they should not sell. I know it is suggested that that is an unlikely contingency, but the hon. Member for Thirsk and Malton (Mr. Turton) having conceded the question of price, I do not quite see how he can escape the use to which the product shall be put, or the channels of trade through which it might be sent. I hope, therefore, that he will feel disposed not to press the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Turton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has given the illustration of some board, and also some committee of investigation, saying that it is to the public interest that pigs should not be distributed to Co-operative Wholesale Society, and that therefore he should have power to interfere. What is he really suggesting? If it is soft fruit, then it is all right; he has no power to interfere. If it is wool he would never dream of interfering; it is perfectly right for a marketing board to say that the Co-operative Wholesale Society shall not handle wool. But when it comes to bacon he apparently should have the power to overrule their decision. Surely that shows that there is something very wrong with the procedure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is apparently confusing scheduled and non-scheduled commodities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Turton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am explaining to the Minister how an argument that applies to scheduled commodities would 	<i>a fortiori</i>, apply to non-scheduled commodities. It is quite ridiculous to suggest that any marketing board would act so partially as the Minister suggests; but I would say that it is a very disgraceful thing to suggest that a committee of investigation set up by him to see what is or is not in the public interest would act in such a way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister further challenged me, I must say that ever since the period of office of the right hon. Member for South-port (Mr. R. S. Hudson) at the Ministry of Agriculture, we have had the food price review, in which the Minister comes in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1948-1949V003P0I0021">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
and discusses questions of price with the leaders of the industry. It is quite proper that when prices are involved he should have the final word, notwithstanding anything said by the marketing board or the committee of investigation, because he discusses those matters, not with the marketing boards but with the leaders of the National Farmers' Union and the National Union of Agricultural Workers. That is why price is omitted from our Amendment. However, it will make the whole of this Bill quite useless if in the case of all scheduled commodities the Minister is to have power to overturn a decision of the committee of investigation on matters of detail as to the size of the</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lennox-Boyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 4, line 31, to leave out from "shall," to the end of line 32, and to insert:

The effect of this Amendment would be to substitute the affirmative for the negative procedure when orders made under this Clause come before the House. As hon. Members know, orders of great importance, possibly involving great prejudice to producers, may be made under this Clause. It has already been seen that the committee of investigation will not have power to consider the effect on producers of the actions the Minister has taken, and orders made by the Minister will therefore be of prime importance to many producers. We do not think that they should be smuggled through at 11 o'clock at night, and subject only to the Prayer procedure of the House of Commons. We feel that time should be found by the Government, and at a more reasonable hour, so that matters of this importance affecting producers should be discussed in a more tranquil way. Apart from that, those of us who are anxious</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>The Committee divided: Ayes, 13; Noes, 18.</p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is quite clear to us that what the Opposition are worried about is, starting the next General Election not on equal physical terms but on equal spiritual terms: their powers of prayer at 11 o'clock at night have begun to run out.

I do not think that there is very much difference between us. We are here carrying on—and perhaps the hon. Member did not quite appreciate it—exactly what was laid down in the principal Act of 1931, and what was left unchanged by the hon. Member's party when they embodied it in the Act of 1933. Under Section 9 of the 1931 Act the Minister, after receiving a report, may do one of three things: he may amend the scheme, he may revoke a scheme, or he may direct a board to rectify the matter. In the case of an order amending a scheme or giving a direction, the order is subject to negative resolution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1948-1949V003P0I0022">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
It is only in the case of an order which actually revokes a scheme—which is obviously a very drastic and final thing—that an affirmative resolution is required. We really believe that in this case the Minister's direction to a board is clearly a direct parallel of either amending a scheme or giving directions under Section 9 of the 1931 Act, and, therefore, quite properly brings into being the same procedure. Only on any matter analogous to revocation is there an affirmative resolution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no question of our trying to smuggle anything through. This has been the accepted procedure; precedents are there, and the procedure has worked very well. Quite apart from that, we must keep a sense of proportion. The affirmative procedure of the House has been, traditionally and quite properly, retained for matters of substantial importance, and for orders involving increases in public charges. Many of the things on which directions might here be given will be quite minor, and quite apart from established precedents and keeping a sense of proportion, we feel that the negative procedure is sufficient. I hope, therefore, that the Committee will reject the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Colonel Gomme-Duncan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary says that there is very little between us on this matter. I think there is a great deal between us. Whatever the precedents may be, and whatever previous Governments did, there is far too much of the negative resolution procedure in the House. I hope that we shall have a better reason than the mere supposition on the part of the Minister that these things will not be of great importance. To the producer they will be of great importance, and the producer is a very important person in the country. I think that this is a very reasonable Amendment, and I hope that we shall hear more about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment negatived.</p>
	<p>Motion made, and Question proposed, "That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill."</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain Crookshank</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ought perhaps to have put down an Amendment on this point, but I should like some explanation of the relevance of and the relationship between Subsections (5) and (6), because
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
it seems to me that they ought to be redrafted. I am not sure that Subsection (6) adds anything to Subsection (5). Subsection (5) says that an Order may contain provisions revoking or varying a previous order. That is a quite simple proposition. But then Subsection (6) says that the Minister may at any time by order withdraw the whole or any part of a direction made to a board by virtue of such an order. As he already has the power to revoke or vary a previous order I cannot see why in the world he wants to do it all over again in Subsection (6). There may be some very good explanation, but if it is not necessary perhaps at some future stage the two Subsections could be amalgamated to make clear what they refer to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to the Clause as a whole, I think that we have had a very interesting discussion this morning, and while I believe the arguments put forward from this side of the Committee merit far more consideration by the Government than they have so far received, I trust that between now and the Report stage the Minister will look at them again. If the Minister can give an explanation of my little difficulty in regard to Subsections (5) and (6) I would be glad to hear it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think I should give to the Committee the explanation which the hon. Member has sought. Subsection (5) applies where the Minister, having made an order under Subsection (2), wishes for one reason or another to replace it wholly or partly by another order under Subsection (2). Subsection (5) gives the necessary power to revoke or vary the first order by the second one. This second order, because it is an order made under the powers in Subsection (2), has to go through all the procedure of Subsections (3) and (4) before the Minister can make it. I hope that is transparently clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (6) applies where the Minister wishes merely to withdraw the whole or part of a direction given by order under Subsection (2). If he proposes to withdraw the whole he may revoke the order. If he proposes to withdraw only part he may vary the order so far as is necessary in order to withdraw that part. There is no need for such an order to go through the procedure of Subsections (3) and (4).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Captain Crookshank</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not very clear to me and I suppose it is what would be prefaced by the words "Not a very good explanation, but good enough for Committee D," because it is nothing like clear to me what is the difference between the two. I shall study the Minister's reply, and I hope the Minister will also study what he had evidently seen only a short time before.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Colonel Gomme-Duncan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we leave the Clause I would like to ask a question on the relations between the board and the Minister. Has it been worked out what would happen when the tomato and cucumber boards in England and Scotland, to take an instance, have entirely different views of what should be done? What happens when the two Ministers disagree? That is a very important point. It is obvious that there are certain products which go to Scotland from England in very large quantities and which we in Scotland want to grow. It is well to be frank in this matter. What happens when the Minister for Agriculture in England says that he is going to send this, that, and the other, across the border to Scotland, and the Secretary for Scotland then says—as I hope he will—"Not at all, because our people are producing these things and I must protect their industry." This is a point which will arise and is on the way already. The Minister, I was glad to see, almost quoted the scathing Dr. Johnson to the Committee when he said that oats were food for men in Scotland and for horses in England. Boswell said "Where will you find such men and such horses?" Today both animals and men are superior in Scotland, and if the hon. Gentleman had gone to the Aberdeen Angus bull sales in Perth he would realise that they were superior.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Turton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Member kindly not suggest that shorthorns are national Scottish animals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Colonel Gomme-Duncan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not suggesting that, but one will always get the highest prices in the Perth sales. Those are the Scottish shorthorns. But I am on the verge of getting out of Order. I would like to hear from the Minister and from the Joint Under-Secretary of State for Scotland what they propose to do when they differ in their relations between the two countries. That is going to happen on certain occasions, and
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
whereas they may come to a friendly agreement, it is quite likely that they will differ. Then, I presume, something must be done to resolve the differences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In regard to the point made by hon. Gentlemen opposite with regard to publication of reports received by the Minister, I hope that the Minister will keep his promise to the Committee to look at this Subsection (4) when we reach the Report stage. Quite an important point was made by hon. Gentlemen opposite when they raised that issue. Many on both sides deprecate the tendency for much of our legislative business to be taken away from the Floor of the House to Committee. I want to re-emphasise the point that the Minister has made the promise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. T. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not quite follow my hon. Friend. Whether or not a report of a committee of investigation should be published or not has no relation to legislation. It certainly is not taking from Parliament any part or lot of then-duties. It is a mere question whether the report of the committee of investigation, apart from their conclusions, should be published. It is not a question of delegating legislation elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In regard to the question put by the hon. and gallant Member for Perth and Kinross, Perth (Colonel Gomme-Duncan) about what Ministers would do if they found themselves in disagreement, the question is not one which can be answered readily. I can say that there is no likelihood that Ministers will disagree on the lines indicated. We are too close to the marketing boards both here and in Scotland to allow disagreement to crop up. When the hon. Member reaches the stage at which he no longer wishes for English agricultural produce to go over the border to Scotland, I think he had better consult agricultural interests in Scotland about how much of their produce comes to England. I am pretty sure that he will find a ready made answer from producers of food in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Colonel Gomme-Duncan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I consulted the agriculturists in Scotland, being one myself. I am convinced that the Minister does not realise that the situation I have described may happen. Admittedly Scotland and England are very close together in the present Cabinet. And England always wins; that is a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1948-1949V003P0I0024">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
point we have noticed. We have to decide whether or not whether a given agricultural product should come in large quantities from England to Scotland or from Scotland to England.
