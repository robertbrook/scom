	<div class='title'>—(APPOINTMENT OF NOMINATED MEMBERS OF AGRICULTURAL LAND TRIBUNAL.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>Question proposed [	<i>9th February</i>], "That the Clause stand part of the Bill."</p>
	<p>Question again proposed. 10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frederick Peart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I was beginning to say the other day, I want to ask the Minister to give a much better explanation than was given on Tuesday. My hon. Friends pressed the Minister to give details, and he specifically mentioned rumours which had led to this change in the administrative procedure as the reason why we are now to have the Lord Chancellor's panel instead of arrangements put forward by the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The explanation given by the Minister is quite impossible to justify and he must give more details. He was pressed very strongly on this point and he put forward the rather strange argument:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There are some members of the public who do not take a particular interest in the details of the working of the machine."</p></blockquote>
Then he went on to argue that, because of that, the view was taken that the machinery was not independent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is very strange to argue that we should change administrative machinery to appease a body of opinion that is indifferent to the working of the Act in general and to this particular part of the machine. It is a very poor argument, and I hope that the Joint Parliamentary Secretary will respond to my invitation and give adequate reasons for the change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After all, the Minister on Tuesday, when arguing on another Amendment of which we disposed, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It would be most unwise to tamper with their composition when there is no earthly reason to do so."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee D,</i> 9th February, 1954; c. 96 and 83.]</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1928</span>
He was dealing with the position of the tribunals. Surely it is also right to argue that it is unwise to tamper with the administrative arrangements of the tribunal, because it is admitted by the Minister that they have worked successfully since the passing of the 1947 Act. I hope the Minister will give us a better case than that put forward on Tuesday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to have more details, and some indication of the sources of the rumours that were mentioned by the Minister. In practice, even if we have these new arrangements under the Lord Chancellor, it virtually means that the Lord Chancellor will have to take notice of the farmers and landowners put forward by their respective national organisations. It is only right that he should do so, and there will be no change in the personnel of the land tribunals. The old system of deciding from panels put forward by farmers' and landowners' organisations will be discontinued. Why change it, if it has worked well, simply to appease people who, on the Minister's own words, are actually indifferent to the machine? That is a strange argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Joint Parliamentary Secretary give us any volume of opinion in the agricultural world which has pressed for this change? I know there are people who dislike the whole machine, like the hon. Member for Orpington (Sir W. Smithers), who will, no doubt, make a very eloquent attack upon the Government today. What volume of opinion has there been in the agricultural world that has expressed the desire to make this alteration? I have never heard of any or seen it expressed in any responsible agricultural journal. Would the Joint Parliamentary Secretary in reply please give us an indication of what is happening?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened most carefully to the debate which took place on the Amendment, and I do not understand why there is this question about Clause 4. I thought that the case put up for incorporating in Clause 4 some rearrangement by which certain other people could take their place in the tribunals was reasonable. Obviously, as the Minister has so carefully pointed out, the purpose of Clause 4 is to divorce as far as possible the tribunals from the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I0972">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1929</span>
agricultural executive committees. As I see it, the Clause is designed to make the tribunals bodies which can carry out the specific job that they have to do without relation to the A.E.CS. The argument that was used—and I have to be very careful that I do not get out of order—did not hold water, particularly in view of the fact, as the Minister has told us—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the land tribunals are independent now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The change put forward is not to make a change in the position that the land tribunals are independent bodies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 4 does not alter the fact that they are independent tribunals, but hon. Gentlemen opposite wanted to alter the Clause in such a way that it could be said that the result was to make the tribunals perhaps slightly less independent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. E. L. Mallalieu</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. and learned Gentleman wants to interrupt me perhaps he will do so, and I will give way. I am skating on very thin ice from the point of view of order, and the hon. and learned Gentleman may find it extremely difficult to interrupt me without getting out of order himself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mallalieu</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How does the hon. Gentleman think that it will make the tribunals in any way more connected with the executive committees to have representatives on them of, for instance, the agricultural workers, than to have farmers on them, as indeed there are?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We have discussed this question 	<i>ad nauseam,</i> and we must discuss the Question, "That the Clause stand part of the Bill."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take it that the hon. Member has now fallen through the ice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1930</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to have transgressed the Rules of Order. The points put by hon. Gentlemen opposite on Clause 4 are in another form simply a continuation of the arguments that were used when we were earlier discussing the Amendment. I am quite satisfied with the arguments that have been put forward at length and in detail by the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They were not put forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it is my lack of ability to understand hon. Gentlemen opposite, but it would be very interesting to hear from the right hon. Gentleman something a little more convincing than has yet been put up, to warrant any further discussion of this Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It so happens that I am not responsible, or, indeed, deeply interested in the speedy passage of the Bill. As by inviting me to speak on the subject, the Government side clearly are not either, I am quite willing to respond.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman cannot have it both ways. Time and again he has accused us of not being interested, and, just because somebody says something, he says that it is the Government's business to get the Bill through, and that "if they are not interested in getting it through, I will answer the invitation or challenge that has been thrown out."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is quite wrong. It is the duty of any Opposition to seek to have it both ways, and on this argument it is very simple for us to have it both ways. The point I was on was not the hon. Gentleman's speech, because we were delighted to have him intervene. I do not think the Government should be so interested in speed that they should continue to gag all their Members as they have done so successfully since the Committee stage started. When it comes to the Government side deliberately inciting the modest and retiring Members on this side of the Committee to take part, that is a different matter. It is an unusual practice from the Government side, but I am delighted to respond in a friendly sort of way. I am sorry that my friendliness should have made the hon. Member for Yarmouth (Mr. Fell) feel a little uncomfortable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I0973">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1931</span>
The hon. Gentleman has got it all wrong. To understand this sort of thing one has to know what has gone before. A lot of water has gone over the dam on this whole subject, and if one is not 	<i>au fait</i> with it, it is difficult to be quite clear about the picture. So far as I understand the proposed change, nothing is happening to make the agricultural land tribunals either more or less connected with the A.E.Cs. than before. They have never been connected with them. Let us be quite clear about it. It is important, and, in a very large measure, that is an answer to the case which the hon. Member for Orpington (Sir W. Smithers) develops. It is an important principle that these agricultural land tribunals should be seen to be quite independent of the agricultural executive committees, who have the original work to do. I am sure that is so and that the change here is not directed to that principle at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed change is intended simply to re-emphasise that independence. The chairman of the panel, himself having been appointed by the Lord Chancellor, shall in future select the members of the committee who sit with him on a case, rather than have the Minister appointing the assessors to sit with him. The panels of assessors themselves shall in future be drawn up by the Lord Chancellor's office and not by the Minister's office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When this point was discussed on Second Reading, I was not clear what the Joint Parliamentary Secretary was telling us. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I think the right hon. Gentleman had no comment to make about the fact that the Lord Chancellor will now make the appointments of the other members."</p></blockquote>
I intervened to ask:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Lord Chancellor or the Chairman?"</p></blockquote>
The Joint Parliamentary Secretary went on to say
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Lord Chancellor will, in name, be making the appointments, as opposed to my night hon. Friend who has been making them up to the present."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 19th January, 1954; Vol. 522, c. 928.]</p></blockquote>
I understand that that is not exactly the position, and that the only appointment that the Lord Chancellor makes is that of the chairman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1932</span>
That he always has done under our original Bill. His new function is to receive from the nominating bodies the panels of people from whom the assessors are to be drawn, subject to his power to add to that list if he thinks the people have not put up enough names on a particular occasion. His function, therefore, is limited—at least I hope it is limited—to compiling a panel of nominees from the list submitted to him by the nominating bodies from which individual courts are to be drawn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is most important that that should remain so. I do not think it really matters whether the Lord Chancellor or the Minister receives the list and compiles it—that is a small point—but what is important is that if the farmer or the landlord who is liable to be dispossessed is to be assured of a fair deal by the tribunal, the National Farmers' Union and the C.L.A.—leaving out the point about the workers—shall not, in fact, be the bodies which submit assessors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we draw our assessors from outside on other lists, then the whole basis on which the tribunals are allowed to develop their prestige and authority will go. Therefore, I should like the Joint Parliamentary Secretary to make it quite clear that the interpretation of what he said on Second Reading is, in fact, that the Lord Chancellor compiles the list, but the authority for making the nominations will still rest with the nominating bodies, and that the two gentlemen he nominates will be taken off their list as heretofor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point which we want to get clear is this. As I read the Bill—and this is the point on which I interrupted the hon. Gentleman, concerning which he gave a rather confusing answer—even if the Lord Chancellor and not the Minister of Agriculture, is now responsible for compiling the panels, the man responsible for selecting each individual court is the chairman. That is why I asked the hon. Gentleman whether it was the Lord Chancellor or the Chairman. The Joint Parliamentary Secretary replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Lord Chancellor will in name be making the appointments."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 19th January, 1954; Vol. 522, c. 928.]</p></blockquote>
As I understand it, the effective making of the appointment is when we take a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I0974">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1933</span>
man's name from the panel and appoint him to hear a particular case. Until then, he is merely one of a panel. As I understand the Bill, it is the chairman who selects the name of the farmer and of the landlord to sit with him as his assessors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I confess that that does not altogether please me. The Solicitor-General is with us, and he might like to hear the argument. I am always the layman and practical man, and I am very worried and suspicious when too much power gets into the hands of lawyers. To have a chairman of the tribunal, who is a lawyer of several years' standing, may be a good thing for the chairman, but if that man is not only to be the chairman, but is also to pick his own assessors from the panel, then I get a bit worried.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have sat on many panels of assessors, mostly to do with the Ministry of Labour, in the old days, but also to do with other Departments, and I do not think that I have yet sat on one where the decision as to who has to sit with him was left to the chairman. I can think of many chairmen, particularly legal chairmen—and in my experience, legal chairmen of tribunals are apt to be the least successful lawyers in the courts—with whom it has been my duty, as I conceived it, to cross swords and to stand up for my point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that in many of these appeals, the chairmen if they had had the right to decide on their own assessors, would not have chosen me to sit with them. Since, in those cases, I was representing the trade unions members, I think that my trade union members would have been less happy about the impartiality of the tribunal if they had known that their representative was chosen, not because it was known that he was a pretty good defender of their interests, but because the chairmen thought that he was a pliable, easy to get along with instrument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what could happen here, and a determined chairman wanting his own way, and perhaps having his own view about the set-up of all this, having to choose a farmer or landlord from panels is not at all likely to choose the chap who is gong to make for awkward and long hearings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1934</span>
This will not happen in many cases. The chairman will simply say to the clerk of the court: "You do this." That will be done in many cases, but in some cases it can happen the other way round. We are not moving to strike this out, because it is a matter on which the Government must bear future responsibility, but I say to the hon. Member for Orpington that any number of farmers are concerned about this, and even if I do not share their general case—and I told the Rev. E. A. Marsh this the other night—nevertheless, I am quite certain that they ought not to acquiesce In any weakening of the present protective device in the Act. I believe that taking this power of appointment of the farmers' assessors out of the Minister's hands and giving it to the Lord Chancellor, in the first place, and to a legal chairman, in the second place, is decidedly not a strengthening, but a weakening of the present position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Joint Parliamentary Secretary to comment on that in general. We leave it to him in the end to decide what he wants to do, and to make it clear if my interpretation of the appointment is correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Waldron Smithers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister tell the Committee if it is possible for a member of the county executive committee, who has been a party to dispossessing a farmer, also to be on the land tribunal?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gooch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to add a few words to what I have already said in the form of a plea to the Joint Parliamentary Secretary to have another look at this matter, and perhaps to put down a new Amendment on the Report stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two points which I want to stress. The hon. Member for Orpington (Sir W. Smithers) has raised a point which I know from practical experience has not happened and is not likely to happen. The men on the tribunals should be strictly independent. The point I put to the Joint Parliamentary Secretary is that in the whole of the set-up under the 1947 Agricultural Act, the appointment of committees, has always been done on a representative basis of nomination. The three partners in the industry were invited to supply nominations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I0975">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1935</span>
That principle has been carried through the whole of the operations of the county agricultural committees. When it comes to a question of granting certificates for tied cottages, the tribunal consists of an independent chairman, farmer and worker. That principle has always been adopted, and I cannot see why there should be a departure from it under present conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point which I want to make is that when a farmer appeals against a threat of dispossession, he is not the only man on the farm concerned. The farm workers are concerned—their livelihood is at stake—and I think that the Joint Parliamentary Secretary should address himself to that point. The main point is that he should recognise the people who are the real partners in the industry, and enable them to share in running a concern in which they are rightly interested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture (Mr. G. R. H. Nugent)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One or two points have been put to me, particularly by the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Peart), about the basis upon which my right hon. Friend has come to propose this legislation. I think it has been common knowledge that quite a considerable volume of public opinion, as opposed to agricultural opinion, has been concerned about the operation and the structure of these agricultural tribunals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that my right hon. Friend has already met the point—as the hon. Member for Workington implied—that agricultural opinion is satisfied that the tribunals work well and fearlessly, and that they are completely independent. Nevertheless, we have to consider the whole body of public opinion, including that of my hon. Friend the Member for Orpington (Sir W. Smithers).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Now the cat is out of the bag.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nugent</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no doubt that there are considerable sections of public opinion which are not familiar with the workings of the agricultural world or of these tribunals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They have not expressed any views on it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1936</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nugent</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They have on many occasions, and I have met them at a number of public meetings. My right hon. Friend has, therefore, thought it wise to ensure that these tribunals should not only continue to operate fairly to dispense justice, but should also be seen to be justly set up. That is the practical point. My right hon. Friend is a party to all these appeals before the tribunal. He is bound to be a party because he is interested in every decision made by the A.E.C. Therefore, so long as he appointed these two members to the tribunal, there obviously was a possibility that those not familiar with the general working of the system might say that the Minister had put on members who were interested in the case and were, therefore, not impartial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The change proposed here—and I now come to the questions asked by the right hon. Member for Belper (Mr. G. Brown)—is that the panels from which the farmers, on the one hand, and the landowners, on the other, are drawn should be compiled by the Lord Chancellor. If I seemed to be confusing the issue on the Second Reading, I apologise. I think that it is quite plain in the Schedule that the Lord Chancellor shall select the names. The Schedule reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the persons to be placed on either panel shall be selected by the Lord Chancellor from nominations made at his request by persons appearing to him to represent the interests of farmers or of owners of agricultural land, as the case may be."</p></blockquote>
So the Lord Chancellor has the specific responsibility of compiling these panels and will undoubtedly consult the C.L.A. and the N.F.U. for names in the same way as my right hon. Friend has done up to now. In the last paragraph of the Schedule, the Lord Chancellor has reserved to him the right of making a selection from names outside that sphere if he considers it desirable, and if he is not satisfied that he has names as required from the lists submitted to him. The effect is to make it perfectly plain that my right hon. Friend has in no way influenced the view of the tribunal by appointing members who might be interested in his views. We all know that my right hon. Friend has never done so, but this ensures not only that justice is done, but that it appears to be done. I am sure the Committee will recognise the soundness of this view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I0976">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1937</span>
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is correct, as the right hon. Gentleman said, that the chairman will nominate two members of the tribunal. The Schedule says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The two members of an Agricultural Land Tribunal other than the chairman shall, for each reference to the Tribunal, be nominated by the chairman…."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, although the Lord Chancellor selects the names for the panels, it is the chairman who finally names the two people who sit with him for any particular occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman said that the legal chairman of a tribunal is likely to be the least successful of lawyers in the courts. I feel sure that he did not intend that as a reference to the general working of the tribunals. We have all recognised that their chairmen have been particularly successful in doing a difficult job, and that by all concerned they have been recognised as doing it impartially and efficiently in the general interests of justice and of the industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree that far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nugent</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly could not accept a reflection of that kind on the chairmen of the tribunals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are doing is not weakening the position of the tribunals but is, I am certain, strengthening it. The members selected will still have their particular value, not only in their expert knowledge, but in being drawn from sections of the industry which might be aggrieved by the way that a decision goes. Therefore, the tribunals are designed in a way which will continue to carry the necessary confidence. It is most important that we should carry public opinion with us and should satisfy the nation generally that these tribunals are completely fair and independent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why my right hon Friend has brought forward the three new Clauses, all designed with the same end, not so much to strengthen the operation of the tribunals as, more particularly in this Clause, to establish beyond any doubt that both in operation and appearance the tribunal is a completely independent body. I hope the Committee will now be satisfied that this is a wise step and one which will operate in the general interests of the working of the tribunals,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1938</span>
and that hon. Members will be prepared to approve the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"Incidentally, since I have taken this matter up, I did not previously realise how many people there are with the attributes of Pontius Pilate."</p></blockquote>
We are dealing with something which affects the landowners and, as the Conservative Party is closely connected with them, it is quite natural that the Joint Parliamentary Secretary and his right hon. Friend would hear their views from time to time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am reminded also of the debates in the House yesterday. In one of them we were discussing a Bill which is to confer public money to this basic industry, with which we are all concerned. Later, we had another debate on an agreement which exposed other basic industries to the free competition of the world. I suggest that we as a Parliamentary Committee must take into consideration the views of great sections of public opinion which may not be allied to the Country Landowners' Association.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Joseph Slater</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Joint Parliamentary Secretary laid great emphasis upon public opinion. I am beginning to think that if an assessment of public opinion were taken regarding the setting up of the tribunals, it would go against the attitude of the Minister. I cannot understand why preferential treatment should be given to two classes, the land owners and the farmers. We are dealing with a basic industry, and the farm worker inside that industry has as much interest in its progress as the land owner or even the farmer. Why has the Minister arrived at the position in which in the only two lists to be drafted, and from which people can be drawn as assessors.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I0977">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1939</span>
the names should come from the land owners and the farmers, and not from the agricultural workers? All three parties are interested, quite apart from the general public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. A. J. Champion</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little worried by the wording of the First Schedule, to which the Joint Parliamentary Secretary has continually referred. I understood him to say that the chairman of the tribunal would make a selection from the panel which had been prepared by the Lord Chancellor, who had selected and placed on the panel names from nominations made by two bodies. The Schedule says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The two members… shall, for each reference to the tribunal, be nominated by the chairman…"</p></blockquote>
I wonder why the word "nominated" is used if it means that the chairman is to select? I know that this will be dealt with to some extent when we discuss the Schedule, but we cannot argue the Clause without reference to the Schedule. The legal terminology might be quite good, but there seems to me to be a difference between "select" and "nominate." Elsewhere, the word "select" is used in one case and "nominations" in another, which appears to indicate some significance in the two words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mallalieu</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The burden of the first part of the speech from the Joint Parliamentary Secretary was to the effect that public opinion—he particularly stressed farming opinion—was satisfied with the tribunals. That may well be true. His argument was, therefore, that since public opinion and farming opinion was satisfied, it was best to leave the tribunals alone. But by the Clause the Minister is altering the tribunals in a special and important way. This had not occurred to me before my right hon. Friend the Member for Belper (Mr. G. Brown) spoke, but, having heard my right hon. Friend, I think that the Committee would be well advised seriously to consider the whole matter again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to the nomination by the chairman of his two assessors or colleagues. That is something not only about which the hon. Member for Orpington (Sir W. Smithers) will want to say a word, but which concerns all people who want to
	<span class='label label-info column'>1940</span>
see that justice is done. When we suggested altering the composition of the tribunal by the inclusion of an agricultural worker, we were told that the tribunals had worked well and were asked "Why change them?" Here, however, the Government are changing the tribunals by allowing a chairman to nominate his own colleagues or assessors, or whatever they are called.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have the greatest respect for those chairmen whose work I have seen. I agree with the Joint Parliamentary Secretary that on the whole they have done very good work and are excellent men for the job. But they are human beings, and if they are to have people sitting beside them who will prolong their work by raising awkward questions—on behalf of a farmer, perhaps, who is alleged to be inefficient—naturally a chairman would not select those people for the next hearing but would say "Away with these men. I will have Mr. A, who keeps quiet and docile and does what I want."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be thought that I am telling tales out of school, but I have heard these people talking and I know how human they are. It is, obviously, a sincere temptation, even to a sincere and hardworking chairman, to have someone sitting beside him who does more or less what he wants him to do. Do not forget that the chairman will be present at every hearing and is, therefore, the pivot around whom the tribunal revolves. He will be able to set the tone, and having set the tone of the decisions of his tribunal, is it human that he would allow somebody whom he regards as a nuisance or busybody to upset that tone? I do not think so. This is a serious objection and I hope that the Minister will consider the proposal again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might well be asked why the Lord Chancellor and his staff should be burdened every time with making the selection. In that case, let it be done in alphabetical order, in rota, because I am sure that the Lord Chancellor would not include anyone on the panel who was not fit to serve. Why have preference for one person against another on the panel? Let it be done in alphabetical or any other regular order by which the Lord Chancellor can be saved the bother of making nominations on every occasion, if that is the difficulty.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I0978">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1941</span>
Whatever the difficulty, this is a serious point, which should be dealt with, and I hope that at the appropriate stage the Minister, having reconsidered the matter, will find some other way than laying these tribunals, whose work we can all approve, open to the charge that the chairman can perhaps rig them in favour of his own point of view in the nominating of his assessors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General (Sir Reginald Manningham-Buller)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may answer the question of the hon. Member for Derbyshire, South-East (Mr. Champion) on the drafting of the First Schedule. It is purely a matter of English, but I think it is correct to use the word "nominated" in paragraph (1) and to use "select" when dealing with the constitution of the panel. The persons who are to go on the panel will be selected, and from the panel individuals are to be nominated for a particular reference. This is in accordance with precedent, for in the 1947 Act there is a reference to "nominated members."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a way they do, Sir Austin, and yet the principle in the second Amendment is a little different. I am, however, prepared to argue the Amendments together, and we can leave the separate issues to be raised on the Motion, "That the Clause stand part of the Bill."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first of these two Amendments arises from our doubts as far as the Minister is concerned. Incidentally, we are getting somewhat accustomed to
	<span class='label label-info column'>1942</span>
Committee Sittings without the Minister's attendance. We have concluded one such Sitting, and now we have another. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman does not absent himself regularly, because this is becoming tiresome. One wants to address ideas to the Minister, relying on him to consider them. Parliamentary Secretaries, we all know—this is no reflection on the hon. Gentleman—are limited by instructions: they do not have the discretion of a Minister. It is a little tiresome having continually to address our ideas to an empty chair, knowing that as the Minister is not here they will not be considered. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will decide to favour our Committee with his presence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is that we think that the Minister has not achieved the purpose he has in mind. The Joint Parliamentary Secretary will say, quite rightly, that there has been a lot of criticism, particularly among farmers, but also among the members of county agricultural committees, that difficulty and uncertainty is arising because it is possible for a man to be put in jeopardy again and again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A case goes to the A.E.C., is argued before the estate or husbandry committee, is argued before the full committee. A decision is taken. It then goes to the tribunal, is argued again, is inspected again. Finally, after long delay, a decision is taken, and then, in the following year, the process starts all over again. Since there was laid down in the original Act a special requirement as to when the original notice must be given, it means that there is virtually no break, because the second notice is served almost as soon as the first process is completed. That is worrying people considerably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister has just come in, may I digress again, Sir Austin, to say that many times I have been accused of prescience and power, but I have never known anything quite so swift as the right hon. Gentleman materialising in answer to my spirited protest of a few moments ago. However, I am glad that it reached his ears and brought him here so quickly. I am only sorry that I did not speak sooner. We are delighted to see the right hon. Gentleman and, for his benefit, I will repeat what I was saying, that we find it difficult to conduct
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I0979">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1943</span>
our proceedings without him. I said that politely, as I always do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I was saying, there is this long delay, and then the process starts all over again and can go on year after year with never a break. That is the criticism and that is all there is to it, although it is a great all. The Minister has sought to meet it in this Clause by giving the tribunal power to order costs. On Second Reading, we suggested that a more simple and less dangerous way of doing this would be to give the tribunal power to make its decision run for a longer period than on the year to year basis. For instance, we could give it power to cover a period of three years where that seemed right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Assuming that there is some technical reason why that cannot be done—we shall be glad to hear it in that case—I agree that the power to award costs is an alternative, but it seems to my hon. Friends and myself that this power must be taken in such a way that we are sure it will be used for this purpose. As this Clause is drawn the tribunal may, where it appears to them that there are special reasons for doing so, order costs against any person concerned. This may mean the person responsible for bringing the case again and again or simply the chap who is defending himself, who may have got across the tribunal because they thought the argument frivolous. So those costs can be ordered to be paid to anybody else. It becomes a penal Clause, altogether different from the purpose which the Minister declared he had in mind. It is much wider, not directed to this one point at all, and we take the view that it is a dangerous provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Solicitor-General was on the original Committee and took a great interest in this matter. The desire of everybody at that time was that this appeal machinery should be as easily and cheaply accessible as possible to everybody concerned. In so far as there was any difference between the two sides of the Committee at that time, the then Opposition wondered whether it was sufficiently easily accessible. I am afraid that this will tighten it up and will introduce an additional element. almost of blackmail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will mean that the small man, defending himself in a case where the A.E.C. is not an initiator—for example
	<span class='label label-info column'>1944</span>
the application of a landlord for notice to quit—may become frightened. This sort of case might occur. In Wales where the small tenant farmer is a first-class farmer, but similar to the ordinary run of unskilled workers in this country, he will not have the great knowledge which a bigger farmer might be expected to acquire like any other businessman. That chap may be told by his landlord, as he is at the moment, "If you oppose this, it will be difficult for you." But, in addition, under this Clause the landlord could say, "If you oppose it, you will run the risk of costs which may be hundreds of pounds."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no good the Solicitor-General saying here in this Committee that the costs would not run into hundreds of pounds because we all know that in an isolated country area many people can be laid on by an influential landlord to convey that impression. In Derbyshire we have one or two influential landlords. Some are very good, but one or two have in the past put all kinds of pressure upon tenants about how difficult it will be for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Clause puts an additional weapon in their hands. If, however, it were to be drawn in such a way that it could not be used against the tenant defending himself; if it could be drawn in such a way that it is clearly directed only at the person whom the tribunal honestly think has been bringing the case to them too often, and ought to be discouraged from doing so, that difficulty could not arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am prepared to be told, as Oppositions are told by every Ministerial Front Bench, that the words of our Amendment are not quite right. I am prepared to be told that some other words would be better, but it seems to us that our words achieve this limiting and direct approach which the wide open Clause of the Minister does not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall be interested to hear the argument because this is an important matter. If we are wrong, we are open to be told, but I beg hon. and right hon. Gentlemen opposite to treat this matter seriously. It could well be that in legislating for a good purpose here we ended by imposing a considerably additional disability. We want to be very careful about that and, unless we get a satisfactory answer, I hope that we shall be supported strongly by hon. Gentlemen opposite.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I0980">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1945</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman began by saying that either landlords or tenants may be put in jeopardy of repeated and renewed applications which are vexatious and perhaps frivolous in character. At least I am glad that we start with the recognition that, as the position now stands, there may be vexatious and frivolous applications. Where I part company with the right hon. Gentleman is in thinking that the provisions of this Clause put an additional weapon into the hands of landlords or, indeed, into the hands of any party to the reference, because they do not. This Clause merely gives power to the tribunal to make an order for costs where there are special reasons for doing so. The tribunal will not have power in law to make such an order where there are not special reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman said that what he had in mind was a constant repetition which ought to be prevented. He suggested that whatever award was made should endure for a period, but that would not stop constant applications to the tribunal. The difficulty about using the word "repetition" means that it must be the repetition of what has gone before. There can be applications to these tribunals for a variety of matters, and one must consider the possibility that there may be very vexatious conduct through an application being made at one time for one thing and the next application being made in reference to another subject, with the same parties to the reference to the tribunal, while the third application might be in relation to some other matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It could not then be said that there was a repetition of the same application. There would be the same applicant but not a repetition of the same application. Therefore if we accepted the Amendment it would mean that in the case I have illustrated, while we might all agree that it was vexatious conduct. the tribunal would have no power to make any award for costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the Clause is that we may get a case which, by its nature, appears at the outset to be oppressive, vexatious or frivolous but is it not right, when there is an application by a landlord of that character, that the tribunal should have power to impose the burden on him of paying the costs of the farmer? I should
	<span class='label label-info column'>1946</span>
have thought that hon. Gentlemen opposite would welcome that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now let us take the case where the same landlord makes a series of applications for different matters—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Such as?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Such as the reference against the refusal of a certificate of bad husbandry or a refusal against consent for notice to quit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On one or the other?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May be, but repetition would not cover two applications of different kinds. We feel that there is a strong case for giving to the tribunal—not to the landlord and not to the tenant—power in their discretion where there are special reasons, and only there, to impose the burden of costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I put a point on the question of separate applications on different grounds not being covered by repetition, and an application for consent to serve a notice to quit which originates with the landlord? The second ground he gives, namely, the refusal to grant a certificate of husbandry is surely a separate issue. It does not originate in the same way, and would not get to a tribunal a second time because the committee would initiate it. Therefore the only possibility of repetition would be if the landlord initiated the same thing twice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if the right hon. Gentleman has not followed my argument. Surely, the landlord can instigate proceedings either to get a notice to quit or a certificate of bad husbandry. We wish to prevent continued applications of that kind which are of a vexatious or frivolous character.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Clause as drafted, a tribunal is armed with power to discourage such conduct. I should have thought that hon. Gentlemen opposite would have welcomed that. But the effect of their Amendment would be to cut down the operation of this Clause. No matter how vexatious and frivolous were the applications, there would be no power of awarding costs against, for instance, the landlord, unless he had made the same application twice. I think that is wrong,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I0981">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1947</span>
and that power should be left in the hands of the tribunals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that it is a point of some importance, but I cannot agree with the right hon. Gentleman that an individual tenant, who is the respondent in proceedings initiated by the landlord, and who is reasonable in his conduct, could ever be treated as a vexatious litigant. I cannot think of a defendant in the High Court ever having been regarded as a vexatious litigant. It is often the plaintiff who may be regarded in such a light. Surely tribunals should have the power to impose this sanction if claims are brought before them where special reasons exist for imposing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason we feel it right to leave this wide power to tribunals rather than to limit it as is suggested by the Amendment. I think that perhaps the right hon. Gentleman has made this suggestion without appreciating the reason why we seek to retain this wider power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cledwyn Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the Solicitor-General has met in full the arguments advanced by my right hon. Friend. I agree with my right hon. Friend that this Clause will provide unscrupulous landlords with a formidable weapon against tenant farmers. There is no doubt that many tenant farmers are afraid of the processes of the law, and of becoming involved in litigation, with the possibility of costs being awarded against them. That is a natural fear, and is not confined to tenant farmers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A landlord could operate the provisions of this Clause to attain his ends. Hon. Members are aware that such things have happened in other cases. For example, tenants who might have sought the protection of the Rent Acts have relinquished possession of their houses rather than appear in the county court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In spite of what the Solicitor-General has said, I think that the wording of this Clause is dangerously wide, and that the words "special reasons" are especially capable of grave misinterpretation. What do they mean? What will they ultimately be interpreted to mean? The hon. and learned Gentleman may say now that they mean such and such a thing, but after a few years, when several tribunals have discussed the matter, they may be interpreted differently. There will be disparity between what tribunals in different parts of the country consider to be special
	<span class='label label-info column'>1948</span>
reasons, and that sort of thing does not make for justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidentally, the words "special reason "have an unfortunate connotation. They have a very significant meaning for lawyers dealing with cases of motoring offences. I shudder to think what will happen if this Clause is accepted by the Committee. During the last few years, the Lord Chief Justice has spent half his time deciding exactly what is meant by these words "special reasons."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He has not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. C. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are asked by the Government to accept a Clause containing these words, but I think that the Amendment of my right hon. Friend is far wiser and will attain the desired end without any danger of misinterpretation. I hope that on consideration the Minister will decide that it will be far better, and more just, to accept the Amendment than to allow the Clause to remain as it is drafted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archer Baldwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After what has been said by the hon. Member for Anglesey (Mr. C. Hughes) I feel sure that I shall obtain his support for an Amendment, which I hope to move later to try to stop the fear of costs deterring anyone from taking proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome this Clause because unnecessary and unjustifiable claims are made to county executive committees, and eventually to land tribunals. People should be deterred from making such claims which cause a great deal of work and lead to much expense. I am not satisfied that the wording is altogether good, and it might be improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am against the Amendment, because it may not be a matter of repetition at all. It may well be that the initial claim of the landlord or the tenant is completely unjustified and I wish to see it made possibe for a land tribunal to award costs against an appellant who makes such a claim, even in the first instance. The Solicitor-General has said that a claim may be varied in such a way that it cannot be held to be repetition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The kind of repetition we must try to avoid is, for example, where a landlord continually serves a notice to quit on a tenant. I know that has happened, and I am glad to see that that sort of thing will be discouraged. It may be that the tenant
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I0982">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1949</span>
is unreasonable and makes unjustifiable claims upon his landlord, with reference to buildings and repairs and so on, and what is right for one should also be right for the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to see words inserted into the Clause to the effect that when it appears that either of the parties have made unjustifiable claims, costs may be awarded against such claimants, including the costs of appeal. I am not sure whether this subsection covers the awarding of costs in the county court and the High Court. Perhaps we may have that point cleared up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not care for the words "special reasons," and I think that some clearer term should be used. I consider that the power contained in the Clause should be left as wide as possible. After all, we appoint men of honour and common sense to serve on land tribunals, and I do not think they would be influenced unnecessarily. It should be left to their good judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not very disturbed by the heartrending accounts of farmers in the Welsh hills who are dominated by their landlords. I do not know what happens in Derbyshire, but I have had experience in Wales, and I have not yet found farmers there to be very much afraid of their landlords.

Could not we arrive at some form of words between
	<span class='label label-info column'>1950</span>
now and the Report stage which would cover that point? In my submission, in spite of what the Solicitor-General has said, the terms of the Clause are still too wide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tribunals can award costs for "special reasons." What on earth are the special reasons to be? A tribunal may have a discretion as to costs, like the ordinary courts, but these courts have precedents to go on, and centuries of experience are collected up in those precedents. These tribunals have virtually no experience, and in any case reports of their proceedings are very hard to come by. Uniformity of practice has been a very slender thing indeed. I cannot imagine a single reason upon which the tribunal could not award costs, under the words of the Clause. It is hard to think of any. What is a "special reason"? Is the colour of the farmer's face a special reason? I know that is carrying it to an absurdity, but it might be so. What do the words mean?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The object of our Amendment is to limit the award of costs to cases where vexatious, oppressive or frivolous proceedings have been brought. I cannot imagine any case in which it would be proper to award costs where there had not been some such proceedings covered under one of those three headings. To allow the award of costs against the farmer is, in any event, persecution because of the blackmailing effect that that would have before the proceedings started.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In criminal cases it is possible for the courts to award costs against an accused person, particularly where, first of all, the accused person is not only guilty but his whole course of conduct has involved the machinery of the State in considerable expense. One can think of cases of public mischief, and so on. That is perfectly proper. Cases with which we are dealing are very far from being criminal. The last thing we should wish to do is to give the impression to the farming community: "Here is an individual member of the community with only his own pockets to draw upon against some mighty outside power," possibly that of the State, since power is given to the Minister to intervene.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no exaggeration to say that a farmer may find himself up against the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I0983">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1951</span>
power of the State, financially speaking. Surely, that is entirely wrong. We should try to find some form of words which will prevent costs being awarded against somebody, particularly the farmer, unless there have been some sort of vexatious, oppressive or frivolous proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot imagine a case where it would be proper to award costs against the farmer, although the hon. Member for Leominster (Mr. Baldwin) seemed to think that there were such cases. This is not a criminal matter. It may be a question of neglect, sickness or old age, but not of criminal intent, and where there is no criminal intent there should not be criminal penalties. I hope that the Government will try to do something between now and the next appropriate stage to see that costs should only be awarded against the prosecution, so to speak, and never against the farmer, and that should be only in cases of frivolous, oppressive or vexatious proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has been interesting to listen to the debate and to note the divergence of view as to whether the present words are too wide or too narrow. I think there is agreement on all sides of the Committee on one thing, and that is on the main reason why the words "special reasons" are there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one wants costs to be awarded automatically in relation to each one of these references. In civil actions, costs usually follow the event. We do not want that to happen here. We do not want every application, if successful, to be accompanied by an award of costs. That is the original reason for the insertion of the words "special reasons". I think we are on completely common ground there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Brigg (Mr. E. L. Mallalieu) expressed the view that the phrase "special reasons" would cover anything, including the colour of the farmer's face and his political outlook.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are usually different colours.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know they are. I disagree with the hon. and learned Member for Brigg. Our words are limiting words. We have to find something which is quite special and out of the ordinary run of cases before there is any power on the part of the tribunal to
	<span class='label label-info column'>1952</span>
award costs. If the tribunal likes to take the matter into its hands and say: "We are prepared to treat this as a special reason and award costs," it would be possible I think, as I am at present advised, for the exercise of that jurisdiction to be challenged in the High Court by the appropriate proceedings. The words "special reasons" are really words of limitation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am prepared to look at the words again to see whether we can find a better phrase. I am inclined to feel that they are a little too narrow—not too wide—to achieve what hon. Gentlemen and right hon. Gentlemen opposite want and what we are seeking to achieve. We want to stop one party from being oppressed by continued proceedings—I avoid the use of the word "repetition"—and we want to give the tribunal power to stop this sort of thing: a man being taken up to the door of the court in which the tribunal is sitting only to find that the other side has abandoned its appeal the day before. We want to give the tribunals the power to award costs against, for instance, an executive committee, where the executive committee have done something particularly wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be argued: "We admit that all this sort of thing has taken place, but it still does not constitute a special reason for awarding costs." So I would like to look at the words again. I cannot give any undertaking that we will alter the wording but I undertake to consider it most carefully, with the point in mind that we want to avoid any regular practice developing of costs being awarded on these appeals; and at the same time one wants to leave the tribunal with power to penalise by the imposition of costs conduct which is vexatious, frivolous or oppressive, whether that conduct is revealed in the first instance or by continued applications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to the hon. Member for Anglesey (Mr. C. Hughes), I do not believe that tenants and farmers would in these days be deterred by threats by a landowner that the tribunal would award costs. They would only have to get advice, and there are plenty of good solicitors in Wales who would be only too willing to give them advice on that point. I do not think that is a very real case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I0984">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1953</span>
Perhaps, on that understanding, the right hon. Gentleman would consider withdrawing his Amendment. I will consider it carefully, although I do not promise to find a better form of words. It may be that after consideration of alternative words one may come to the conclusion that these words are the most satisfactory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mallalieu</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In his own inimitable way the Solicitor-General has tried to meet us on this point, but he did not deal with the point that I made about farmers not having costs awarded against them. Can he conceive of a case where it would be proper for the defendant to have costs awarded against him on the grounds of the proceedings having been brought? He has not brought them. Will the Solicitor-General consider very seriously making it impossible to award costs against farmers against whom proceedings have been brought?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I indicated earlier on, and I think that the hon. and learned Gentleman adopted my argument in what he has just said, that I had not personally had much experience of cases of vexatious defendants. Annoying defendants, yes, but not vexatious. There is something to be said for not tilting the scale against one party more than the other and of leaving discretion to the tribunal, subject to proper limitations. I would rather concentrate on trying to find words conveying proper limitations rather than words which seek to tilt the scale against one side or the other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. P. Bartley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was glad to hear the Solicitor-General say that he would look at the words again. I felt that our Amendment was too narrow in referring to the repetition of cases. I hope that the Solicitor-General will bear in mind the kind of case which arises in the coalfields, against sub-tenant farmers. Sometimes the National Coal Board may have to serve a notice upon a landlord that the coal resources in a particular place have been exhausted, and it may result in a notice to quit being served upon a sub-tenant farmer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case has to be considered by the land tribunal, but only on agricultural grounds. There are no agricultural grounds in such cases. The grounds are purely economic and are related to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1954</span>
fact that coal resources have been exhausted in the vicinity of the farm. I would like the Solicitor-General to take account of this fact, and to provide for the imposition of costs when a farmer has been brought before a tribunal in that kind of case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nobody will be surprised that we appreciated the second speech of the Solicitor-General much more than we did his first, because arguments do tell in our Committees, despite the political temper in which we live. I am glad that the Solicitor-General will look at this matter again. I gather that the purpose that the Government have in mind is generally the same as ours, namely that the continued use of these processes, with all the attendant unpleasant effects on the fellows concerned—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not necessarily. I would not limit it to continued use. We might have an initial proceeding by a landlord which would in itself be vexatious, frivolous or oppressive, and the tribunal should have power to penalise the landlord even if it is his first application.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There were some "Hear, hears" on this side of the Committee. Quite firmly, I cannot "Hear, hear" at all. I am worried about this point. If costs oan be applied against the landlord on the first occasion, they can be applied against other parties on the first occasion. The power to penalise on the first occasion is very dangerous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us be frank. Let me say something that will not gain me any political plaudits at all in the countryside. If farming is to become really efficient in this country, landlords ought in many cases to be making more use of their functions and duties as landlords rather than less. If we are to get this position dealt with there is scope for many more applications for consent to notices to quit than we now get. One of the difficulties about maintaining the landlord-tenant relationship in this country is that in many cases landlords prefer to rely upon the county committees to do the job for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman must be aware that the reason why landlords are not doing that is because it is very hard to get the case past the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I0985">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1955</span>
land tribunal, and landlords have given up any hope of looking after their own land. That is why many landlords are selling their land and refuse to remain as landlords.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may be right about that, but on top of that is going to be the additional risk of costs being awarded against him. That only makes it worse. That is really my point. I am not happy about the decision to use costs in an original application. I hope that when the Government come to look at this matter again, they will, in fact, interpret their undertaking to us widely enough for them not necessarily to be committed on that point. If they are committed on that point, I personally am not prepared to part with this Clause in this form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first applicant ought not to be put under the risk of costs, because the fellow is only using the powers we went to a great deal of trouble to give him—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oppressively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On this question of "oppressively," I do not believe that if the Act says that the landlord may apply for consent to give notice to quit or may apply for a certificate of good husbandry the Act by itself can be oppressive. But if the landlord, having submitted his application to the view of the county committee, loses, we say that he has every right to exercise the right of going to the tribunal. I do not see how that can be oppressive. If he goes again the next year and the year after, that may be oppressive on the tenant in the proper carrying out of his duties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the right hon. Gentleman recognise that, in the first hearing before the tribunal, facts may emerge as to the conduct of the landowner which show quite clearly that the particular application is not 	<i>bona fide,</i> and is, in fact, oppressive. It may be all very well to say that the first application which is made cannot be oppressive, but on the hearing of that application it may well emerge that the landlord has been guilty of very serious oppression. I should have thought that I would have carried the right hon. Gentleman with me in saying that where we find that occurring there ought to be power to penalise that conduct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1956</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but I do not accept that view. If we want to get rid of the Agricultural Act this is a very good way of going about it. This will, in fact, throw the whole thing into much greater disuse than exists at the moment. If we discover at a hearing—and after all the hearing is limited to the terms of the case—that the landlord is a bad landlord in every respect, the tenant will have his own rights about that, and by using them he risks being penalised for making use of the Agricultural Act because of costs, that is not really in accordance with the spirit of the Act. It will encourage the Act not to be used; it will frighten people off.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is absolutely wrong about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is no good the hon. and learned Solicitor-General saying that I am absolutely wrong about that. I am certain that it is not recognised outside this House that the effect of what the Government are doing is not only to hit at the vexatious, repeated use of this procedure, but also to discourage the use of the procedure anyway. The hon. and learned Gentleman has given us a certain assurance that he will look at the words again. I hope that he will look at them in general terms, and that he will also think about this point. What we all want is greater use to be made of Part II of the Act in appropriate cases. After all, it is the farmer who really matters in all this. We want the fellow who farms the land not to be put in repeated danger or trouble so that he loses heart and starts looking around to get out and a bad spirit generally emerges. That, unless I am very badly advised and mistaken, is what we all want. The Minister has only started to look at this point. No one, I suspect, has made representations to him about the penalising use of the Act. He started by taking account of representations about the vexatious use of the Act, and this other thing has slipped in. That shows how easily one can begin to widen a matter. I dislike this widening, and I say that quite frankly. I think that we would be well advised to direct our attention to hitting at the difficulties, abuse or unpleasantness that has already shown itself. We should be very unwise to seek to hit at something that has not shown itself, because we might do greater
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I0986">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1957</span>
harm then than if we were not seeking to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the Solicitor-General said that our argument was too narrow because it achieved too wide a result. I shall be quite happy if he will look at this matter again and try to choose words which achieve more specifically the result we desire, and I am quite prepared to withdraw the Amendment on the understanding that this matter will be looked at again. I do, however, beg the Government not to go wider than the abuse of which the Minister is convinced, without securing a good deal of attention from people outside as to what the effect will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister still has a regular conference with the county chairmen. That used to happen in the old days, and very valuable meetings they used to be. I would ask the Minister to put to that meeting of county chairmen, and if he cannot do that, to ask his liaison officers to put to the county chairmen, what they think the effect will be of taking powers to penalise the first application?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pretty sure that the reply they will get will be, "For heaven's sake don't do that, because we are already having trouble in getting people to make use of the powers." But they will all say, "Do, of course, help us by discouraging the fellow who keeps going." If the Minister does that, I am sure that he will be able to find words, or that the Solicitor-General will be able to, which will achieve that specific result and make this a very much better Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are glad to have obtained this particular assurance from the Government. This is a very important Clause and it is important that it should be effective when we part with it. In view of the assurance that the Minister will look at all the points raised in the discussion and will try to get the right form of words, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>Clause 5 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 6.</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>—(POWER OF AGRICULTURAL LAND TRIBUNAL TO REFER QUESTIONS OF LAW TO HIGH COURT.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move in page 4, line 3, to leave out from first "of," to "any,"</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1958</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it might be convenient to consider this Amendment together with the Amendment in the name of the right hon. Gentleman at the top of page 442—page 4, line 10, leave out from "section," to "any," in line 11.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point involved is a short one and will not perhaps cause a long discussion, but that again depends on whether we get an attractive answer from the Solicitor-General the first time or the second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the Amendment is simply to take out the Minister as one of the persons who, of his own volition, where he is not concerned, can require the reference of the case to the High Court. As it reads at the moment, the Clause states, if I understand it correctly, that the land tribunal may refer a case to the High Court at the request of any party to the proceedings or of the Minister of Agriculture, before or after they have reached their decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other Amendment allows the Minister of Agriculture to make an application, even though the tribunal has turned him down. What we do not understand in these cases is why the Minister should want to come in and upset the situation when everyone else is happy about it. I know that some people like to appeal to courts of law. Personally, I do not. I have explained this to the hon. Member for Orpington and to some of his hon. Friends. I am content with the present situation, and I think it better to leave the matter there. Some people want to a seek a court of law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But what is the purpose here? It is that if a party to the proceedings is advised or himself feels that a decision has been taken on a bad case—that the law was infringed or not properly carried out and that the tribunal had not given weight to that—that person shall be able to secure that a court of law shall consider the point involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That may or may not be right, but to say also that even though the tenant does not feel that and even if the landlord does not feel that, nevertheless, the Minister may himself come in before or after the tribunal has reached its decision and at some unspecified date—no doubt the date will be specified in the regulations but it is not specified at the moment—perhaps up to six months afterwards, as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I0987">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1959</span>
the Joint Parliamentary Secretary said on Second Reading, seems to me to introduce a considerable degree of uncertainty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen? The landlord and the tenant are involved. The tenant wins the case. The landlord does not take up any point of law, but some six months later—and during all that six months the tenant will be in uncertainty—the Minister or the local county committee, I suppose, may themselves intervene and go to a court of law. The whole thing may be decided on perhaps a very small legal point. That is not what the hon. Member for Orpington had in mind at all. It adds an additional hazard for the people whom, I suppose, he regards as his clients. It puts them in an additional difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that if the Minister is a party, he must have the right of appeal in a court of law. That is an inevitable corollary of what the hon. Member for Orpington is seeking, and he must frankly tell Mr. Marsh and his friends that the result of what he is doing is not only to give them the right of appeal, but to give the Minister that right where he is a party. But to provide also that the Minister may come in where he is not a party and where he is not aggrieved—and there are two references here, one is to the parties in the first Amendment and later on there is reference to the aggrieved person—and say that he shall still have the right to intervene on a point of legal provision, and possibly get the whole thing decided on that, is to put everyone concerned into a state of uncertainty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the other point. We may be wrong on legal arguments. I never promise a lawyer that I will take his advice because I have found in many cases that I have been much better off by standing on my own feet, but we will listen to what the Solicitor-General has to say. I think the result will be the one I forecast, and if that is the legal position, I ask the Minister very seriously to consider the result of it, because I think it will be an extremely unhappy one. I would prefer, if we are to have appeals on points of law at all, to restrict the rights of appeal to the parties concerned and leave it at that, and not have a bureaucracy—the Minister—having the right to come in and upset everyone else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1960</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Belper (Mr. G. Brown), in the course of his lucid and somewhat lengthy speech, has put forward a question which could be expressed very shortly. If I gathered the contents of his speech correctly, he is merely asking why the Minister of Agriculture should have the right to take one of the decisions of this tribunal to the High Court if the parties to that hearing before the tribunal were content with the decision. That is the simple question to which I propose to direct my observations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At first sight, it seems odd—and it struck me as odd the first time I saw it—to give the Minister of Agriculture this, right when he is not a party. But, in practice, there are valid reasons for so doing. I put my argument and I state the reasons in two ways. Take, first, the case put by the right hon. Gentleman, in which the landlord and tenant are both satisfied with the decision of the tribunal—I should have thought, a somewhat unlikely hypothesis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It often happens.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They accept it, but I said "satisfied." Take that as the position. The decision of the tribunal can only be taken to the High Court when it is a matter of law. Suppose it is clear that the tribunal has proceeded on a wrong principle of law. Obviously, if the tribunal has decided in accordance with a wrong principle in that case, the tribunal cannot be expected to reverse itself. It will go on deciding in other cases in accordance with what is believed by some people to be a wrong principle of law. If the Amendment is accepted, the matter cannot be tested until a case comes forward in which the Minister is a party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh no.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is assuming that the Minister will have the right interpretation of law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Workington obviously has not followed me. I have taken the very case
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I0988">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1961</span>
put by the right hon. Gentleman, when both parties to the hearing accept the decision of the tribunal. I am saying that there is ground for supposing, rightly or wrongly, that the tribunal has acted on a wrong principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is only in that belief that the matter can be taken to the High Court; it is only on a question of law. If it does not go to the High Court on that occasion to test out that question of law, it must follow that in all subsequent cases when the Minister is not a party and is not aggrieved, he cannot take the matter to the High Court to get the question tested. And so there might be a series of cases in which the High Court, when the matter comes before it, decides that a wrong principle of law has been adopted. I should have thought it desirable that this power should rest with the Minister where there was reason for believing that a wrong principle of law had been applied, so that the matter could be tested at the beginning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the Solicitor-General a question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister takes up a case when both parties to it have accepted the decision, obviously he will be required to pay the costs of taking it up. That happens in some cases already, and in that instance I should have thought it was a desirable method.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Take the case in which the parties to the reference accept the decision but one of them is dissatisfied, a case in which the Minister is not a party. A small tenant, for instance, would like to get the question of law settled when he thinks that the tribunal have wrongly decided in law, but he does not think he can afford it. Is it not right to enable the Minister to take it up and take over the expense and get the question of law answered?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman mentions legal aid. He should know that a party seeking legal aid may be required to make a substantial contribution. The tenant who is affected by the decision may say to himself, "I am prepared to accept this decision, though I am not satisfied because I think a wrong principle of law has been applied, but it is not worth my while spending a good deal of my own money, even if I get legal aid, to get the question of law resolved." In that case, which might well arise, I suggest it is desirable that the Minister should have the right of getting the question of law tested at the first opportunity. Does the right hon.

It is not only lawyers who can have a view about the correct interpretation of the law. Much less is it lawyers who can be trusted to say what will happen in following up the law. The Clause will make a lawyers' holiday and provide employment for a lot of country lawyers. To give the Minister the right to intervene when neither party wants to intervene is giving to local solicitors an assurance that if only they can persuade somebody in the local office of the Ministry, with whom they are on very good terms, that there is a worthwhile point of law, there is somebody with an unlimited coffer to pay the bill and take the matter up. I am not at all surprised that legal people think that is a good point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now address myself to the Minister, who is responsible for the policy of the Bill. I am not sure that the Bill is good policy, nor do I think the Solicitor-General is right in saying that if there is a case in which both landlord and tenant, and they alone, are involved and they are both happy about it, the matter could not go to the High Court until there arises a case in which the Minister is engaged. It was at that stage that I wanted first to interrupt, because, obviously, that was not true. The very next case may also involve only landlord and tenant, but it may well be that in that case either the landlord or the tenant wants to raise the point of law. The matter, therefore, does not have to wait for the Minister to come in. It is unlikely, if there is anything in the point of law and if lawyers are as good as we are commonly told they are, that all landlords and tenants in a whole series of cases would have lawyers who miss the same point of law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask other lawyers in the Committee what happens in the ordinary processes of law. We hear of cases that are decided in one of the divisional courts, and for years and years the law is administered on the basis of those decisions. There are lawyers who believe that a decision is wrong in law, but as far as I know nobody has the right to appeal to the High Court. If the court settles a legal case in the ordinary way and its legal decision is thought by some lawyers to be wrong, is there any Government Department, the Attorney-General or anybody else, which is invested with the right to take it to the next higher court? Does not that
	<span class='label label-info column'>1964</span>
case, in the ordinary processes of law, have to await a case which somebody takes higher up?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I, who am entirely a layman, should have thought, on the ordinary, practical every day work of the hon. and learned Gentleman's own profession, that what he has laid down as the law simply is not the case. My hon. Friends and I have been involved in many trade union cases in which we have been certain that the decision was wrong in law, but we have simply had to wait for a suitable case to take to a higher court or until we could raise sufficient money to finance the case. We have had all this stuff from the Solicitor-General about this provision being put in so that the Ministry of Agriculture can take the burden of costs off the applicant who does not have the means, but it simply does not happen for anybody else in the land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I am offended by any other case, if I get a wrong decision and want to appeal to a higher court for that case to be overturned, I must either stand the racket and the risks of costs, or I must get legal aid if it is open to me. Why is the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill being used to change the position so far as legal aid is concerned? Had we on this side put down an Amendment to change it, we would have been told that the appropriate place to do so was in a Legal Aid Bill and not in this Bill. The legal arguments of the Solicitor-General, who put the kindest gloss on it, are very thin and in some respects do not even stand up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister clearly is going beyond the point he started to meet. He set out to meet the sort of point about which the hon. Member for Orpington is concerned, that the farmer or tenant who feels aggrieved that a decision has been lost, because a point of law was wrongly taken or not taken at all, should have an appeal. The Minister is now going further and is putting the tenant in jeopardy by giving the Minister, the bureaucracy, an additional chance to intervene.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Did the Minister deliberately set out to do that and to widen the thing beyond the original point? If so, he owes us an explanation. If not, why does he neither accept the Amendment nor take back the Clause to look at it again, as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I0990">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1965</span>
he did on an earlier occasion? No Government Department ever contents itself with making the Amendment that people want made. Their pervading sin is that they always want to take wider powers and cover all possible combinations and computations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what has happened here. I invite the Minister, particularly after the legal arguments that we have heard, to say, "What I really wanted to do was this. If you think it raises other points, I should not want that to happen, and I should like to think again about its implications." If the right hon. Gentleman tells us that, we will be satisfied. If not, we will continue to press the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not like this Clause at all. It will make the proceedings much too complicated and expensive. Something like the machinery of the Arbitration Act, which is used in defining the 1923 Act dealing with agricultural valuations, would be much better and much less costly. The proceedings under that Act in regard to claims are just as complicated in law or in fact as any that arise under the 1947 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When anyone who has been acting for a landlord or a tenant fails to agree, he either agrees on an arbitrator or applies to the Minister, who selects an arbitrator from the panel agreed by the Lord Chancellor. The arbitrator deals with the points made by either side and if during those proceedings a point of law arises, one side or the other may ask the arbitrator to state a case for decision by the court. I think I am right in saying that it is always the county court, from which there is no appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any cases with which I have had to deal we have had a quick and cheap decision from the court, and the fact that the case goes to that court has not deterred either of the parties from asking for a case of law to be stated. In this instance, the tribunal are sitting very much as an arbitrator sits and if during the proceedings either side is not satisfied with the decision, they can do the same as the arbitrator does, send the case of law for a solution by the court, and the solution is final.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Clause states
	<br><blockquote><p>"a decision before or after."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1966</span>
I ask the Committee to remember that the point of law to be decided may well be as to whether a tenant farmer has to give up his farm on a certain date, say 25th March. A case can be stated and a decision reached before or after the tribunal, so it may well be that, before a decision is reached, 25th March has arrived and the man has left his farm, whereas the decision may be that he ought not to have left his farm. Therefore there will be all kinds of unnecessary complications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask my hon. and learned Friend to make this much more in line with the proceedings before an arbitrator under the 1923 Act, which, I repeat, was just as complicated originally for valuers and, in fact, had to be altered subsequently. However, we have been able to carry through the business readily and get a decision easily. It is wrong that after the tribunal have made a decision which is agreed to by both parties, somebody else can come along and suggest that the Minister of Agriculture should send this case to the High Court for a decision. The tribunal should make a decision and, if it is accepted, that decision should be final.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mallalieu</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that nobody, at least on this side of the Committee. will oppose anything a Government do merely on the ground that it is novel. If a thing is novel, both sides of the Committee will want to look at it to see if it is good before deciding whether to accept it or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Solicitor-General has attempted to make out a case for a totally novel state of affairs, namely, that a Minister may step in, after a decision has been made—a decision to which he was not a party—and may oppose it. The hon. and learned Gentleman says rightly that if a decision on a point of law is decided wrongly before the tribunal, other cases will follow it and that they also will be decided wrongly. However the hon. and learned Gentleman has failed to show us how that state of affairs differs from that which exists in every other civil case. He said that the bad law will have to stand until the Minister intervenes but, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Belper (Mr. G. Brown) pointed out, anybody can go to appeal in a subsequent case if he wishes to do so. So there is no difference whatever between
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I0991">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1967</span>
the proceedings before a tribunal and all other civil cases in this respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it suggested that in future Ministers may intervene in all civil cases to which they were not parties, in order completely to upset decisions reached in those cases? Consider the position of the farmer who has been successful before the tribunal. He will now be in a state of complete uncertainty again until such time as the Minister, in his wisdom, intervenes. Of course there is a limitation on the time he may take in which to make up his mind, but considerable time will elapse during which the farmer will be in jeopardy and will remain there until the High Court or county court has come to a decision for or against him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Solicitor-General swept aside the objection of my right hon. Friend as to the costs of the unfortunate man who is put in this position by saying that if the Minister intervenes, he will bear the costs of intervening. Whose costs of intervening will the Minister bear, his own, or his own and the farmers? This is an intolerable situation which nobody who has regard for individual rights can contemplate, and something must be done. The airy way in which the Solicitor-General tried to sweep aside the objections and to say that this was a normal state of affairs, without advancing real reasons why it was different in cases before this tribunal and cases before the High Court or a county court, is not good enough. Something much more must be put forward on behalf of the Government case before we can accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. J. Astor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. and learned Friend will answer the point put by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Belper (Mr. G. Brown) because, on the evidence, the right hon. Gentleman has rather a good case. The Solicitor-General suggested that if the Ministry disagree about a point of law they have to wait until they are participating in a case. The right hon. Gentleman suggested that if the Amendment is carried the lawyers can get together with one of the participators in a subsequent case and it can be discussed. I hope my hon. and learned Friend will answer that point because otherwise the case he put is to my mind rather feeble on its surface value.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1968</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Solicitor-General will not answer, but that the reply will be left to the Minister, because here is a real conflict between the Law Department and the advice given by the Department of the Minister. I can see comings and goings between the Front Bench and the other people concerned, and I think there is great uncertainty on this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the view put forward by my right hon. Friend, that, apart from the legal aspect, the policy view should be given, because I am certain that the intention of the Minister was to appease the arguments put forward not only by the hon. Member for Orpington, but by others, that the powers of the Executive in relation to procedure should be diminished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember that when we discussed the original Act in Committee, there were long discussions on this point. As my hon. Friend has said, however, this Clause virtually strengthens the Executive. I am sure that is the view of the hon. Member for Leominster (Mr. Baldwin) and of my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Mr. J. J. Astor), who have both expressed a desire for a firmer statement from the hon. and learned Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will intervene and that he will carefully reconsider this matter and will give us the departmental point of view. The Solicitor-General has only confused the issue, and the old argument about altering the procedure to provide legal costs is a wrong argument and is not supported by the Department who have gained experience in this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no question here of altering the procedure to provide legal costs. I am sorry if I failed to make the point clear to the Committee so far as it is a point of law. Under this Clause the Minister clearly has a right of appeal if he is a party to the proceedings before the tribunal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is all right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The words which the Amendment proposes to delete give the Minister power to request the tribunal to state a case where he is not a party to the proceedings. I did not suggest that this power was in any sense a normal power. It is true that in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I0992">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1969</span>
ordinary course, where there is litigation between parties, there is no right for a Minister to come in and say that there should be an appeal. I did not suggest anything of that kind and I am afraid that the right hon. Gentleman completely misunderstood me. However, it may be my fault if he thought that I suggested anything of that kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put this forward as a novel proposal and urged that, as a matter of practice, it seemed to me to be desirable. But that again is a question of policy and I think I am right in saying that a voluminous report has been published recently which suggested, if it did not say expressly in terms, that it would be desirable, where there is a decision which appears to be wrong in law, that there should be machinery whereby that could be taken to a higher court and decided, even if the parties did not appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The object of this provision is to enable a question of law to be adjudicated upon. Whether by the county court or by the High Court is the subject of another Amendment which will enable this to be discussed at a later stage. The right hon. Gentleman then said that it is wrong to say that cases might be decided without the Minister having any power to take it up because he would not be a party to the reference. The inference was that he could make some private arrangement, either with the landlord or tenant. That is true. It might be one way of getting round the obstacle but it would not be as straightforward or as clear as the Minister doing it on his own. Indeed, in those circumstances, he might find that the tenant would say he did not want to be bothered with it, even if the Minister was prepared to take over the conduct of the appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that it is entirely a question of policy whether we give the Minister these powers in these special cases, but, as far as law is concerned, I should have said that there were fairly cogent arguments to be advanced for some power of applying for a case to be stated by the Minister. I emphasise this because it is relevant to the question of law as distinct from policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be difficult for us to visualise an important question of law arising which would make it desirable to go to
	<span class='label label-info column'>1970</span>
the High Court. However, if such a question did arise, I think that the decision of the High Court should be obtained as early as possible to lay down the principle with clarity for the whole of the tribunals throughout the country. But that is a matter of policy. The legal position is quite clear. The effect of the Clause as it is now drafted is clear and the effect which would follow were this Amendment adopted is equally clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of Agriculture (Sir Thomas Dugdale)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I intervene upon a point of policy? The Government have decided that it is right to give to land tribunals the power to refer questions of law to the High Court, and no doubt we shall discuss the merits of that later. If it be thought by lawyers and by members of tribunals that any doubts about the law should be tested in the High Court, it is the duty of Parliament to give that right to the tribunals. That is the policy under which I instructed this Clause to be drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Referring to the Amendment, I think a Minister of Agriculture must be vitally concerned with the proceedings before any land tribunal because the members of the agricultural committees are acting as his delegates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then he is a party, if they are concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir T. Dugdale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If he is a party. That is a question of law which I do not propose to debate. If the Minister is always a party then the right hon. Gentleman would be right, and these words would not be necessary. But just because there is a doubt about it, I was saying that, from a policy point of view, if we give to tribunals the right to appeal to the High Court on a point of law it must be right for the Minister, who is interested—I will put it no higher—in all these problems, to have the equal right to test a point of law in the High Court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will have this matter examined to see if the words are necessary. If we are always a party, quite obviously there is no necessity to have these words included. But if, as there seems to be some doubt, in certain cases we are not, then the words are necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to get clear what is suggested by the Minister so that I may consider it. The Minister says he is prepared, if he is concerned, to secure the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I0993">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1971</span>
right of appeal where agricultural executive committees were involved in a case before a tribunal. But he was not sure, although the members of the committee were his agents, that he—the Minister—was a party, legally speaking, so far as concerns the provisions of this Bill. I interjected to try to get clear first that the case in which the Minister wishes to intervene is where an agricultural executive committee is involved. If that be so, there is no disagreement between us, because I look upon agricultural executive committees as representing the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman went on to say that there will be some cases in which "we" should not be a party. I take it that by "we" he meant the A.E.C.?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir T. Dugdale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I meant the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman make this clear? Does he desire the power to intervene in any case where the A.E.C. was not the initiating party, the original party—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A party to the reference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes—not a party to the reference? Does the Minister wish for power to intervene in any other case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir T. Dugdale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that he does, and so I am afraid we have made no progress. Shall we keep this discussion going until 1 o'clock, or would the Minister now like to move to report Progress, so that he may think about it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir T. Dugdale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, let us continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the Minister's own argument there cannot be a basis for desiring the right to intervene in a case in which he is not concerned or was originally a party. The right hon. Gentleman may have given a better description of this matter than I did, but he meant exactly the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What he set out to do—the words he used were, "the instructions I gave"—was to meet the position of the farmer or landlord who feels he has lost a case because a point of law was not rightly taken. The Minister said that was the instruction he gave to his Department, but that is not what has emerged. The right hon. Gentleman now says he has
	<span class='label label-info column'>1972</span>
been advised that he should not do that alone; that he should take these wider powers and obtain the right to do what the Solicitor-General says no other Minister has the right to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who is running this Government? The Minister says, "That is my policy. Those are the instructions I gave, but I have gone back on that position because my advisers have changed the policy." Really, that cannot be allowed to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no case for putting the tenant farmer in jeopardy when he has won an action. Just think of what the effect would be. A case has been settled. The A.E.C. was not a party. Both the appellant and the respondent are quite happy. Some months later, someone in the Ministry, or in a local department, or the local solicitor to the committee, pipes up, and says, "We think this would be a good thing to get settled "—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gooch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A police State!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not far from being that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Knowing that they have public money to spend, they are not even concerned about whether such expenditure is worth while. So they intervene and take the matter to the High Court. Let us suppose that a point of law seems at that stage to be well taken and that the tenant loses—after six months, or it may well be nine months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tenant then has the right to ask the High Court to state a case to the Appeal Court. After all, tenants do not usually act wholly on their own. It may well be that other people are interested, and that there is some outside body prepared to subscribe to his expenses. So the thing goes wandering on and could easily be settled finally in the House of Lords in favour of the tenant. Think what we have lost. Think of the money involved over something with which, in the first place, no one was concerned. I contend that this is a dangerous thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Solicitor-General said that recently a committee—I did not get the name of the committee, he did not mention it—had issued a voluminous report which did not recommend that there should be this change in the general law, but rather implied that it would be a good thing if there were such a change. I do not know whether it was recommended or suggested—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I0994">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1973</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I indicated that, according to my recollection, the committee recommended something on those lines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Which committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Evershed Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman will see if he looks at the OFFICIAL REPORT tomorrow that what he said was that the committee did not make a recommendation, but suggested it would be a good thing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was quoting from memory, because the point was raised, and the right hon. Gentleman should not put it round the other way. To the best of my recollection—it is some time since I looked at this passage—that Committee did recommend, and I think I said so—that some procedure of this kind might be adopted. I told the right hon. Gentleman that I thought this a novel procedure, but I put forward the argument which I thought might commend itself to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not want to say that the hon. and learned Gentleman had said the Committee had recommended it, if all he said was that the Committee had suggested it. If he is now saying that his memory is that the Committee recommended it, that is all right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why should this substantial change in the law be made in the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill? Such a change would be more appropriate in a general legal Bill. The Minister is a Member of the Cabinet. The Solicitor-General is not. May I ask the Minister if it be the case that before the conclusions of the Evershed Committee could be put into effect in a Bill, the decision of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet would be required?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May we take it, from what has been said by the Solicitor-General, that it is now Cabinet policy that the Evershed Committee's recommendation on this point shall be implemented? If so, may I ask the Minister why it has been put into this little Bill? This is a vast legal point. With the exception of the Solicitor-General, we are here because we are supposed to know something about agriculture, and not because we are experienced in the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1974</span>
With the exception of the Solicitor-General, the hon. and learned Member for Bolton, East (Mr. Philip Bell) is the most distinguished lawyer on the other side of the Committee. The only lawyer we have—though a very good one, and one who would make three of the Solicitor-General—is my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Brigg (Mr. Mallalieu). The rest of us are not lawyers, so why should we be sitting on a Committee, which it is proposed shall insert into this Bill a very considerable legal principle, when we know little about the law? If a Committee were to be set up to deal with this legal point I venture to suggest that there is not one of us who would be selected to sit upon it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must realise that he is in a tangle. This is not the policy which he set out to achieve. This is not an agricultural, but a legal question. Cannot the Minister shorten our discussion by saying that he will undertake to examine this matter closely? If he will not give such an undertaking, we must press the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir T. Dugdale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has gone wider in his speech than does the Amendment on the Order Paper. I will not deal with the legal side, but I will see that consideration is given to the wording of the Amendment so that I may be satisfied whether the words are necessary or not. The object of the Clause is simple. It is that land tribunals shall have the chance of submitting points of law to the High Court. As I have said, a Minister of Agriculture will always be vitally concerned with proceedings before such a tribunal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mallalieu</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had opened before us this wonderful vista of litigation by my right hon. Friend the Member for Belper. I have no doubt that the lips of many legal hon. Gentlemen will be smacking at the idea, but, at the same time, their eyes will boggle at the immensity of the principle involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now we have had what we might well have had at an earlier stage, a statement of Government policy, both from the Solicitor-General and from the Minister. But there was one point which they left out, and of which I would ask the Minister to take particular note. If he insists on this principle of intervention in a suit to which he was not a party, will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V002P0I0995">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1975</span>
he see to it that a farmer who is successful in the first instance before the tribunal is not mulcted in costs as a result of his intervention?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He will, of course, pay his own costs, but what about the costs of a successful appeal? Not a word has been said by the Solicitor-General or the Minister about that. We must do something to protect a farmer whose rights are being
	<span class='label label-info column'>1976</span>
impugned and who may be put to considerable expense. Not one word has been said on the matter. Can the—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
