<p><i>Further amendment proposed</i> [17th April] No. 21, in page 2, line 40, to leave out 'either'.—[<i>Mr. Raison.</i>]</p>
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Rost</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was on the point of concluding my remarks on the amendments to this clause when the bell tolled. It simply remains for me to remind the Government that we expect more than the type of answer we have had so far in Committee. If the Government intend to press this clause and retain it in its present form, we expect a comprehensive reply.<br><br>
It is a flagrant breach of natural justice to allow the arrears of council house rents to be collected from other tenants in areas which, because of the reorganisation of local government, now happen to be within the local authority area which is responsible for collecting the arrears. It would be intolerable to allow these arrears to be collected by a general increase in council rents over an area which is wider than that which was originally involved in the illegality.<br><br>
I urge the Under-Secretary of State, who, no doubt, will be trying to justify the drafting of the legislation in this way, to consider seriously whether he regards it as fair and just that the local authorities should be allowed to have discretion to collect those arrears by forcing the extra rents out of innocent tenants who were in no way implicated in the original illegality and who were not even responsible for electing the councillors who broke the law by refusing to implement the Housing Finance Act. That demands a satisfactory explanation.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 190</span>
In North-East Derbyshire rent payers are waiting to hear the reply which the Minister makes. If he genuinely believes that the purpose of the legislation is to remove the bitterness and rancour, I warn him that he will not succeed in doing so if he insists that the arrears can be collected forcibly from law-abiding council house tenants who have always paid their rents and accepted their democratic responsibilities and who now find themselves, because of the reorganisation of local government, part of an area for which irresponsible councillors were elected and likely to be subjected to a major injustice.<br><br>
I hope that the Government will accept the amendment and introduce a little fairness and equity into this despicable piece of legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Gerald Kaufman)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At our last Sitting I assured the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison) that I would give him a precise reply to the quotation which he gave us from Councillor Clive Wilkinson of Birmingham Council. I assure the hon. Gentleman and the Committee that the way in which Councillor Wilkinson thought that he could deal with this problem is ruled out by the Bill. Councillor Wilkinson was speaking in November when the details of the Bill were not available, and at that time he may have thought that the use of the suspense account was a possibility. The Bill makes it impossible for that method to be employed. The only methods that can be employed are those contained in Clauses 2 and 3. I hope that that explanation will satisfy the hon. Gentleman. I want to make that as clear and categorical as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timothy Raison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his comments, but he will recall that at our last sitting, speaking more generally about our request for further information, he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"If there is any further assistance I can give to the Committee, I shall do so."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Standing Committee D,</i> 17th April 1975; c. 178.]</p></blockquote>
I ask the hon. Gentleman whether he can give us further information about the other important points we have questioned and also about the new factor, which may have more bearing on Clause 4, namely, the latest developments in Clay Cross.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1975V004P0I1013">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 191</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kaufman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be glad to do that. It may be for the convenience of the Committee if I were to give both the information which the hon. Gentleman requested, about which I have been able to do something, and also any statement that he might wish to secure from me about the latest developments at Clay Cross. If it is convenient to the Committee I will happily do that on the Question, That the clause stand part of the Bill. I shall be happy to do it now if the Committee would prefer that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be helpful to have the information now. After all, it may not be necessary to have a debate on the Question, That the clause stand part of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kaufman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I shall be glad to assist the Committee on the matters to which the hon. Gentleman refers.<br><br>
In doing so, I acknowledge the constructive approach of Opposition Members to the clause. The hon. and learned Member for Southport (Mr. Percival) said at the beginning of our consideration of the clause last Thursday that the Opposition accepted the basic aims of the clause but wished to improve the provisions to achieve those aims. We are grateful for that co-operation in seeking to make the Bill better. I hope that the fact that we have not accepted amendments will not be taken as a sign of unwillingness on our part to consider amendments seriously. That is not so, as the report of our proceedings and the remarks I now have to make will show.<br><br>
We accepted the Opposition's view about the existing provision to enable a district auditor to apportion the sum in a rent loss certificate where the area of a former council has been split to make two or more new councils on local government reorganisation. That was the subject of Amendment No. 18. We have referred that point to parliamentary counsel and we shall if necessary come back to it on Report after receiving his advice. We are grateful for having a possible weakness drawn to our attention.<br><br>
We are grateful to the hon. Member for Aylesbury for pointing out a possible defect in subsection (1) about the mandatory requirement to recover at a rate of not less than one-fifth each year. We do not think that there is a defect there
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 192</span>
because the requirement is to recover at a rate of not less than one-fifth by the end of each year, so that, even if so much has been recovered in previous years that the amount to be recovered in succeeding years is less than one-fifth of the certified sum, nevertheless, the rate of one-fifth is still being maintained. However, we are looking at this further and I shall inform the hon. Gentleman of the outcome. Meanwhile, I acknowledge the careful and helpful way in which he scrutinised this provision to ensure that it does what we all want it to do.<br><br>
Hon. Members opposite quite understandably made the point at our last meeting that they had no idea what amount would fall on individual authorities to recover. All they knew was that the estimated total surchargeable loss was about £1£million spread over 20 authorities. As promised, I have discussed this request for further information with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. As the Committee may be aware, my right hon. Friend is unwell. I know that he wished to be present this morning, as, indeed, he told me, and I offer the Committee my right hon. Friend's apologies. He is, unfortunately, confined to bed, and will be for a week, and perhaps longer. I have discussed the request with my right hon. Friend and he has agreed that we should help the Committee as much as possible.<br><br>
I had the matter looked into and we have obtained estimates of the likely rent and rate increases over the five-year recovery period. These are set out in two tables of figures which can be—are now being—circulated to hon. Members. I stress that the information is based on material available to the Department from contracts with authorities, particularly over applications for Section 62 (4) directions, and also from Press cuttings. It may be that the figures which the auditors finally arrive at could be very different and there may, of course, be authorities who will convince the auditors that no loss was due to negligence or conduct. It is for that reason that, as the hon. and learned Member for Southport so correctly pointed out last Thursday, it would be quite improper to name names or provide information which would identify the councils or the councillors.<br><br>
As the Committee will see from the information available to the Department it would appear that where recovery of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1975V004P0I1014">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 193</span>
estimated losses from the areas of the defaulting authorities only is over the full five years, then the broad range of rent increases would be about 2p to 9p a week with one exception requiring about 27p. If the recoveries were extended over the whole of a successor authority's area the amounts would be much less. Should authorities decide to exercise the option under Clause 3 to change the amount of a rent loss certificate to the rates, then the equivalent figures would of course be for smaller amounts, ranging broadly from very minor increases indeed to just over a penny rate, again with the exception of one area which would require about a 2· 5p rate.<br><br>
Small as these amounts may sound, there is, on rates as on rents, a need to ensure that the Bill does not result in unreasonable burdens. It will be up to the local authority to judge this. As I have already told the Committee, there is nothing to prevent an authority from recovering in a shorter period than the maximum if it so wishes. Our purpose, in short, is to ensure that local authorities are put into the position of being able to make full recovery without causing hardship.<br><br>
I will now deal with what was said by the hon. Members for Aylesbury and Derbyshire, South-East (Mr. Rost). To put it mildly, they expressed some misgivings about the methods of collection which are laid down in the Bill. I fully understand those misgivings. It is difficult, perhaps impossible, to find a way of recouping this money which is satisfactory to all.<br><br>
In considering this matter I would not wish to restrict the range of options. I would prefer to consider whether the range of options might be further extended in a way which could conceivably meet the points made by the hon. Gentlemen. It is up to the hon. Gentlemen whether to press the amendment under consideration. If they would prefer to withdraw it, I undertake to consider the range of options open to local authorities between now and Report, if necessary consulting local authorities to see whether there are further options which they would find acceptable or options from which, perhaps, they would prefer not to have to choose.<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
I must emphasise that I am not making any firm commitment to introduce further
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 194</span>
amendments. I am saying that we shall consider the points which have been made by Opposition Members. I confess that we are not entirely satisfied with the Bill as it stands. My right hon. Friend made it clear on Second Reading that we would be ready to consider amendments designed to assist the Bill. He made it clear that we would be ready to consider these matters again. I repeat that I give no undertaking that we shall bring amendments forward, but I assure the Committee that we shall consider whether there is any further way in which the dissatisfaction felt by Opposition Members can be allayed or assuaged. That assurance I certainly give.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Aylesbury raised what he somewhat arcanely referred to as "further recent developments". He was referring to fresh surcharges totalling £52,200—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not think that it would be in order to discuss under this clause the latest surcharges. I think that they would be better discussed on the Question, That Clause 4 stand part of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kaufman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, Mr. Fitch, I respect and accept your ruling. It was my wish to respond to the request of the Opposition. I trust that the Opposition will understand that I am prepared and ready to respond to that request. I shall do so when you instruct me, Mr. Fitch, that it is best done.<br><br>
I return to the amendments. We do not approach in any spirit of obduracy what Opposition Members have said. We are willing to try to be flexible on the basis on which I have put our position to the Committee. We appreciate the spirit in which the Opposition are seeking to improve the clause, with whose main aims they agree. We shall consider seriously the points that are still unresolved. We shall not hesitate to table amendments on Report if improvements are required. We shall seek to achieve by our joint endeavours the provision of a fair and practical method of recovery of the losses through increase of rent.<br><br>
In the light of what Opposition Members have said we would welcome their withdrawal of the amendments. If they do not feel ready to withdraw them I must ask my hon. Friends to vote against them.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1975V004P0I1015">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 195</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for the information which he has given us, and which I think is highly relevant. I appreciate that he had not intended to provide it at this juncture. I gather that he intended to keep it for the debate on the Question, That the clause stand part of the Bill. However, we rather forced him to supply it at this stage.<br><br>
The information relates to the points which were debated in earlier amendments. Having had a quick look at the information I believe that it completely supports our case and completely demolishes the Government's case. It might even be said that it demolishes the case for spreading the increase over three years, because there hardly seems, when we consider the sums involved, any need for that. There is only one sum listed that could be called a reasonably substantial sum. I refer to No. 8. There is there an average weekly increase of 27p, which would come out at 2· 5p. The rest of the sums that are listed are very small. To argue that there is any necessity to spread the increases over five years and to talk about an average weekly rent increase of 1p. 2p or 3p seems to be nonsensical. I cannot understand why the Government refused to make the concession for which we were asking in the previous group of amendments. We have now passed on from that debate, but I hope that we shall have an opportunity to return to that subject later.<br><br>
The Minister has requested that we should withdraw the present set of amendments. I do not feel that we can agree to that. The Minister has advanced no serious argument on this subject, nor has he said anything except that the Government might extend the range of options which are available to local authorities. He has given us no indication of what he means by extending the range. Our concern is to narrow the range. In that context it does not seem to me to be a splendid or generous response to say "We shall provide a few extra options." If the Minister had given some indication of what the new options might be we would have listened carefully and might possibly have responded sympathetically. However, I do not feel that we can do so in the light of what has he said.<br><br>
This debate has been about one of the most offensive ingredients in an offensive
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 196</span>
measure, namely, the possibility that council tenants in areas which derived no advantage from the defiance of the Housing Finance Act should have to bear the burden. As I have said, I cannot understand how Labour Members can be happy about such a proposal. How can anyone say that it is reasonable that, for instance, council tenants in the city of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Mr. Silverman) should be required to pay increased rents for benefits which they did not enjoy? Can the hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington explain that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Julius Silverman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The question arises of whether there will be a certificate in Birmingham.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know, but it is well known that Birmingham is one of the authorities where that could occur.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silverman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not known with any certainty.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman illustrates the point that we have been labouring over and over again—namely, that we are approaching this matter in the dark. We do not have sufficient information. It would be no surprise to anyone to learn that Birmingham is one of the local authorities where the question of a certificate might arise. The audit has not been completed in Birmingham. We are waiting to see what will happen as a result of the audit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silverman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If there were a certificate—and I have followed closely the operations in Birmingham—I believe that there would be no justification for its issue. Of course, I do not know what the district auditor might do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raision</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman is implying that if the district auditor were to produce a certificate to the effect that the charges should be levied he would lead a protest against it—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silverman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raison</span><span class='membercontribution'>:—or accept the law as it stands.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silverman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not saying that. I am saying that there has been little
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1975V004P0I1016">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 197</span>
indication so far that there will be a surcharge. I mention that because Birmingham has been mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will leave the point at that. Of course, Birmingham is believed to be one of the authorities where such a situation might arise.<br><br>
Whether or not Birmingham is surcharged, and whether or not a certificate is issued under the Bill, I still believe that Labour Members must ask themselves whether they believe it right that people who live in council houses in parts of North-East Derbyshire—I return to a normal example—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silverman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And on to safe ground.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, safe ground. We know some of the facts that apply to that area of Derbyshire, but do Labour Members think that it is right that council tenants in North-East Derbyshire and outside Clay Cross should have their rents increased to pay for the money that was not collected by the previous Clay Cross Council? I ask them to think about this matter seriously and to support us in these amendments. Unless the Minister is prepared to give us a clearer idea of the sort of options that he is thinking about, and unless he can give us one good reason for saying that council tenants should face rent increases, we are bound to press our amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must emphasise the point that has been raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison)—that we are in the dark. I do not under-estimate the difficulties which face the Minister. Indeed, he has confirmed my suspicion that one of them is a real difficulty. I have pointed out to him that the mess in which the Government find themselves comes as a result of the mess that they manufactured in the first place. We are now in the difficulty that we do not know whether this £500,000 is part of the £1½ million.<br><br>
Perhaps the Minister will give us some indication of the Government's thinking. Perhaps he can tell us something about the 27p and the 2· 5p. If those figures relate to Clay Cross and they relate to the period from 16th November 1972, up to which date the Clay Cross Council had already been surcharged, to 1st April 1974 there would be no harm in his identifying the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 198</span>
item. I say that because everyone knows that the failure of the Clay Cross Council to implement during that period was defiance. Does that item relate to Clay Cross? If the Minister says that it does he will not be letting the council in the cart as it is in the cart already. If he says that it does not relate to Clay Cross we shall know that another council defied the Act in a big way and let its tenants or ratepayers in for this amount.<br><br>
Will the Minister say why an area other than the defaulting area should be liable either for increased rates or rents? Of course, we are dealing only with rents at the moment. Despite the powerful case advanced by my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury the Minister did not direct himself for one minute to the question of why there should be a discretion to increase the rents of tenants other than those in the defaulting area.<br><br>
On Second Reading the Secretary of State for the Environment said:
<br><blockquote><p>"the burden of making it good must not fall on the national taxpayer."</p></blockquote>
We agree with that. The right hon. Gentleman then said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The loss was incurred locally; it must be made good locally."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 24th March 1975; Vol. 889, c. 48.]</p></blockquote>
If the right hon. Gentleman really meant that the lost rent income should be made good by raising the money from the defaulting area there could be no other definition than that of making it good locally. I invite the Minister to comment upon that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silverman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman talks about defaulting and we are dealing with individual tenants in a certain area. How would he decide which tenants in the so-called defaulting area should pay increased rents?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is what the Bill says.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kaufman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silverman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman is dealing with individual tenants and not areas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have said previously that I recognise that there is the difficulty that whatever is done will be unfair. I made the point that the Government should limit the unfairness as much as
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1975V004P0I1017">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 199</span>
possible. They get nearer to limiting the unfairness by limiting the area from which the recovery is to be made to the area which was presided over by the defaulting councillors. That is what our amendment would achieve. At least the extra rent could be charged only on the council tenants in the area presided over by the councillors in default. That is not perfect, but it is far better than any other approach.<br><br>
I ask the Minister to forget about local government reorganisation and to suppose that it had not taken place. Of course, we have to allow for it in the administration of recovery, but apart from that it has no other significance. Suppose that there had not been such reorganisation, would the Minister have dreamed of saying that the losses in Clay Cross could be recovered by rent increases not merely on the council tenants of Clay Cross but on council tenants in the other areas that now go to make up North-East Derbyshire? If anyone had put that up as a serious suggestion he would have received the answer "You must be joking". Nevertheless, that is in effect what the Minister is saying. The Government are saying that by reason of this clause as it stands, all council tenants in the new North-East Derbyshire area can be called upon to make good the losses which were suffered in respect of the defaulting area. Of course, that represents only a part of North-East Derbyshire.<br><br>
Before we part with the amendments and the clause will the Minister address his mind and his observations to these practical considerations?</span></p>
<p>11 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ivan Lawrence</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am astonished at the cavalier way in which the Government hand us pieces of paper containing figures and expect us to swallow them and be satisfied. What is the Minister's explanation for not specifying the authorities referred to under cases Nos. 1–1 and so on down the page? I intervened during the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, South-East (Mr. Rost) in the hope that the Minister would take the hint and help us. What is the difference between the true economic rent which should have been paid and the £1· 50 which was raised by the Clay Cross Councillors by way of rent? What was the loss? If we do not know that we are in a maze.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 200</span>
Referring to the column headed in this circulated paper "Average Annual Rate Poundage Increases" I should like to know what effect that will have upon ratepayers. It is no use referring to decimal points of figures. The ratepayers who will be affected by this will reasonably want to know how it affects their pocket. I have made a rough calculation. If it is incorrect I shall be grateful if the Minister will correct it. I have not had long in which to study the document. In the Erewash Borough Council area the total general rate poundage is 64. On an average £5,000 house, with two or three bedrooms, that raises a rate of about £120 a year. Each 1p on the rate will cost a householder £2. Perhaps the figure is £20. May I have a moment in which to consider the matter?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is highly irregular, but never mind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lawrence</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The figure of 64p produces a rate of £120. Therefore 1p equals £20.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kaufman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is strange arithmetic.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lawrence</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A rate of 0· 25p will cost the householder £5 for the year, while 0· 15p will cost the householder £3 for one year. A rate of 1· 15p will cost that householder £23 for the year. The figure of 2· 5p at case No. 8 will cost that householder £50. That householder will pay £50 more per year. Is not it fair that such a householder should know what the consequences of this Bill will be to him financially, since even the low-paying ratepayers must pay £10 per year on their rates? Case No. 16 produces a figure of £12 per year. That means that £60 more will have to be paid as the result of the failure of the Clay Cross and other councillors to honour their trust. Is it not important that the Minister should spell out the effects of this Bill on the ratepayers living in the limited area to which he refers?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kaufman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that my attempt to assist the Committee has not been found acceptable. My officials went to a good deal of trouble to provide this information. I confess and acknowledge that it is not as clear as it might be. It
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1975V004P0I1018">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 201</span>
does not provide as much information as the Committee might wish for. The hon. and learned Member for Southport (Mr. Percival) generously pointed out at the last sitting why it was difficult to amplify this information or to name the authorities, since that would prejudice the authorities in the eyes of the district auditor.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Member for Southport referred to case 8. It is reasonably obvious that that refers to Clay Cross. However, it would have been wrong to have named Clay Cross because we would have been asked why we had not named any others. It is important that we should not name the others. I intervened during the exchange between my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Mr. Silverman) and the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison) to say that these matters were in doubt. The hon. Member for Aylesbury said that this was one of the reasons why the Opposition found the Bill unsatisfactory. Once we start to tread too far on this territory we shall be stepping on uncertain ground. I trust that the Committee will accept, within the context of my trying to be as helpful as possible, that it would be wrong for me to go any further.<br><br>
I accept that the hon. Member for Burton (Mr. Lawrence) has only just seen these figures. I saw them yesterday and have had a little longer in which to study them. Although the hon. Gentleman possesses forensic skills, his arithmetical skills do not come to the fore equally well. His arithmetic is faulty.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lawrence</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman show me where? I am prepared to accept that it is faulty, but will he show me where?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kaufman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has amplified the figures by several magnitudes. I think that it would be better if I wrote to the hon. Gentleman pointing this out rather than detain the Committee with our arithmetical exchanges.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We accept that the Secretary of State is not trying to tell the district auditors what to do. We accept that what the Secretary of State says is the position. We do not quarrel with it. However, there is a considerable mystery which it is not unreasonable to ask the Under-Secretary of State to elucidate. What has
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 202</span>
happened in the case of these orders? I am told that in the case of Camberwell the audit was adjourned last summer and has not been resumed. To a layman it seems odd that an audit should be adjourned and not resumed for a period of several months. I am not challenging the integrity of the district auditor when I ask the Minister whether he will find out whether it is true that in a number of cases audits have been adjourned and the reasons for that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kaufman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I respond to that readily. I shall ask the Department whether it will make inquiries about audits which are proceeding, those which have been suspended and, if possible, the reasons for that. I cannot say when that information will be available. However, in the light of the hon. Gentleman's anxiety to have that information, I shall have those inquiries instituted.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Member for Southport asked why it was that we could not narrow the range as far as possible to the people who had benefited. I have considered this point carefully, as has my right hon. Friend. The problem is that it is impossible to ask the specific people living in that area who benefited to pay back the rent of which they were relieved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rost</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kaufman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If that were possible it would be by far the most sensible way of dealing with the situation. However, there is a problem. Some of those people will by now have died. We cannot obtain the money from them. Ought we to pursue their heirs?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lawrence</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They were misled.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kaufman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Some of them will have moved away from the local government area in which the default took place, perhaps into the wider local government area, perhaps in the same county, perhaps to another part of the country. How do we track them down? Those are difficult questions and I assure the hon. Gentleman that we have considered them with care.<br><br>
The Government do not find these amendments acceptable for the reasons which I have given, not because we wish to ride roughshod over the susceptibilities which the Opposition demonstrated in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1975V004P0I1019">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 203</span>
moving their amendments. We have considered the problems carefully and have reconsidered them within the past few days.<br><br>
I have mentioned the wish of the Government to extend, if possible, the range of options. The hon. and learned Member for Southport justifiably asked if I would amplify that. The problem is that if we are to extend the range we need to consult the local authority organisations. If we air options publicly, and they then reject them publicly, that will cause no embarrassment to the Government. That is irrelevant in the circumstances because we are undergoing sufficient embarrassment now. However, this will cause embarrassment to the local authority organisations which will be under pressure to say why they rejected certain options. There is no wish to conceal the truth. However, the amendments are rejected for the reasons I have given.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister misunderstands me. I am not asking him to say why the range should be extended further, or what extension the Government have in mind. I asked the Government to say why it is considered necessary to extend the range and why it is already extended in the clause. I appreciate that we cannot identify the persons in the defaulting area who are responsible or who benefited. No one benefited in the areas outside the defaulting areas. Therefore, any burden falling on the people in the wider areas will fall on those who were not responsible, and who did not benefit. I do not suggest that the range of options should be extended. The only way in which to come as near as possible to achieving what the Government said they want to achieve is by limiting the recovery area to the defaulting area.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silverman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A tenant living in a defaulting area might have transferred to a non-defaulting area. There are many exchanges in a council area. We may arrive at the ridiculous situation in which a person coming from a non-defaulting area into a defaulting area has to pay while the person who removed from the defaulting area has not got to pay.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If that is the reason for extending the area, I think it is insufferably
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 204</span>
bad. It might be that one or two people have moved, but that has no bearing on the question as a whole. I cannot think that the Minister would put that forward as the reason for extending the collection area so much wider than the defaulting area. Having looked at the tables, it seems unnecessary to extend the area since the amounts at stake are so small.</span></p>
<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kaufman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot disregard what my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Mr. Silverman) has said since he has answered an important question asked by the hon. and learned Member for Southport. I was asked "Suppose there had been no local government reorganisation, would you extend the area?" The fact that there has been local government reorganisation does mean that the North-East Derbyshire District Council rather than the Clay Cross Urban District Council is responsible for dealing with the problem. It is the fact—this is not a large matter, but it is illustrative of the problem facing us—that the North-East Derbyshire District Council is now the housing authority for the whole area. Therefore, it is possible for tenants in Clay Cross now, with whatever ease is possible in these matters, to obtain transfers to and exchanges in other parts of that whole district. The same applies in other areas. This is not a large matter, but it explains why this is a problem for the whole of the district council which is responsible for these matters rather than for just a section.<br><br>
I appreciate the difference between us. It is for this reason that, within this difficult problem, we are anxious to allow these successor local authorities—in many cases they will not be successor local authorities—which have inherited these problems to find the way least unsatisfactory to themselves and their electors of dealing with them. In the end, as we said on Clause 1, they are answerable to their electors for whatever method they choose.<br><br>
I assure the Committee that we are examining these questions to see whether there is any further help that we can give to local authorities to deal with this problem. What I am not willing to do—this may not be taken well—is to accept amendments which limit the range of options.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1975V004P0I1020">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 205</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stephen Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to the Minister's argument with interest, but I find it very weak. My name appears on the amendment. I hope that the rest of my colleagues on this side of the Committee will pursue the matter to its ultimate conclusion.<br><br>
Surely the Minister is suggesting or asking for a revolt by rent and rate payers in North-East Derbyshire who had no benefit from the activities of the former Clay Cross Council. The fact that there may have been some transfers or exchanges is unfortunate, but such happenings will bring in very few people rentwise. If such people had had their ears open, they would have appreciated that something like this was likely to happen. The activities of the Clay Cross Council have been public knowledge for a long time. Therefore, those people must have gone in with their eyes open. For the Minister to suggest that this is the reason why the amendment should not be accepted—indeed, the amendment is far more just than the clause as at present drafted—is a very weak argument.<br><br>
Certainly, from correspondence that I have had from the North-East Derbyshire area—I obviously do not have the same close contact with people there as the hon. Member for Derbyshire, South-East (Mr. Rost)—but my contacts there are definitely saying that in no circumstances will they pay any increased rates or rent if they have been innocent parties and are living in an area not covered by the former Clay Cross Council. Could we say that they would not be justified in withholding such payment? We are all getting letters from people who wish to withhold payment of rates, particularly water and sewerage rates. Like good law-abiding citizens, we tell them that they should not break the law and should meet their rate demands. But people in North-East Derbyshire, finding themselves faced with this situation, will feel very angry and rightly justified in not paying the charge. We shall be asking them to pay a charge from which they have not benefited if we do not amend the clause. The argument is very weak compared with the situation which will arise if we do not take the line suggested in the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silverman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that this clause generally depends upon the assumption that the new district councils will act in good faith and act reasonably.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 206</span>
I do not think that a mandatory solution will work. That is the assumption on which we are working in the clause, which I agree is weak. We are doing the best we can. However, the clause is based on the assumption that a local council will act reasonably because it is answerable to its electors.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In what circumstances would it be reasonable for a local authority to impose on rent payers who did not benefit from the defiance of the law an increase in rent now? Why should that power exist?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silverman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That happens every day in local authority housing. Let us take, for instance, the people who default on their rent. That becomes a charge on the housing revenue account which all tenants have to pay. It is very unfair, but they have to pay it. It is a charge on the housing revenue account. That is nothing outrageously new, but I agree that it would be unfair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is completely unnecessary in this instance. There is no reason for this charge.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silverman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a point to which I am coming: is it necessary or unnecessary? The point being made by the hon. Gentleman is that the charge will be put on people who derived no benefit. On the face of it, that is a fair point. I mentioned the small example of people who transferred. In many large boroughs—I mentioned Birmingham—there may be several thousand relets and transfers during a year. Therefore, there may be entirely different people living in the same houses. That is why it is nonsense to identify an area. We get the same kind of outrage with people who move into the area and do not see why they should pay the increased rent. We are not dealing with one or two odd cases, but possibly thousands.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lawrence</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should have expected some assessment to have been made by the Government about the changeover of households from the time that this increase was due. Perhaps we could have that figure now. It would then be easier to discuss the matter.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1975V004P0I1021">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 207</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silverman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I doubt that. It is a complicated operation. In a city the size of Birmingham—it applies to other areas, too—we may get a still greater turnover. It is not a small problem. I think that in Birmingham there were about 6,000 relets and transfers during the year. It is a sizeable problem. People die, leave the area, buy and in some cases have bought their own council houses. What should be done about the man who has bought his council house?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rost</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In Clay Cross?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silverman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am talking about other areas. There may be some in Clay Cross as well. If someone in one of the areas has bought his council house, is the charge to be put on his mortgage? This is a piece of nonsense.<br><br>
Councils could have operated under Section 62 (4) and asked for an adjustment of the rate, if they so wished. Birmingham and others did. Some of the defaulting councils did not do so. In consequence, tenants in those areas have not had the benefit of the deductions that they might have had. Nobody knows what the reduction would have been if it had come into operation.<br><br>
What about rent rebates? This matter is not taken into consideration at all. Some of the tenants might have had a substantial rebate which would have reduced their rents perhaps below the rent that they have in fact paid.<br><br>
I never accepted the extravagant claims made by hon. Gentlemen opposite when we were discussing the Housing Finance Bill. Still, a substantial number of people would have benefited from rebates. That matter is not taken into consideration. Some tenants who are worse off in consequence of a defaulting council's action may find themselves paying increased rents.<br><br>
How do we decide what the relevant rent will be if there has been no adjudication by the scrutiny committee which applies, at any rate, to many of the defaulting councils? We cannot say that, because the provisions imposed upon councils by Sections 62, 63, 64 and 65 of the Housing Finance Act do not set out what the rent should be for a particular house, a global increase should be imposed on the lot. Some might have gone up and others might not. These are some of the difficulties facing us.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 208</span>
If these amendments were accepted, they would in my view create as much hardship and outrage as if the clause were left in its present form. The plain fact is that the local authority, which is answerable to its electors, knows the position and can best cope with the situation. If it is given the choice and flexibility which I understand my hon. Friend proposes, it can best deal with what is an extremely difficult situation. If we can not rely upon the local authority to do that, we will not deal with the matter by imposing this obligation upon it. Any council which is acting in bad faith can easily evade that obligation, as I shall proceed to show at a later state because it would not be in order on this amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rost</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not want to intervene again, but I must express my utter horror at the Minister's reply. It is incredible that he should suggest legislating an injustice and use as the explanation that it would be administratively convenient to do so. Is he really suggesting that in North-East Derbyshire, for example, the 1,400 council tenants who paid less rent than they should have done are not identifiable? Is he suggesting that the new authority has not got up-to-date records of those houses, who lived in them during the past few years, whether the people are still living in them, whether they have died, or moved? It is incredible that the Minister should imply that it would be administratively inconvenient to go through the books and check who owes money and who does not. Is he really suggesting that innocent people should be surcharged because it is tidier and neater administratively? It is intolerable. I have never heard a more incomprehensible argument than that.<br><br>
The Minister, when last in North-East Derbyshire, was reported as having driven through very fast. I am not surprised. I suggest that next time he drives through that area, he had better have an armoured car. It will not do to expect this charge to be foisted upon people in North-East Derbyshire for the reason that he has given—that some may have died and others may have moved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silverman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Nothing is being foisted on the people of North-East Derbyshire. It is now a decision that the district council has to make.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1975V004P0I1022">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 209</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rost</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may not know that the North-East Derbyshire Labour-controlled council has already outlined its policy if this legislation is passed. It will surcharge all ratepayers in the area so that as few of its own supporters as possible will be inconvenienced but as many as possible of its non-political supporters will be asked to pay money which they do not owe in addition to the amount that they are having to pay.<br><br>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
Finally, it is incomprehensible why it should be regarded in principle as fair to do this simply because a few people who originally owed money may have died or may have moved away. There must be an obligation to try to collect debts from those people who owe in the first instance. Nobody is suggesting that anybody should be hounded into other parts of the country, or indeed that there should be any action</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cecil Parkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 25, in page 3, line 8, leave out from 'may' to end of line 9 and insert:
<br><blockquote><p>'by statutory instrument make an order authorising them not to recover that part; and any such order shall be subject to approval by resolution of both Houses of Parliament'.</p></blockquote>
We are rather unhappy about the vagueness of subsection (5). We believe that the provision should be considerably tightened and pay some regard to the principle of accountability to Parliament.<br><br>
I know that the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment will respond avidly to this proposal because I have heard him in his previous incarnation on the Opposition Benches make many first-class speeches about the need for answerability to Parliament and about the fact that too much power is given to Ministers, who should account for their actions to Parliament. I hope that against that background we shall find
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 210</span>
in respect of a deceased's estate. However, an effort should be made and the obligation enshrined in the legislation that debts should be collectible from those who owe them, and only if there are arrears could it be decided to spread them more fairly over a wide area.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has made some telling points. The Minister said nothing to persuade us not to press the amendments. He offered a sort of olive branch by saying that the Government were considering extending the range of options, but he gave no indication what he meant. In view of the absurdity of some of the options which the Government are already providing we have considerable doubts as to their ability to produce new and sensible options.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 6, Noes 7.</p>
<p>some receptive soil in which to plant our seeds this morning.</p>
<p>We believe that it is not good enough for the Secretary of State simply to have to be satisfied and to have the right to decide what he considers to be negligible and at the same time to be under no obligation to explain his actions to Parliament except if asked to do so at Question Time.</p>
<p>The amendment sets out machinery which admittedly is a little cumbersome. The usual channels would not be thrilled by the news that the Secretary of State was seeking an order to release a council from a duty to collect £5. But if the figure were, say, £5,000, Parliament would expect to have the right to be consulted. Therefore, we do not believe that simply to refer to a negligible part should be the end of the matter, or that the Minister should have the right to say, "Let us forget it".</p>
<p>The amendment embodies a plea to the Minister for some form of machinery by which the Secretary of State is forced
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1975V004P0I1023">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 211</span>
to report to the House and to make known to the House what he has done and to explain his reasons. If an affirmative order is not acceptable, we hope that the Minister will take our suggestion away and return to tell us how the Secretary of State proposes to account to Parliament for his actions. Perhaps he will give some suggestions about tightening the definition.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support what my hon. Friend said on this amendment. I wish to emphasise his question as to why such a provision should exist. Why is it necessary? Why should not local authorities have to raise the whole sum of money?<br><br>
Secondly, may we be told what is meant by the word "negligible"? We all know in commonsense terms the kind of matter it must cover, but presumably this could be pressed into some sort of argument. Therefore, we are entitled to be given a definition of the word and to be told how the matter would be interpreted if the provision ever became a matter of dispute.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Law Officers' Department (Mr. Arthur Davidson)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I well understand the reasons for the amendment and I was grateful for the way in which the hon. Member for Hertfordshire, South (Mr. Parkinson) moved it. I agree with him that the terms of the amendment are a little cumbersome.<br><br>
In Opposition I, like my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, many times, although not as skilfully as my hon. Friend, moved similar amendments, particularly where the liberty of the subject was likely to be affected by executive action, but I assure the hon. Gentleman that in this case he need have no fears. I well understand why the Opposition are construing the word "negligible" as they are, but in a somewhat unrealistic way. If, however, there is some ambiguity over the definition in that it may open the way to sums of money being written off which are larger than those intended in the Bill, we shall look at the matter.<br><br>
I assure the hon. Gentleman that the purpose of the provision will not require the recovery of a certified sum down to the very last penny. No matter how diligent a council may be, it is not always
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 212</span>
possible to collect the sums owing to the last penny, and inevitably sometimes a small amount will be overcollected or undercollected. If it is overcollected, it will be credited to the general rate fund, but if the amount is negligible—and I stress that word—it seems right to allow the sum to be written off. It is a somewhat cumbersome and heavy procedure to require both Houses of Parliament to approve the writing off of a few pence or even a few pounds. However, if it is thought that the word "negligible" is ambiguous, I assure the Committee that I shall look into the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Am I right in thinking that when one works out what part of the sum has not been recovered for the purposes of subsection (5) sums not recovered because those who were to pay them have been given a rent rebate are therefore to be deemed, by reason of subsection (6), to have been paid and to be treated for the purposes of subsection (5) as if they had been paid? I think that I should be given a simple answer "Yes" or "No". I think the answer is "Yes". Therefore, we are not dealing with the whole of the amount which has not been recovered, but only what is left over after one adds to the sums which have been recovered the sums which are to be treated as if they had been recovered.<br><br>
The comment I wish to make is that I do not see what is cumbersome about the proposal. If the sum to be dealt with amounts to only £5, surely the usual channels would agree to take it on the nod. If it is a larger sum, we already have a procedure to deal with it. The negative procedure would be better than an affirmative one, and perhaps that would not be regarded as being too cumbersome.<br><br>
I suggest that if the relief of the final balance is carried out by order it has the great advantage that it removes all possibility of uncertainty. In those circumstances no question of what is meant by "negligible" can arise. If a council has been let off the balance in a statutory instrument there is no way of querying it whereas, left as it now is, presumably if somebody thought the amount, in respect of which the Secretary of State made an order under subsection (5) authorising him not to recover it, was not negligible, that person could go to the court for a declaration, as happened in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1975V004P0I1024">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 213</span>
the case of Dore when the ratepayers went to the court to obtain a declaration that Mr. Neville Chamberlain's remission of surcharge was unlawful. Why do we not do ourselves a favour and cut out the possibility either of doubt or of proceedings? We can do it simply by saying that the letting off of that last little bit shall be done by a Statutory Instrument subject either to negative or affirmative procedure.</span></p>
<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Having listened to my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Southport (Mr. Percival), I am almost ashamed to speak in such a casual way about his carefully thought out amendment. We have made clear to the Ministers that we think that the word "negligible" is too vague. We should like to know whether that word appears in other legislation and whether it is a term that is widely understood. It seems to imply a little too much of a value judgment and to leave a little too much to the Secretary of State. Perhaps some financial limit might be inserted into the subsection.<br><br>
On the basis of the Minister's assurance that he will have a look at this and, if he feels the subsection can and should be tightened up will come back on Report, and on the basis that he understands the reason for our disquiet, I beg to ask leave to withdraw this carefully drafted amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 26, in page 3, line 10, leave out subsection (6).<br><br>
The purpose of the amendment is to find out how the subsection operates. The situation can be illustrated in this way. Suppose the council upon which the obligation to recover the losses falls under Clause 2 decides under the powers there given to it to recover those losses by means of a general increase in the rents of its tenants. Suppose, for the sake of argument, that the increase were £1 a week. That would mean that each of the tenants to whom that increase applied would, if the matter rested there, suffer an increase of £1 a week in their rent but each would be entitled to go to the council and ask whether he qualified for a rent rebate. If he did qualify for a rent rebate he would get one.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 214</span>
There may be two council tenants side by side, each subject <i>prima facie</i> to this general rent increase of £1 a week but, because their circumstances differed, one might get a rent rebate of the whole £1 a week while the other had to pay the whole £1 a week. The result would be that although a part of the sum to be recovered would in fact be recovered, part would not, because of the operation of the rent rebate provisions. I understand that subsection (6) is designed to deal with that situation, which undoubtedly will arise in many cases.<br><br>
Pursuing my example, the consequence will be that some of the rent increases will be recovered and some will be remitted by the use of the rent rebate. All those rent increases, both the ones which are recovered and the ones which are rebated, will be treated as if they had been recovered for the purpose of determining the extent to which the local authority has fulfilled its obligation under Clause 2.<br><br>
The authority may say "We know that we have only collected £5,000, but we are to be treated as if we have collected £6,000 because we put on rent increases which would have raised £6,000 but £1,000 has been rebated under the rent rebate scheme." I think that that is how it works, and I understand the reason for it.<br><br>
I realise also that this does not affect the housing revenue account because under Clause 5 (1) as soon as the rent loss certificate has been issued it is credited to the housing revenue account, so that that balances it up. If I am wrong about that, the Minister will put me right.<br><br>
What I am concerned about is that in the circumstances I have suggested there will in fact be a deficit. After the local authority has done everything it is called upon to do under these provisions on the figures I have mentioned, £1,000 of the £6,000 loss still would not have been recovered but would be credited in the housing revenue account as if it had been recovered, because on Clause 5 (1) it is to be credited to the local authority for the purpose of deciding the extent to which it has performed its duties under Clause 2 (6). Nevertheless, that £1,000 is a loss which has been suffered. Where will that loss fall?<br><br>
I notice that in Clause 6 care is taken to make specific provisions about various losses which are not to be taken into
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1975V004P0I1025">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 215</span>
account in calculating the rate support grant. I am thinking of subsection (3):
<br><blockquote><p>"In any calculation of rate support grants, sums charged to any council's general rate fund under section 3 above shall not be included in relevant expenditure as defined by section 1 (4) of the Local Government Act 1974."</p></blockquote>
In Clause 6 (4) there are further provisions that certain sums shall not be taken into account for the purpose of rate support grant. I find no such provision relating to the deficit which will remain unrecovered by reason of the provisions of Clause 2 (6).<br><br>
Generally speaking, deficits are funded from elsewhere if they are lawful. We had reference earlier to arrears of rent, but I do not think that arrears of rent are charged on other council tenants. I think that they are made up in the needs element of the rate support grant. If I am wrong, the Minister will put me right. In this instance there will be a deficit which is not excluded from the calculation of the rate support grant by Clause 6 but presumably has to come from somewhere. Will one of the Ministers please tell me from what sources that deficit will be made up and assure us that it will not indirectly be made up out of the taxpayers' pocket?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Member for Southport (Mr. Percival) will know that the effect of the amendment would be to prevent any rent rebates granted on rent increases from counting towards the recovery. Under the Housing Finance Act the rent increases required comprised both the net rent charged to tenants and any rent remitted from them by way of rebates. They were made up partly of rents to be paid by the tenants and partly by rebates to be paid for by Exchequer subsidy and rate fund contribution. I am sure the hon. and learned Gentleman will agree that it is therefore illogical and unfair to wish to prevent rebates granted in respect of rent increases—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt, but I am the last person to suggest that there should be any interference with the giving of rent rebates. One of the primary objects of the Housing Finance Act was to ensure that councils had rent rebate schemes. I hope I made clear in proposing the amendment that its purpose is simply to find out what other consequences it would have.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 216</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman for preventing me from speaking at greater length than I need. He will know that the method of calculation must be left to the district auditor. That is the Government's view, from which he has not dissented. As rent rebates will have gone towards the rent in the first place, it is only right that they should be counted towards the loss. That is the method, known as the Lacey method, that was used in the Clay Cross audit.<br><br>
I assure the hon. and learned Gentleman that I shall look into the specific points he raised. If I have not dealt with them in this generalised reply I will write to him. Certainly, no loss is to be made up from the Exchequer. I assure him on that point, and I also assure him that no loss will be made up by the taxpayer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has nothing to do with the district auditor. We are dealing in Clause 2 with recovery of the amount certified in the rent loss certificate. The district auditor goes out of it once the loss certificate has been given by him, and he does not come into this exercise.<br><br>
The Minister referred to rent rebates under the Housing Finance Act. I do not quite remember his phraseology, but that is a bad example because rent rebates given under the Housing Finance Act qualified for subsidy, so the financial effect of rent rebates fell upon the taxpayer through the rent rebate subsidy. That was the deliberate policy of the Housing Finance Act. That does not apply in the present situation anyway because that subsidy has been repealed.<br><br>
I should be grateful if the Minister would tell me by letter where this deficit will fall. I am not trying to interfere with the rent rebate systems, I just want to know where the deficit will ultimately lie. If the Ministers will undertake to give us that information—and I see that they are both nodding their heads in the right direction—I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p>12 noon.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When we began our debate on this clause we imagined that we might not vote on this Question, but

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 217</span>
the way the debate has gone leads us to the conclusion that we must vote against the clause. I thank the Minister again for providing the figures, which are very helpful, but they have shot to pieces a substantial part of the clause which we debated at our last Sitting dealing with the length over which the amount of money may be recovered. It is the case that the five-year period of recovery is totally and utterly unnecessary. On that issue we feel that our stance has been</span></p>

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
POWER TO CHARGE RATES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rost</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 27, in page 3, line 19, leave out from 'and' to 'shall' in line 21 and insert
<br><blockquote><p>'any sum charged to their general rate fund by virtue of this paragraph'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be for the convenience of the Committee to discuss Amendment No. 28, in page 3, line 22, after 'chargeable', insert 'and charged by them'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rost</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendment is to specify that any arrears recoverable through the general rate will in no circumstances be recoverable from areas other than those that were originally responsible for the arrears. In other words—I revert to the discussions that we had on Clause 2—we feel that it is a fundamental matter of principle that innocent rent payers or ratepayers should not be obliged to pay fines, penalties, tax or arrears of rent on behalf of other citizens who were responsible for those arrears.<br><br>
It can be argued that the various aspects of this proposed legislation are obnoxious. One can argue about the rights or wrongs of cancelling a disqualification on councillors who acted illegally and irresponsibly. If the Government feel</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 218</span>
<p>more than confirmed. We are extremely disappointed by the lack of response to the important questions that we have raised about the liability of council tenants to pay for the money which was not raised.</p>
<p>I must ask my hon. Friends to vote that the clause should not stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill:—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 7, Noes 5.</p>
<p>desperately strongly that they are right to relieve those who deliberately broke the law from disqualification of holding office it is up to them to argue it. One can argue further about the rights and wrongs of cancelling surcharges. If the Government believe that the surcharges which were imposed by law should be cancelled, that is a matter for argument. We have our views, and the Government must attempt to justify their extraordinary views to the world outside.</p>
<p>However, it cannot be argued that there is any justice in penalising innocent people for the impropriety of others. It will not do to impose penal sanctions on other ratepayers because they happen to live in an area that is now amalgamated through reorganisation. I would have hoped that the Minister, when attempting to answer the arguments raised on Clause 2, would have conceded that proposition. In fact, he made some noises which some of us interpreted as being a move in that direction, but he did not clarify the position.</p>
<p>In moving this amendment I shall put three questions to the Minister. I hope that on this occasion he will attempt to answer them. I hope that he will make some genuine attempt on behalf of the people of Derbyshire, and particularly those living in North-East Derbyshire, to justify the Government's position if he intends to resist the amendments.</p>
<p>My three simple questions are as follows. How can it be fair to let the clause stand as it is? Why should others
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1975V004P0I1027">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 219</span>
pay for the debts of those who were responsible? What happens if there is a refusal to pay? They are the three simple questions that the people are asking, and I believe that we are entitled to an answer.</p>
<p>Many people in North-East Derbyshire have made representations to me because they claim that their voices have not been heard. They have even had letters to the Prime Minister unanswered. They have had letters to the Secretary of State for the Environment shoved off to junior civil servants for reply. I have before me some of those letters. I shall quote examples because I think that this is an important point of principle. If innocent citizens are to be subjected to surcharges they should have the right to express their views and they should receive a proper answer.</p>
<p>One ratepayer from Derbyshire wrote to the Prime Minister on 7th November last. I quote one sentence from his letter, which reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"Will I be given the same soft soap attitude from your Minister if I refuse to pay any additional rates when the time comes for the"—</p></blockquote>
he then refers to the Derbyshire County Council—
<br><blockquote><p>"to institute proceedings to collect the tainted arrears?"</p></blockquote></p>
<p>On 19th November he wrote again to the Prime Minister. That letter reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"Dear Sir, On 7th instant I wrote to you regarding the Clay Cross councillors, enclosing a stamped addressed envelope for reply. I am disgusted, to say the least, that my letter has not even been acknowledged. Why? "</p></blockquote></p>
<p>On 25th November there was a reply from No. 10 Downing Street; it was signed by someone who is obviously not the Prime Minister.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silverman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Did he want an autograph?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rost</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That letter reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"I am writing on behalf of the Prime Minister to acknowledge your recent letter."</p></blockquote>
On 27th November this ratepayer again wrote to the Prime Minister. This was for the third time. He wrote:
<br><blockquote><p>"Thanks for yours of 25th. Have you or the Prime Minister had sight of my letter of 7th instant? If so, I cannot understand why I have not had a reply."</p></blockquote>
On 2nd December there was a second letter from No. 10 Downing Street, which reads:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 220</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"Thank you for your letter of 27th November. Your letter dated 7th November was acknowledged on 12th November."</p></blockquote>
On 6th December this Derbyshire ratepayer wrote for the fourth time. He said that he had received only an acknowledgment and no answer. He then said that he is a pensioner and that he does not like being brushed off in that way, and wanted an answer. Finally, on 12th December, a reply was sent from the Department of the Environment. I shall quote that letter as it is relevant to the point that I am trying to make. The letter was not signed by a Minister but by a secretary. It reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"I have been asked to reply on behalf of the Prime Minister regarding the Clay Cross councillors."</p></blockquote>
I now quote the final sentence, which reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"You will note that the method of recouping losses caused by late implementation of the Housing Finance Act will be a matter for local decision."</p></blockquote>
Obviously that Derbyshire ratepayer is very angry. He has not had a reply from the Prime Minister. He has not even had a reply from a Minister. He has been fobbed off completely. It will not do to attempt to remove an injustice—the Secretary of State suggests that this legislation is an attempt to remove bitterness and rancour—and at the same time to impose an injustice of far-reaching proportions which will be extended over a number of years upon many people who were in no way party to the original indiscretions.<br><br>
I feel that the replies that we have had so far on the reasons for not reclaiming arrears on a selective basis have been grossly unsatisfactory. It is not good enough for the Under-Secretary of State to say that there would be too many administrative problems in collecting or attempting to collect from those originally responsible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silverman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman keeps on talking about arrears and debts. In fact, there are no arrears or debts. The tenants have paid what, as far as they were concerned, was the local rent. The fact that they are beneficiaries as a result of default by the councillors does not make them debtors.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rost</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a point for argument. They were not asked to pay more, and the question could be disputed whether they
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1975V004P0I1028">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 221</span>
should have sought to pay more. What one cannot dispute is that they must have known that they were not paying what they should have been paying. Everyone in the area knew that that was the position. Therefore, they were a party to the illegality. I do not think that anyone, not even the Under-Secretary of State, would attempt to argue that the council tenants who paid less than the law stipulated were doing so in innocence. They were not paying more because they were not being asked for more. For that, we know that the councillors are to blame. However, it is not good enough to assume that they did not know that they were not paying their full wack.<br><br>
I believe that the Under-Secretary of State has conceded the case that I am making. I refer to a letter which was written by a ratepayer in North-East Derbyshire, in the Clay Cross area, to the Secretary of State. He received a reply not from the Secretary of State but from a secretary in the Civil Service. That reply virtually concedes the injustice of what the Minister is trying to do in this clause. The letter reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State for the Environment has asked me to reply to your further letter. The losses might be met by the Exchequer."</p></blockquote>
That is an alternative to collecting them from the ratepayers and rent payers.<br><br>
It reads that
<br><blockquote><p>"the losses might be met by the Exchequer. Such a solution would be blatantly unfair to those authorities who did implement the Housing Finance Act, albeit reluctantly."</p></blockquote>
12.15 p.m.<br><br>
I submit that that is a confession of the complete impropriety of what the Government propose to do. There was an official reply to a ratepayer in the Clay Cross area who complained about the theory of being surcharged. If in reply to that he could be told that it would be blatantly unfair to expect the Exchequer to pay those arrears, it is even more unfair to expect the other ratepayers to pay those debts or arrears. This is a confession of the weakness of the Government's case. It is unfair on other taxpayers and on the other local authorities which complied with the law.<br><br>
Apparently the Government think it is not unfair indiscriminately to surcharge other ratepayers in North-East Derbyshire even though they were just as innocent and uninvolved as the rest of the taxpayers in this country, and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 222</span>
just as innocent and uninvolved as the ratepayers in the other local authority areas which met their obligations under the law. Why is it unfair for other taxpayers to fund these arrears while it is fair to expect ratepayers in the adjoining areas to do so?<br><br>
I do not require answers to those three points for my own satisfaction. I require answers because the people living in Derbyshire have been asking those questions. They have asked those questions in letters to the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State. They have not been answered. They have asked those questions of other Members of Parliament, who have not given satisfactory answers. Those people are now asking me. I have not been able to give an answer because on Second Reading the Minister did not answer the questions. In Committee there has not been so far a genuine attempt to justify the reasoning behind the Government's measures. Therefore if we are to put some sense and justice into this legislation, and remove the bitterness rather than extend it, we must be told why it is fair to deal with the matter in this way, why others should pay, and what happens if they refuse to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lawrence</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment. The Government are saying by means of this clause "In effect, the Clay Cross councillors were right in the stand which they took. We support the Labour movement, in so far as its view was reflected in the National Executive meeting in October 1973, in saying that what the local councillors did was right because they gave effect to the wishes of the people who elected them. Their action was against the law and that matter must be taken into consideration." The Government and the Labour movement would say "Nevertheless, taking all the matters into account, it is right that we should introduce legislation of this kind."<br><br>
That is a point of view. If it has any merit, the Government and the Labour movement should fearlessly face the consequences of their stand. Let them say "We have broken this law" or "We give our support to councillors who have broken this law, because it was an unjust law. Nevertheless, within the rule of law, the penalty must be paid. Let us pay the penalty. Let us be proud of paying the penalty. We do not expect other people to make a sacrifice because
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1975V004P0I1029">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 223</span>
of our principle. We set up a principle and we are prepared to sacrifice ourselves for it." It would be grossly unjust, so the argument should go, to expect people who do not share the principle to make sacrifices. Why do not the Government and the Labour movement do that? The Labour movement stands for this great principle, for which a sacrifice is demanded: "Let us be prepared to make that sacrifice. Let us pay up. Let us not expect people who do not stand by that principle to pay up."<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, South-East (Mr. Rost), in, as usual, a most telling contribution to the debate, asked the Minister to answer the question "Why is it fair to expect the people in a wider rateable area to make payment?" The only answer is that that is not fair. By no stretch of the imagination can it be argued by the Government or the Labour movement that this is fair to people who do not share their principles and who have done nothing wrong.<br><br>
Therefore, the Government are in a terrible mess over this. On the one hand what they propose is not fair. However, on the other hand, something must be done. I asked the Minister to cast his mind back to the meeting of the national executive council of the Labour Party, which introduced a motion which received the approval of the Lord President of the Council, as he now is, and seven members of the Government. While appreciating that the sum involved is £1· 5 million, why does not the noble Labour movement raise the money, or at least make an heroic effort to do so? If the Labour movement raised £500,000 for the purpose people would say that it had made a sacrifice for principle.<br><br>
Approximately 11 million voters voted for the Labour Party at the last General Election. I do not know how many members of the Labour Party there are. I know that powerful trade unions contribute large sums of money to the Labour movement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rost</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They received a rebate of £10 million.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lawrence</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am reminded by my hon. Friend that during the last Session of Parliament the unions received a rebate of £10 million which they might otherwise
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 224</span>
not have expected. That was as a result of legislation passed by the Labour Government.<br><br>
I should have thought that it was a matter of shame for the Government and the Labour movement to have come grovelling to Parliament for legislation which is blatantly contrary to the rule of law. It would have been a matter of principle for those people to have said "The Clay Cross councillors and all the other councillors who stood out against this iniquitous law were right in principle although they were wrong in that they offended against the law. Therefore, let the Labour movement combine and take this stand on principle. Let us be punished and be proud of what we are doing." Have the Government considered that? Has any approach been made to the Labour movement to raise the money? We still have received no answer to the question of what happened to the £7,000 which the Labour movement was to collect for the Clay Cross councillors. Can we have some answers? Was an approach made? If an approach was not made, why not?<br><br>
The attitude of the Government, and of the Labour movement which they represent, is contemptible. That is why I strongly oppose the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kaufman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have discussed these matters and the principles that must underlie this and the previous clause. I do not think it would serve the Committee's progress if I were to repeat the arguments which I put forward with regard to the amendments proposed to that clause.<br><br>
We are not discussing how to deal with the problems left behind by tenants who refused to pay rent. Therefore, the analogy presented by the hon. Member for Derbyshire, South-East (Mr. Rost) of ratepayers who refuse to pay rates is not applicable. We are dealing with the consequences of the actions of councils which refuse to collect rent increases from tenants. Therefore, when the hon. Gentleman asks me what the Government will do about individual refusals by ratepayers to pay increased rates, I must reply that there is no comparison with the objectives of this Bill. We do not seek to deal with the consequences of the refusal of tenants to pay rent increases, because there is no evidence that those tenants refused to pay the rent increases. They
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1975V004P0I1030">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 225</span>
were never asked to pay those rent increases. The local authorities concerned disregarded the Housing Finance Act and did not ask for the rent increases.<br><br>
The Opposition talk about the rule of law. There was no incitement by anybody to tenants, whether of the affected authorities or otherwise, not to pay the rent increases. Some of the tenants paid rent increases. Other tenants were not asked to pay rent increases, and did not pay them. There was no reason why they should have volunteered to pay.<br><br>
I trust that no one will invite ratepayers not to pay their rate increases, just as no member of the Labour Opposition invited rent payers not to pay their rent increases. As a movement, we opposed and deplored the Housing Finance Act. A number of authorities affected by the Bill refused to implement the Housing Finance Act, but there was no mass movement in the country calling upon tenants not to pay their rent increases. Some people in the affected authority areas deplore that. They say that if that had happened they would not now be in their present quandary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rost</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How can the Under-Secretary say that there was no incitement not to pay the rents and that no pressure was put on the councillors to obey the law? The hon. Gentleman must know of the resolution passed at the 1973 Labour Party Conference, since he was there. The resolution reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"Conference further agrees that upon the election of a Labour Government, all penalties, financial or otherwise, should be removed retrospectively from councillors who have courageously refused to implement the Housing Finance Act of 1972."</p></blockquote>
12.30 p.m.<br><br>
That resolution was unanimously adopted. I have no extract from a speech by the hon. Gentleman opposing that. All I have is an extract from the speech by the right hon. Member for Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Central (Mr. Short), who is now the Leader of the House and Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, who spoke in support of it and went on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"Clay Cross is something rather special. It really is. I think everybody in Britain, in the Labour movement and outside, is full of sympathy and admiration for the stand that David Skinner and his colleagues have taken."</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 226</span>
We know the comments of the <i>Law Journal</i> on this matter.<br><br>
We also know that the Leader of the House was quoted soon afterwards on television as saying:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is not our job to go about telling everybody to obey the law."</p></blockquote>
How can the hon. Gentleman argue that there was no incitement?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kaufman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has just confirmed that there was no incitement. That resolution, for better or worse, referred to the actions of councillors who did not implement the Act. There was no word in that resolution advising tenants not to pay increased rents, just as I am sure there is no word going out from this Committee advising ratepayers not to pay increased rates.<br><br>
Our whole approach has been to regard local authorities as responsible bodies—responsible to their own electorates—and, therefore, best able to take the right decisions for their areas. Accordingly, we consider it better to leave the decisions as to the areas over which the certified sum should be made good by increased rates, should they decide to charge any part of the sum to the rates, to the councils concerned. Our proposals allow a council complete freedom to restrict the area of recovery to that of the former council concerned or to spread it over the whole area.<br><br>
That is my response to the remarks made by hon. Gentlemen opposite. We cannot accept the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that we ought to leave all these matters to local authorities. Has he forgotten that to a large extent we are dealing with local authorities which have shown that these matters cannot be left to them as happily as we would like to feel they could be left to local authorities?<br><br>
I want to concentrate on the precise effect of the amendments with which we are dealing. The clause as a whole permits authorities upon whom an obligation to raise money is put by Clause 2 to raise the money through the rates as distinct from raising it by way of rent increases. We are not dealing with the wide question whether that should be allowed, but whether, if councils are allowed to raise the money through the rates, they should be allowed to do so by means of a rate levied on areas which had
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1975V004P0I1031">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 227</span>
nothing to do with the default in respect of which the loss arises. The amendments deal with the right, if right there is to be, to levy a rate, and the geographical extent to which that rate should extend.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, South-East (Mr. Rost) quoted a letter in which a lady in the Department had been explaining why some of the suggestions that a ratepayer made should not be acceded to. Referring to the ways in which the losses might be met, she said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Secondly, the losses might be met by the Exchequer. Such a solution would be blatantly unfair to those authorities who did implement the Housing Finance Act, albeit reluctantly."</p></blockquote>
Is that not exactly the effect that this clause, as it stands, might have?<br><br>
So far as I know, of the constituent authorities in what is now North-East Derbyshire, only one—the old authority of Clay Cross—refused to implement the Act. All the others—there has been no word to the contrary in Committee—did implement the Act. In those circumstances, is not the phrase written on behalf of the Minister equally applicable to the circumstances about which we are now talking as in the context in which it was written? The lady wrote:
<br><blockquote><p>"Secondly, the losses might be met by the Exchequer. Such a solution would be blatantly unfair to those authorities who did implement the Housing Finance Act, albeit reluctantly."</p></blockquote>
Consider the very small differences which have to be made to make that applicable to North-East Derbyshire. Suppose it had read:
<br><blockquote><p>"Secondly, the losses might be made good by levying a rate on all the inhabitants or ratepayers of North-East Derbyshire. Such a solution would be blatantly unfair to those old authorities in the area who did implement the Housing Finance Act, albeit reluctantly."</p></blockquote>
I ask the Minister to think again about this matter. What is said about this power to levy a rate over the whole of the new area may be summarised by saying that it is both blatantly unfair and patently unnecessary. It is blatantly unfair for the reasons adumbrated by my hon. Friend.<br><br>
Will the Minister, even now, face this situation? Surely it is plain that it is so unfair that it must cause bitter resentment to some of the ratepayers upon whom the increased rate would fall if a local authority exercised the power in the widest form in which it is given under this clause.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 228</span>
Will the hon. Gentleman face this situation? Suppose a ratepayer genuinely said "I feel so bitter about this matter—I played my part in electing councillors to carry out the law, and so on—that I will not pay." What should happen? Should the full rigour of the law be visited upon that person? What would the Minister's arguments be if that person said "Why relieve the Clay Cross councillors and others of their refusal to obey the law? Their only justification was that they felt very strongly about it. I feel every bit as strongly as they felt. Why should not I also be relieved when I feel equally genuinely and strongly about it? "
The Minister will get himself into a dilemma if he is not careful, a dilemma which the Government have not yet faced. We accept that it is not possible to find a solution which is fair to everybody and will not be unfair to somebody, but at least the Government should have the good sense not to word the Bill so that it may be unfair to a greater number of people than is necessary. If the Government are not careful they will be storing up the seeds of some very nasty problems.<br><br>
How do the Government expect the court to act if a ratepayer is brought before it for not paying his rates in the circumstances that I have mentioned and he says "But I feel every bit as strongly about this matter as did the councillors of Clay Cross, and I have got good reason. I did my best, I obeyed the law, and now I have been clobbered with this increase." He might even say "If it were being raised from taxpayers all over the country, that would not be so bad. But why me? I have nothing to do with it. Simply through geographical accident and the stupidity of the Government I am being asked to ante up for something for which I had no responsibility and got no benefit from."<br><br>
What does the Minister expect the court to do about that? Will he call on the court to do what the Government have not got the guts to do—to say that the law is the law and that it must be applied? We do not seem to have got home to hon. Gentlemen opposite that what is being done by the Government undermines the rule of law. Parliament cannot break the law: it creates the law: but Parliament has a greater duty than anybody else to support and uphold the law, not to undermine it. Next down the scale are elected representatives on local authorities. They,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1975V004P0I1032">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 229</span>
like everybody else in a position of authority, have a duty to support and uphold the rules of law, not to undermine it.<br><br>
That is why the acts of the councillors in these cases were so much more serious than an individual engaging in the same kind of activity. We are proposing to let off the councillors in whom such conduct is more serious, but we expect the victims of these provisions to carry them out and, if they do not obey the law, that the full rigour of the legal process should be employed against them. It is blatantly unfair and it is asking for trouble.<br><br>
Suppose the council tenants of Clay Cross carry out their threat of a rent strike and do not pay the increased rent which may fall on their shoulders. What action will the Government expect? Will they expect the local council to turn the tenants out for failing to pay their rents? Will they ensure that that happens? If not, if the Government do not ensure that council tenants acting in that way are dealt with, what will individuals who feel the full force of Clause 3 say about that?<br><br>
The idea that a council should use the powers in this clause to levy a rate on all its ratepayers to make good a loss raises many possibilities of unfairness. One can only suppose that no responsible authority would use those powers. That is what we thought in the past. It did not occur to anybody that any responsible authority would act as have the authorities with which we are now trying to cope. That an area like North-East Derbyshire with a Labour-controlled council might levy a rate over the whole area so as to lessen the impact on certain people and have less adverse political consequences to itself is a possibility which we must now accept.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rost</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They have said that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They have said that they will do it. The motivation makes the point important. We should not leave it open to councils to do that. The amendment would preclude them from doing so.<br><br>
I said that this proposal was blatantly unfair and patently unnecessary. Now that we have these figures—my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison) has referred to them—we can see that the whole thing is ludicrous. I have had more time to do my mathematics than some hon. Members. As I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 230</span>
see it, even if our amendment is carried so that a rate can be levied only on the defaulting area, the consequence in case No. 1 on this schedule would be a farthing rate—one-quarter of a penny in the pound.<br><br>
I am referring to the case where one is limited to the defaulting area and still has the power to levy over five years. Why on earth should it be necessary to go wider than that so as to reduce the obligation? With the exception of two or three cases, the obligation is of that sort of order.<br><br>
12.45 p.m.<br><br>
We referred earlier to the word "negligible". Most of the amounts are negligible. This will cause us to think again about what we have said about the period of five years and to consider whether a period of three years is not too long. I hope that now the Government have these figures worked out they will look at the situation in the context of this clause and also in the light of the time limit.<br><br>
I have worked out the sums as follows. I am limiting myself to rates in order to keep within order. Suppose that the whole of this money were collected in one year rather than in five years. That would be a rate of £1· 25 in example No. 1—that is an actual rate of £1· 25 on every £100 of net rateable value. Therefore, somebody occupying a house with a net rateable value of £200, which is quite high for areas out of the city centres, would be paying £2· 50 in the year—that is 5p per week—to clear the whole thing off in one year and without extending the rate beyond the confines of the defaulting area. Some would amount to an even lower figure. I notice one example, example 13, where the average rate poundage increase would be · 05 of a penny. I make that 25p per year per £100 of rateable value, if it were all to be collected in one year.<br><br>
In those circumstances how can the Government possibly justify spreading it over such a period of time and of giving everybody the right to do so? I do not put out of my mind the fact that they can collect it quickly. If there were an option lying between collecting the sums quickly or slowly, I have no doubt where I should put my money.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1975V004P0I1033">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 231</span>
Why should there be such a long period of time in which to collect the money? Why is it necessary to go outside the defaulting area? Is it not clear, now that we have the figures, that the right thing to do is to confine the area to the defaulting area and to shorten the period? In that way we can clear up the whole matter so much more quickly. I hope Ministers will bear in mind that the longer this goes on, the wider the area over which one spreads the collection, the more one risks giving rise to one unfairness after another and to bitter feelings. Therefore, I hope that the Government will look seriously at these amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kaufman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I note the tone in which the hon. and learned Member for South-port (Mr. Percival) addressed the Committee, and I would not wish to appear to be discourteous by not responding to what he said, but there is little I can add to my earlier remarks.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Gentleman put a case which does not lack logic. Our case does not lack logic either. As on so many occasions in the consideration of this Bill, it is a matter of judgment. I do not quarrel with Opposition Members for preferring their judgment to ours. I hope that they will not be too severe in their strictures if we prefer our judgment to theirs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Percival</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Judgment must be exercised on facts. There should be some process of reasoning leading to a judgment. I do not think the Minister would disagree with that proposition. If he has not applied his mind to this matter he should at least let us know the conclusions on which he has arrived at his reasoning in respect of even one of these examples. Could he give any reason at all why it is necessary to go beyond the confines of the defaulting area? None of these sums could represent any hardship to anybody. Can he say why it is necessary to go beyond the defaulting areas on which the burden would fall so lightly, as we now see from his own figures?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rost</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I noted the reluctance with which the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment got to his feet and his even greater reluctance to deal with—</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 232</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kaufman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Fitch. I indicated to the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison) that I was willing to rise to speak if the Committee wished me to do so, but when another hon. Gentleman rose I thought it more suitable that he should speak and that I should respond at the end of the discussion. I would not wish it to go out from this Committee that I am unwilling to respond to arguments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rost</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure the Committee would like to hear from the Under-Secretary of State, and I am pleased to give way to him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kaufman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I took it that Opposition Members would wish to complete their argument collectively and that I should respond then, rather than that there should be a discursive question and answer session.<br><br>
I do not deny that the arguments advanced by the hon. and learned Member for Southport contain some cogency. If that is the case, they will commend themselves to the local authorities concerned, and no doubt they will study what has been said in this Committee. If they share his views, it will be most sensible to collect the sums quickly—and within the affected area it is open to them under the Bill to do so. The sums in many cases are small. It may be that the local authorities, who may not have seen these figures before—I had not until today—may regard it as sensible to do what the hon. and learned Gentleman suggests. We are anxious—this has been one of the Government's objectives throughout—to carry the local authorities with us on this measure. Because of this objective we have provided them with the options. If hon. Gentlemen regard their arguments as cogent, there is no reason why local authorities should not accept them. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent the local authorities from conducting themselves in the manner suggested by the Opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again we have to clear the air as to the purpose lying behind an option. The Opposition have made an effective case today—namely, that ratepayers who are not involved in this business should not now have to bear the charge. It is a rather feeble response for the Minister to say that there is no
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1975V004P0I1034">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 233</span>
obligation to have to bear the burden because local government is capable of taking sensible decisions.<br><br>
There is no need for this provision and we must press the matter to a vote.<br><br>
I wish to make a few brief comments on one or two other points. The provocative nature of the Government's proposals has been amply demonstrated. We are absolutely against ratepayers refusing to pay their rates—I am happy to make that quite clear—but it is a provocative—and entirely unnecessary provocative—approach which the Government are permitting under this legislation. I beg them to think again. If they will not think again now, I beg them to think about the matter before Report. The Government are putting forward measures which are bound to produce a worsening situation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Parkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend no doubt noticed the Minister's frank admission that the Government had not seen the figures until today. Perhaps in the light of that new information they realise how foolish it is to spread the sums over five years or to give that option.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is on a very good point—there is no need to spread the matter over a five-year period. The figures show clearly that the sums at stake do not begin to warrant a five-year repayment period.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silverman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Have we not disposed of the argument about the five-year period?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a matter which comes under this clause as well as under Clause 2. Although it is true that amendments were grouped under Clause 2, this matter is of crucial importance in Clause 3. By raising the point now we may avoid the need for a long debate on the question. That the clause stand part of the Bill.<br><br>
It seems to us unnecessary to provide such a long period for repayment. The Minister argued that local authorities would be sensible and say "We shall do this at once," but we demonstrated in previous debates that in the matter of</span></p>

<p>timing there is considerable advantage in spreading out these matters. Over a period of five years the inflation rate will cause the value of money to fall sharply and this will mean less of a cost to ratepayers, and indeed to rent payers if spread over five years.</p>
<p>The Minister sought to give the impression that nobody in the Labour movement had tried to encourage the councillors in their defiance.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kaufman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was the impression the hon. Gentleman gave. We shall look carefully at his words. While I agree that the present Secretary of State did not do so, I believe that there were people in the Labour movement, and, indeed, in the Parliamentary Labour Party, who encouraged this defiance. The fact that the present Leader of the House accepted a resolution referring to the courageous stand of the Clay Cross councillors was some encouragement to that defiance. The hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr. Atkinson), as the then Chairman of the Tribune Group, said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Labour councillors are equally right to ignore the Rent Bill"—</p></blockquote>
so he called the Housing Finance Act—
<br><blockquote><p>"and to stand by the principles upon which they were elected."</p></blockquote>
There was no doubt that there were number of Labour Members who went a long way to support the rebels in this matter.<br><br>
Let me return to the basic principle—a point already well made by my hon. Friends. The fact is that it we allow this alternative to go through, particularly if it is coupled with a five-year repayment period, we shall succeed in prolonging the bitterness which the Government say they are trying to bring to an end. Unless the Minister can at this late stage produce serious reasons why we should withdraw our amendments, we are bound to press them.</span></p>
