<p>11.2 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. T. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 27, line 12, at the end, to add:
<br><blockquote><p>"(4) If any agreement of tenancy contains provisions restraining the tenant from ploughing up permanent pasture and the landlord refuses within fourteen days of receiving an application in writing from the tenant on that behalf to agree to the unconditional waiver of those provisions, the tenant may apply to the County Agricultural Committee to appoint an arbitrator who shall decide whether the tenant shall be permitted to plough up the said pastures either unconditionally or on such conditions as he may think fit."</p></blockquote>
If hon. Members have read the Amendment, which stands in the name of the Member for North Cumberland (Mr. W. Roberts) they will see that it is so simple as to require little or no explanation from me. We have information to the effect that in many cases the tenant condition leaves the landlord with full power to determine whether or not the tenant shall be able to take advantage of the facilities afforded by this Bill. If farmers all over the country are turning over grassland because they deem it right to do so, they are responding to the national call. Wherever a tenant, whose conditions of tenancy leave all the power with the landlord, desires to turn over his land and the landlord objects, the tenant ought to have the right to apply to a county agricultural committee to appoint an arbitrator to decide the issue.<br><br>
I hope that the right hon. and gallant Gentleman will not feel disposed to resist this very modest Amendment, which, I gather, applies infinitely more in Scotland than it does in either England or Wales. Perhaps some hon. Members representing
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1172</span>
Scottish Divisions who are either owners or tenant farmers will be able to supply the right hon. and gallant Gentleman with ample proof of the need for this particular Amendment. The whole of these series of Measures providing subsidies for farmers ultimately must safeguard the rent of the landowner for the moment. The tenant farmer, who is the person responsible for farming the land and making the best possible use of it, who knows the need perhaps more than the landowner himself, and who is concerned more with the production of food than he is with the social amenities of the land, ought to be permitted to decide whether or not his land should be allowed to be ploughed up. It is for these reasons that I have moved the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Joseph Lamb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member has said that the tenant should have the right to apply to the county agricultural committee, will he explain to what committee he refers in the case of Scotland?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that in Scotland there is a parallel to the county agricultural committee in this country. I understand that tenancies are so very different and much tighter with regard to the tenant farmer in Scotland than is the case in England and Wales, hence my suggestion that the Amendment applied perhaps more to Scotland than to England and Wales.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Riley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In supporting the Amendment I should like to ask the Minister whether the Clause as it stands is mandatory or whether it is only permissive? That is a very vital part of the issue which is raised in this Amendment. I support the Amendment for another very laudable reason. It seeks to embody in the Bill a principle which agricultural reformers have been demanding for more than half a century. I seem to remember that about half a century ago, there was a well-known slogan known as the three is in the agricultural world—"Fair rent, fixity of tenure and freedom of cultivation." It will be clear to Members of the Committee that this Amendment raises the question of the tenant having reasonable freedom of cultivation and that he should not be prevented from such benefits as this Bill may confer by the caprice of the opposition of the owner. I hope, therefore, we shall
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0583">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1173</span>
have a clear lead from the Minister as to whether, as the Clause stands, an opposing landlord would be able, under the existing contract of tenancy, to prevent this proposal being put into operation by a tenant? On that we ought to be quite clear. If the Clause does not give the power to the tenant to take advantage of the provision it is reasonable that it should so be amended that the tenant should have the right to apply to the agricultural committee against any opposition by his landowner. There is rather an interesting point raised in the Clause on which I should also like the interpretation of the Minister. In the first two lines the Clause says:
<br><blockquote><p>"A ploughing grant to be made in respect of any land shall be made to the person at whose expense the land has been ploughed up, and has been or is being or is to be dealt with as aforesaid."</p></blockquote>
I should like to know whether that implies that the owner may, if he thinks proper, take on the responsibility of the ploughing. If the farmer is not disposed to do so, can the owner override the wishes of the farmer and carry out ploughing and thus receive the grant? Those are points on which it would be useful to have the guidance of the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of Pensions (Sir Walter Womersley)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I might clear the air a little so that we may get on to something that is far more important than this matter, although it is not quite as simple as the hon. Member for Don Valley (Mr. T. Williams) has said, as I am sure he will realise on reflection. This is in effect something to bring about a major Amendment to some very important Agricultural Acts. I refer to the Agricultural Holdings Act, 1923, and the corresponding Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Acts, 1923 and 1931. This Bill is only a temporary Measure to deal with the present situation, and is not the occasion to go into the big question of landlord and tenant and to alter Acts of Parliament which have been considered and passed by this House. This is not a Bill to alter the whole system of the law of landlord and tenant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a Bill to guarantee rents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir W. Womersley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Even if this was not a temporary Measure, I doubt whether it would be advisable, in a Bill such as this,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1174</span>
to deal with the vast question of landlord and tenant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rather suspect that the hon. Gentleman is going to waste the time of the Committee if he tries to make out that, merely because there was an Act passed in 1923, and another in 1931, affecting landlord and tenant, that now, in 1939, sixteen years later, the Government should come along and say that every tenant in the country who desires to plough up land shall receive a gift of £2 per acre for so many months in the year. If he suggests that that is a temporary measure and ought not to disturb tenancy rights and agreements, why are these Clauses in the Bill at all? Why invite tenants to plough up land for a national purpose in case of a national emergency, and then tell us that this is a major Amendment that ought not to be imposed in a temporary Bill of this kind? We are only applying this Amendment to this temporary Measure. This would not apply to the whole gambit of the Bill and the whole of the 40 Clauses, but exclusively to the Clauses dealing with the ploughing up of land.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir W. Womersley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister set out to get 250,000 acres of ploughed up land. He has 150,000 acres now, and the remainder looks like coming along without much difficulty. As a sensible course he sought the co-operation of all concerned in agriculture, including, of course, those who represent the landowners. The Central Landowners' Association and the Land Agents' Society in the early days expressed their willingness to co-operate with the Minister in promoting the ploughing up of grassland under the scheme that he outlined to them, and we have evidence that that co-operation has been forthcoming. There has not been a complaint from anyone that a landlord has withheld his consent, and we are satisfied that we shall get the remainder of the ploughed up land without the slightest trouble. Therefore, I suggest that it is really not worth while to go into the big question of altering three very important Acts of Parliament when we have no difficulty in this matter. We want to preserve the good feeling that now exists among those who are engaged in all branches of agriculture and to get on with the job, and I am sorry that in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0584">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1175</span>
the circumstances we cannot accept the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to have to follow the Minister with a few suggestions which indicate that actually this can become, as he realises, quite an important Amendment. It is on that ground really that he is resisting it. Once you admit the principle of the cultivator having the right to initiate the use of the land it might very well not become part of a temporary measure but a permanent feature of your agricultural legislation. It is right that it should be so. At some stage it will have to be recognised that the landlord has ceased to have the initiative of the proper use of land in this country. One hundred years ago the landlord was the person, and it was the great landlords of the past that settled the rotational system of the land in this country. But that is breaking down. The pressure on Governments to-day is going from the user of the land. A few years ago we should have had the pressure of landlords exercised in this Committee room in a way we have not had it exercised now. They are quite satisfied that the National Farmers' Unions of Scotland and England are capable of looking after their interests and the interests of the farmers.<br><br>
During the last 100 years the tendency has been for the initiative in the use of land to pass into the hands of the actual users. The good landlord is not threatened by the Amendment. He realises that he can leave a lot to his tenant; but there is a class of landlord creeping into the industry who is acquiring poor land for the purpose of maintaining a sort of sporting interest in it, and many tenants throughout the country are being affected by the power which this type of landlord is exercising over the use of land.<br><br>
There is another aspect of the matter which must be taken into account. The Minister has said that they have 150,000 acres at present and he expects to get the whole, but if there is going to be any change of tenancy in the next few months it is not clear who is going to get the subsidy in the end. There is going to be a disturbance of tenant right expectations in this matter before we have gone very far. We have not settled the matter by the fact that there are 150,000 acres
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1176</span>
on offer and possibly another 100,000 acres coming along.<br><br>
What is wrong with the Amendment from the point of view of the Minister? Surely, he wants to deter nobody from ploughing up land, and the kind of land that he wants ploughed up is land which is often in dispute between landlord and tenant. The tenant does not ordinarily regard poor land with any satisfaction. He wants to have a go at it, but the landlord will not let him. I have a case in mind of a man who wants to plough up 100 acres and the landlord is stopping him. It is comparatively poor land, the class of land which wants turning over every five or seven years; but it is extremely good partridge country and good rabbit country. It is a very convenient lump of land for giving sanctuary to sporting life, and the landlord realises it, but the tenant does not. He would like to see it under the plough but the landlord is resisting him. I cannot see that the Amendment impinges on the rights of a good landlord, but it does protect, the interests of the user of the land who wants to take advantage of this scheme and cannot. They do not put forward their claims because the landlord is in the way.<br><br>
It will be interesting to see what kind of increment you get from tenants who are being restrained by their landlords. There is no shadow of doubt that there is a volume of land which could be ploughed up but which is being restrained by the action of the landlords for one reason or another. The Amendment would enable them to qualify under the Bill, and I cannot see why we should seek to protect the interests of any sort of landlord against the tenant in a Bill of this kind. The Minister said that the Bill is a temporary measure. It may be a temporary Bill, but the land which is affected by it is permanent grass land, and the effect of the Bill will be permanent. If you accept the Amendment you will enable thousands of acres of land to get into good cultivation and enable a class of tenant to take advantage of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Riley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister cannot dismiss the Amendment in the airy way he has tried to dispose of it. He has not attempted to meet the points which have been put. He has not told us whether a landlord who has a contract of tenancy
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0585">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1177</span>
with a farmer not to plough up land would be able to enforce that condition after the Bill becomes law. Is a landlord entitled to defeat the purpose of the Bill? That is what it means. The Minister must be interested in the facilities of a farmer to make the best use of the land of which he is a tenant. There are tracts of land in the occupation of farmers which would be beneficial if they were turned over and which the farmer would like to turn over but cannot under the existing law. This Amendment is designed in the interests of the nation to give the farmer freedom to turn over land for the benefit of the community and the farmer himself, and we should know quite definitely whether the Government are content to allow private owners to stand in the way of a proposal which is for the benefit of the consumer and the country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tinker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, the Clause gives a ploughing grant and the Amendment asks that the tenant should be allowed the privilege of an appeal to the county agricultural committee. We are not asking that the tenant should have full power; he must appeal to an arbitrator. Surely, that is worth listening to. We are trying to give the tenant an opportunity to develop his land and if the landlord has certain provisions which the tenant thinks harsh, surely he should have a right to appeal to the county agricultural committee? It is not asking too much that he should have the right to appeal to this body to give him liberty to develop his land. I hope we shall have some better reply from the Government. The Amendment may be opening up a very big question, but we are dealing with the Bill, and whatever questions it raises should be considered. I hope the Government will consider the Amendment on much graver lines.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. A. V. Alexander</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am becoming more and more confirmed in the view that the Government are rapidly earning the title of the landlords protection society. Only a few hours ago in the early hours of this morning the Government refused to refrain from accepting a Lords Amendment to the Civil Defence Bill making the poor tenant pay more of the cost of providing air raid shelter; a nice little bonus to the landlords of 25 per cent. When we ask in this Amendment for legal protection to the tenant farmer the Development Bill
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1178</span>
Government refuses to accept the proposal. That seems to me to be an extraordinary position. The Minister of Pensions said that the Government were anxious to get the maximum result and had sought the co-operation of all people concerned. If that is so I am intrigued as to what is behind a later Amendment on the Order Paper which is in quite a contrary direction, and which is designed to give further legal protection to landlords. I shall be interested to see the attitude of the Minister of Agriculture towards that Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Brig.-General Clifton Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It does not give further legal protection.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At any rate the hon. and gallant Member is not satisfied with the position in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lieut.-Col. Acland-Troyte</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Are we discussing the next Amendment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am replying to the point made by the Minister that he cannot accept this Amendment because he has sought the co-operation of the landlords as well as of the tenants.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think the right hon. Gentleman must confine himself to the Amendment and make his points when we reach the Amendment to which he has referred.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely, our objective is to carry our Amendments and, therefore, I think I am entitled to reply to the Minister when he says that the Government cannot accept it because they desire the co-operation of both sides of the industry. The objective of the later Amendment is to give further legal protection for landlords which does not exist at the moment, otherwise there is no point in putting it on the Order Paper. Therefore, the Minister is in a very difficult position. I think any authority would agree that the ploughing out of old pasture could be a completely sound proposition without any subsidy at all if it were not for the restrictions which are to be found in a large number of tenants' leases. The whole objective of the Government will be missed unless those restrictive clauses can be removed in reasonable circumstances, and that is all we ask for—that a tenant who has been refused permission to plough out should have the right to appeal to his local agricultural com-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0586">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1179</span>
mittee. It has been pointed out to me by one who is experienced in Scottish farming that permanent pasture is not a farming, a botanical or a practical term at all, but merely a legal term for land which the landlord forbids a tenant to plough. The one thing likely to hold up 100 per cent. achievement of the object of the Government is a failure to provide legal protection for the tenant where permission is refused by the landlord. I should have thought that hon. Members opposite, many of whom claim, and no doubt think they rightly claim, to represent the interests of the farmer far more than those of the landlord, would have been upon their feet and vocal in favour of giving this reasonable permission to those who are the majority of their agricultural constituents. I hope, therefore, that the Minister of Pensions, when he replies in his usual breezy style, will pay particular attention to the point raised by the hon. Member for Dewsbury (Mr. Riley). If the Government persist in supporting unreasonable and unnecessary restrictions upon farmers obtaining the opportunity to use the Government subsidy, we shall be forced to divide the Committee, and those who represent farmers will have to be depicted as voting against their interests.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir J. Lamb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I admit that I have a certain amount of sympathy with this Amendment, but I shall ask my hon. Friends opposite not to press it on this occasion, and for this reason. It has been said that this is not a big question, and it is not, but it is a big principle, and a principle for which I have a certain amount of sympathy. It is not a big question because the application is so restricted in this case. The Amendment applies only to land which is to be ploughed by the end of October. There will be very little time for this provision to work. Consequently, we shall be trying to apply a principle in such a restricted way that it is not worth taking up more time over it. I suggest to hon. Members opposite that they should allow this to pass now and deal with it on another occasion. It is to be admitted that we shall find some landlords who are inconsiderate in this matter, but the vast majority will be in favour of the land being ploughed up. There will be very few who will not be willing to assist. Landlords will favour it for this reason
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1180</span>
if for no other, that if the land is ploughed up it will place the farmer in a better position to pay his rent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I ask how the hon. Member for Stone (Sir J. Lamb) has evolved his argument that it is not worth while pressing this matter on this occasion? It is now the nth July and I have no doubt the Minister hopes to get the Royal Assent for the Bill before the House adjourns for the Summer vacation, judging by the way he is flogging us to get it along, but we have already heard from the Minister of Pensions that although many months have passed since the first announcement of the Government's policy they are yet only within sight of attaining three-fifths of their objective, and the last date is 31st October. Surely, the Minister of Pensions has shown that this is the time to put in this provision. If the Amendment is inserted and the Bill becomes law before the end of the month the tenant farmer can give notice in writing to his landlord afresh and within 14 days can demand an appeal to the county agricultural committee and may get redress in time to plough before 31st October. I think, therefore, that if the hon. Member for Stone is really in sympathy with the tenant farmer he has presented the case for the Amendment in his speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir W. Womersley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First let me deal with the point raised by the hon. Member for Dewsbury. The Clause is permissive, and if there is a clause in the agreement between the landlord and the tenant under which the landlord has power to restrict, that will still apply. It is a legal undertaking which was entered into by the tenant before he took the farm, with a full knowledge of all the circumstances, and I suggest that we cannot in an Amendment to a Bill such as this deal with the question of breach of contract. My hon. Friend the Member for Leigh (Mr. Tinker) said that he did not know much about farming, and I do not claim to know a great deal, but I do know something about the sanctity of contracts, and I feel that if he as an official of a trade union had entered into a contract with the other side and then, in a small Bill, it was sought to set aside that contract, he would complain bitterly. The question at issue is whether there is any need for this Amendment. My right hon. Friend the Member for Hillsborough (Mr.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0587">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1181</span>
Alexander) talked about getting these arbitration cases through in 14 days. He knows better than that. He knows what it means when you have to apply to a committee and ask them to appoint an arbitrator. If there were many cases—though in my opinion there would not be many—what chance would there be of getting the matter settled in time for ploughing before 31st October?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not say he could get the arbitration through in 14 days. I said that after the Bill became law the tenant could give 14 days' notice to the landlord and then make his appeal. If the Bill becomes law by the end of July there will be three months in which to do it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir W. Womersley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a good debating point, but it is not a practical point. The right hon. Member knows that the expenses of the arbitration would have to be borne by both sides, the tenant paying his share. It would be a costly business, and I very much doubt whether any small farmer would go to the trouble and expense of arbitration over the question of ploughing up a few acres.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. J. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would any landlord allow himself to be drawn into arbitration if he knew the tenant had this right?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir W. Womersley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am certain he would. If he felt strongly that he did not want certain land ploughed up he would surely go to the trouble of defending the application when it came before an arbitrator, because I cannot imagine any sensible landlord raising an objection unless he had good solid grounds for it. We must take account of our experience up to now. So far we have had no difficulty whatever, we do not anticipate the slightest difficulty and we do not want to create difficulties. Therefore, I would ask</span></p>

<p>Clause ordered to stand part of the Bill.</p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1182</span>
<p>my hon. Friends opposite to withdraw this Amendment. It will not achieve the purpose they have in mind and will create difficulty and trouble, and as we are getting on so well would it not be better to leave things as they are and let us get on with the Bill?</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I regret to hear the second statement of the Minister of Pensions. The time is never ripe to do anything which may disturb the peace and equanimity of the landlord. He says: "After all, it is only a little thing for which you ask; why press it?" That was also the line of the hon. Member for Stone (Sir J. Lamb)—that it is a big principle but applies only in a small way under this Bill, and so why press it. Ever since I have been in Parliament it has never been the right moment to deal with the landlord. Either the principle is too big or it is too little or the time is inopportune. Now the hon. Member for Stone says: "Leave it to-day and sometime in the dim and distant future"—when he and I are no more—"somebody will probably deal with this big principle in a little Bill." It is the old story, and I hope my hon. Friends will vote against the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilfrid Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to apologise for not being here to hear this discussion, and I do not want to intervene now except to say that if I understood the Minister right there has been no difficulty over this matter up to the present. I take it that no cases have come to his notice in which tenants have been prevented from ploughing out land. If that is so, what is the harm of adding this1 Amendment, which might be useful in a few cases?</span></p>

<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Brigadier-General Clifton Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 27, line 35, to leave out from "to," to the end of the Clause, and to add "accordingly."<br><br>
The concluding words of the Clause are:
<br><blockquote><p>"The grant shall be taken into account as if it had been a benefit allowed to the tenant in consideration of his executing the improvement or cultivations, and the compensation shall be reduced to such extent as that person considers appropriate."</p></blockquote>
It seems to be the intention of the Subsection that the £2 subsidy should be deducted from the compensation claim by an outgoing tenant for re-seeding, and it leaves the amount of the deduction at the discretion of an arbitrator. We suggest that that intention is carried out by the use of the word "accordingly."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Ernest Shepperson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to reply to the objection which I know is going to be made by the hon. Gentleman opposite. He is going to assume that this is another gift to the landlord, because this amount of compensation is not going to be paid to the outgoing tenant but is going to be paid to the landlord. The object is, however, simply to bring about equity as between the outgoing tenant and the incoming tenant, and if the compensation is not received by the outgoing tenant it will not be paid by the incoming tenant. The landlord, as between the two, is a mere agent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. J. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Are there not occasions on which the landlord has an interest in the tenant right—occasions, for instance, when there is no incoming tenant for the time being, or when the outgoing tenant has gone out at the wish of the landlord for some reason or other? Has the landlord then any interest in the operation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir E. Shepperson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The fact that the landlord comes in protects the outgoing tenant, because, if the landlord did not come in, the outgoing tenant would get no compensation in a case in which there was no incoming tenant. Therefore, the intervention of the landlord is an assistance to the outgoing tenant, enabling him to be sure that he will get his compensation for tenant right.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1184</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What happens when a landlord seeks to take possession of his farm?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir E. Shepperson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Then the landlord has to pay compensation for tenant right to the outgoing tenant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Dorman-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I understand this Amendment, its object is to make certain that in all cases the compensation shall be reduced by the £2. I am afraid we could not possibly agree to that, because there are many cases where the improvements will not be really worth the amount that the tenant has had to pay. For example, in the case of a field which has been neglected, and small bushes have commenced to grow on it, probably ploughing twice and clearing, including harrowing, would be necessary, which might cost up to £3 an acre. Seeds may cost £1 15s., and sowing 10s., making a total cost of £5 5s. At the end of that, the improvement in the pasture might only be worth round about £3 an acre. In that case the outgoing occupier would have lost about £2 5s. an acre, and it ought to be open to the arbitrator to decide whether he shall give anything to the outgoing tenant, and how much he will give. That is to say, there should be a discretionary power. I am certain that it must be agreed that special circumstances may arise, and that it should be left at the discretion of the arbitrator to decide what is fair and right as between the outgoes and the incomer. I hope the Amendment will not be pressed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Brigadier-General Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the Minister's explanation, for which I thank him, I beg leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p>11.50 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Brigadier-General Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 27, line 36, at the end, to add:
<br><blockquote><p>"(3) Where for the purpose of enabling a ploughing grant to be made to a tenant under this Part of this Act a landlord gives his consent whether before or after the passing of this Act to the ploughing up by a tenant of permanent pasture which the tenant is restrained by the terms of the agreement of tenancy under which he holds from ploughing up without the consent of the landlord, and the condition or one of the conditions on which such consent is given is that the tenant shall agree to lay down to permanent pasture before
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0589">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1185</span>
a date specified in the consent the land so ploughed up or any other land not exceeding in area the land so ploughed up, the agreement to lay down to permanent pasture shall be binding on and enforceable against the tenant according to the terms thereof."</p></blockquote>
This Amendment raises somewhat the same question with hon. Members opposite as the last Amendment, but they must realise that, of the land of England, 60 per cent. is under the landlord and tenant system at the present moment, while in the case of 40 per cent. landowners are farming their own land. The hon Member for Doncaster (Mr. J. Morgan) has said something about many landlords not taking an interest in their fanning and knowing about it but the same applies, unfortunately, to some tenants. It must be remembered, too, that landowners include a great many public bodies, who are not likely to be willing to forego the leases or contracts they have made with their tenants any more than anyone else.<br><br>
The whole object of this proposal is to keep the land in the state in which it ought to be, that is to say, fertile and capable of producing crops. Unless there are these contracts which have to be fulfilled at the end of a lease by handing back the land under grass as it was at the beginning, we may lose what other countries have lost through not having proper control of their land by loss of fertility and erosion, which latter is luckily absent in most parts of this country, but needs watching. The object of the Amendment is not to get more concessions, but to keep what has already been granted under the Act of 1923. It would make it clear that this temporary measure of ploughing will not break into existing rights of contract between landlords and tenants, and that, whether the owner is a public body or a private individual, the lease must be carried out when the tenant goes and a new tenant comes in. Section 30 of the Agricultural Holdings Act gives a tenant freedom in regard to cropping and the disposal of the produce of arable land, notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary; but such an agreement is not enforceable by the landlord until the last year of tenancy, and it is not clear whether the permission to plough up and re-seed would in fact convert the land to arable for the purposes of that Section.<br><br>
We want this point to be made quite clear. If you have, as I have, a dairy
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1186</span>
herd, you must have a certain amount of grass as well as arable, but, unless it is made quite clear, as is not the case in the Act of 1923, it may enable the tenant to contract out of the agreement as to the condition in which he is to hand back the land when his tenancy is over. The only way in which the landlord can be made sufficiently secure is by the insertion of an Amendment of this kind, making an agreement enforceable at any time notwithstanding Section 30. We only want to keep these agreements as they stand at present when there is a change of tenancy, and to enforce the maintenance of the fertility of the soil as part of the duties of the landowner. Probably in many cases he is farming his own land, with tenants alongside him, and it is in the interest of all of them to see that these agreements are carried out. In the case of a farm consisting partly of arable and partly of grass, it would be of no use otherwise as a dairy farm. It must be made clear that you cannot contract out of the Act of 1923 by this temporary Measure, and that the same rules should be enforceable as are at present enforceable under the Act of 1923.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Price</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not quite understand what the hon. and gallant Gentleman is aiming at. It seems to me that on the one hand he is arguing that the landlord should have the right to enforce the maintenance of the fertility of his farm, but, on the other hand, he may also prevent an increase of fertility by any new method which the tenant may think he may carry out. Why is it necessary to consider that certain land should go back to permanent pasture? I can conceive that in certain districts it might be considered that the best means of conserving the fertility of the soil is to have temporary leys only—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Brigadier-General Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Price</span><span class='membercontribution'>: —and to have the land going up every five or six years. Why should there be this insistence that the land should go down to permanent grass?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Brigadier-General Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On my own farm, for instance, as on that of the hon. Member, which I believe is also a dairy farm, a certain amount of grass is necessary, and if the farm is to be continued as a dairy farm, for which the buildings and so on have been arranged, it must be left in the same state, with a certain
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0590">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1187</span>
amount of grass, a certain amount of arable, and so forth. That is necessary for the proper arrangement of a dairy farm.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Price</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In my opinion it is better to leave that to the tenant, and not to the landlord. I cannot see any reason for giving a landowner a right of control in these matters. I am afraid that it may be abused, and that he may use it to prevent new methods from coming in. I understand the point of view of the hon. and gallant Gentleman, but I think it might be rather a dangerous thing to introduce.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Dorman-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Minister of Pensions has said, the Bill does not vary any of the terms of existing tenancy agreements, and, as I understand it, the object of the Amendment is to ensure that, where a landlord makes it a condition of ploughing up that the land shall be re-seeded, that condition shall be enforceable. I am advised that such a condition is enforceable at the present moment, and that the Amendment is really entirely unnecessary. I hope for that reason that it will not be pressed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. J. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister's interpretation is correct, there will be many cases where tenants will get an out-of-hand permission from the landlord to plough up their land; the relationship is so good. I am now talking of day-today business. We know that the Minister himself has hesitated to direct the user of the land how he shall seed it afterwards, and has made it plain that he would like the land put back into grass if he could get it. But he has left the matter open, and the directions in other parts of the Bill are such that a large proportion of these tenants and users of land will undoubtedly put their land under oats, barley and other crops in order to take advantage of the other Clauses of the Bill. In order to take advantage of the other Clauses of this Bill he holds out a bait to these people. The tenants have a day-to-day or out-of-hand arrangement with their landlords, and they find at the end of the tenancy that because the thing is obscure they are suddenly called upon by the landlords—and it is a desperate thing to face at a time when a tenant is finishing his lease—to put the land back into its original state.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1188</span>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Dorman-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If it is an actual condition that the land should be re-seeded it is enforceable, but if the landlord gives an unconditional right, then the tenant cannot be forced to put it back into grass. It is merely a question of the terms and arrangements come to between landlord and tenant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that in order to hurry the business of the Committee we are not going to slur over undertakings of this kind. This is a serious matter for many farmers. The one consideration at the back of the mind of tenants to-day over these proposals is the uncertainty of their ultimate relationship with the landlord. It is no use blinking the fact. There are many men trying to come to terms with landlords in order to take advantage of this arrangement, and I agree with my right hon. Friend the Member for Hillsborough (Mr. Alexander) that, in view of the attractiveness of these proposals, and the season, it is a matter of surprise that the Minister has not got his full 250,000 acres by this time. He ought to have done so, and should have expected 500,000 acres. I believe that when he introduced the Bill he had a larger number of acres at the back of his mind, and hoped that there would be no limit to the number. He ought to have got more acres. I am confident that a lot of people are holding back because they are not sure of their ultimate position in relation to their landlord. I should like the Minister to be certain that he is not involving a lot of good men in difficulties by his attitude. A landlord meeting his tenant in the market place might say, "Oh! well, Jack, you go ahead, I shall not have any objection." Then three years from now the tenant is suddenly brought up against the terms of his agreement, perhaps at a time when he has his land under oats or some other crop, and is reminded that no matter what was said in the market place a few years ago, the agreement must stand and he must go back to the original position.<br><br>
I rather suspect that the hon. and gallant Member for Newbury (Brigadier-General Brown) has been better advised in this matter than the Minister. It looks as though the Central Landowners' Association have been in consultation about the agreement, and that they are certain that the Bill, in spite of what the Minister says, impinges on the Agricultural Holdings Act, 1923, and that the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0591">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1189</span>
tenant, once he has been allowed to plough without the condition being imposed upon him, must get back to the original condition of the land as far as cropping is concerned under this Bill. As I say, the hon. and gallant Member is probably better advised than the Minister in this matter, and tenants would be advised to respect the view of the hon. and gallant Member rather than that of the Minister. I can see difficulties arising three or four years from now, although I am resisting the suggestion of the hon. and gallant Member because of the principle that we lay down on this side of the Committee that the user of the land at this state in our agricultural history is entitled to get what livelihood he can out of the land, because the landlord is only the recipient of rent and has not really to engage in the economies and capital costs of farming. Therefore, we are behind the tenant in this matter, but I hesitate to oppose the hon. and gallant Member on the same ground as the Minister that there is nothing here that changes the landlord's position. I am supporting the Minister, but for quite a different reason.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Dorman-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. J. Morgan) had any legal advice on this question?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I see conflicting legal advice evident in this Committee, and I am at least in contact with the practice on the subject—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Dorman-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So am I.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr.Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: —and that very often is something which does not appear to be the legal position. There is certainly a conflict of legal views evident in this Committee, judging by what the hon. and gallant Member has said.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1190</span>
The object of this Amendment is to make it clear that the Minister may make arrangements with manufacturers and dealers in agricultural machinery under which they would undertake to hold increased stocks of machinery in times of peace on condition that those increased stocks were purchased by the Minister on agreed terms in the event of war. At the present moment it is doubtful whether we could do that under the Clause as at present drafted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the right hon. and gallant Gentleman say whether this Amendment simply means that all kinds of agricultural tractors or machinery and equipment can be purchased now or at any time before or during a war to be placed in cold storage and only to be used when an emergency arises.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think it would be more convenient if the hon. Member would put this question on the Motion "That the Clause stand part."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. J. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What does the Minister mean by agricultural machinery? Does he mean agricultural machinery right down to seed drills? Does he mean cultivators, ploughs and all the apparatus for putting any crop into the ground? Is that what he has in mind? He puts in the word "acquisition." Acquisition by whom? By both parties to the agreement? Does the Minister himself propose to acquire the machinery, or is he going to authorise other people to acquire it in his name? He is not actually to purchase it at the moment, but should he require to purchase it, he may take it off their hands. If they can dispose of it elsewhere are they free to do so? It does not seem that the Minister is to acquire the machinery, but that he is to get other people to do so, and to hold the baby in case he should want the baby at a later stage. That seems to be the purpose of the Clause of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Dorman-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think the scheme that we have in mind is well known to the Committee, as it was debated on the floor of the House. The scheme in general is that we shall purchase the tractors, which will be stored by agents throughout the country, and they will be kept turned over in the ordinary course of trade. Neither the tractors nor the machinery which we in-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0592">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1191</span>
tend either to purchase, or to enter into an agreement to acquire if war breaks out, will be used unless war in fact breaks out and an emergency is upon us. In answer to the other question asked by the hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. J. Morgan), this deals both with tractors and the machinery which will be used by tractors, so that we have all the machinery there to be put in use directly war should break out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richards</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does that mean that the Minister of Agriculture is to have a lien upon the machines and is not buying them outright?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Dorman-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are two methods of doing it. One is to buy outright, and the other would be to get the agents for the various bits of machinery to keep extra stock and to pay them so much for storage and for keeping it, but it would not be ours. We could enter into an agreement, if war broke out, to buy the extra stock. Is that clear?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir J. Lamb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. and gallant Friend is asking us to train women in tractor driving, and I understand that he is to supply the tractors for that purpose. Will some of these tractors be available before war breaks out for the purpose of training women to work on the land, or are we to get the tractors from some other source?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Dorman-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Special tractors are being bought for training women, but they do not come into this sort of arrangement. It would be a separate lot of tractors.</span></p>
<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Dorman-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 28, line 12, to leave out from "stocks," to "authorised," in line 14, and to insert "acquired by the Minister shall be held by him until the disposal thereof is."<br><br>
The arrangement made for the establishment of a reserve of tractors provides that the tractors shall be sold back to the manufacturers when the reserves come to be liquidated. We want to sell them back, and we have made arrangements so that we can get the best possible price and terms. Therefore it seems to me to be inappropriate to put in the Bill, as is the case at present, how the stock should
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1192</span>
be liquidated, but when it should be liquidated.</span></p>
<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>
<p>Further Amendment made: In page 28, line 17, leave out "Sums representing the," and insert, "Any sums received by the Minister representing the net."—[<i>Sir R. Dorman-Smith.</i>]</p>
<p>12.13 p.m.</p>
<p>Question proposed, "That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill."</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask the Minister one or two questions. When this matter was debated on the floor of the House we got the idea from the Minister that, having secured the right to purchase, rather huge purchases of tractors would be made at a cash price, that the terms would be extremely good from the point of view of the buyer, that there would be no merchants intervening, and that the tractors or machinery would be set on one side pending an emergency. Subsequently, if the right hon. and gallant Gentleman felt that deterioration was setting in, he could come to this House with a small Bill to acquire power to dispose of the tractors that were deteriorating. The scene seems to have changed slightly. Merchants and agents are being brought in, or at least that would appear to be the case from the terms of the Amendment and the statement made by the right hon. and gallant Gentleman this morning. For the sake of clarity, I hope that he will tell us whether or not the purchase has been, is being, or has to be made directly from the producers of these tractors or machinery, or are we to understand that since the power was given by this House to make these purchases merchants have been brought in, and that some third party is to take a rake off on this transaction? Originally, we thought in terms of tractors but now we are told it is to be all kinds of agricultural machinery.<br><br>
I understand it is going to work out something like this. It may be that ten thousand units of something will be purchased. They are to be dispatched by the maker to agents; they are not necessarily to remain within the factory for any length of time. As the factory owner can supplement existing supplies the agents will sell the tractors or machinery originally belonging to the State at reduced prices because they are now shop soiled, and their place will be taken by the new machinery and tractors. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0593">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1193</span>
Minister of Pensions may see these things clearer than I can. I know the Minister of Pensions and the party he represents and their commercial instincts, and I know that they will lose no opportunity of enabling somebody to make a profit out of any contract that is made. But we are anxious to know how the scheme is going to work out. Are we to buy in bulk, despatch them to agents, and then when second supplies are available, the agents who had the first supplies will sell the first supplies and retain the last supply for a certain commission? If that is to be the method, then I hope that terms and conditions will be laid down between the Minister and the agents who are to sell these shop soiled tractors and agricultural machinery.<br><br>
We want to ascertain these terms and conditions, not in any way to prevent the scheme going through. I should prefer the right hon. Gentleman to buy millions of pounds worth of tractors and other machinery direct from the factory and then retail them to tenant farmers at the most modest price he can possibly do. I would not hesitate to cut out the middlemen, if it would enable a farmer to get tractors for 50 per cent. of the price which he now pays. I should prefer giving the fanner the means whereby to do things rather than a subsidy. We want to know exactly what the right hon. Gentleman visualises will be the administration of this scheme. We are not hostile to it but we want to know how it is going to work and to what extent agents and outsiders are going to make a profit at the expense of the State.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Henderson Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Clause divides agricultural tractors from machinery and we have had no explanation at all on that matter. What machinery has the Minister in mind? He must have taken some advice on the matter. Obviously, the machinery will vary according to the different parts of the country, the kind of crops grown and, perhaps, according to the amount of labour available and whether the labour is highly skilled or otherwise. I notice that in Sub-section (2) the Minister may vary the stocks of machinery. What has he in mind there? In the agricultural machinery section of the Royal Show there were lines and lines of extraordinary machinery, and every day new inventions are coming along. I saw a machine for planting vegetables which I gather
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1194</span>
may cause a small revolution. Is there provision here for making a full use of new machinery?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tinker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It has been rumoured that some of these stocks may come from sources other than Great Britain. I do not know whether there is anything in the rumour, but I hope the right hon. Gentleman will assure us that these stocks will be acquired from British manufacturers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Turton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to know from the Minister what is going to happen to a tractor-mower. I am interested in it because there has been an invention by a constituent of mine for mowing grassland. Will that be included; and will the machine for mowing grass behind the tractor be included? It is a new development which is going to revolutionise a certain type of farming, and it would be very good to have that reserve in time of war, when we shall undoubtedly be very short of labour. On the Second Reading the Minister said that the Department and the Agricultural Engineering Association were working out a detailed plan. Can he give us any more news of that plan; and particularly in regard to price, has he a firm assurance that prices will not be raised?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. J. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think the Committee generally is rather worried as to the scheme on which this Clause is really based. It looks as if it was based on an agreement with a firm which does not make agricultural machinery and whose agents do not stock agricultural machinery. The right hon. Gentleman seems to have entered into an agreement with Messrs. Fordson, who only make tractors.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Dorman-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And we are only buying tractors from them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not the total point. Are you buying all your tractors only from that firm? There are other tractor interests in the country, and there is no subject on which farmers have more definite views than on tractors. There is a new tractor coming on to the market which is well in advance of Messrs. Ford-son with whom the Minister has made his model agreement. Is he tied in any way by that agreement? Can he approach any other firm, or has he been attracted to this particular firm by the services
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0594">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1195</span>
which they can render through their agencies throughout the country? That must be an administrative attraction to the Minister. It is quite clear that he has not made anything like the same provision for other agricultural machinery as he appears to have made with one firm for tractors. Can he give us the information which will satisfy us on this point? It is going to be comparatively easy to handle on a revolving commercial basis the purchase of tractors, but what kind of a scheme has he for handling the various forms of agricultural machinery through all the various agencies which exist on a revolving commercial basis?<br><br>
Has the right hon. Gentleman any scheme worked out? Farmers laugh at the idea to arrange for tractors without tackle. Where is the tackle? The Minister may have made provision for it, but he cannot have done very much, because £1,500,000 is not going very far. The dreadful thing is that farmers will think the Government have made all provision for meeting emergency ploughing up and will say that they need not do anything, and when the emergency comes you will find whole parishes wanting tractors and cultivators and mowers, That will hold up the programme, and what is more there will be whole parishes in the West of England where they will not have the personnel who will know how to plough and handle machinery because they have gone in for milk so much.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope the hon. Member will confine his remarks to the Clause, which deals with the reserve of agricultural machinery.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is clear the Clause may turn out to be a big hoax, as far as emergency circumstances are concerned. What we are dealing with is an agreement made with a particular firm and we would like to know whether it is applicable to other firms, and whether the scheme had been worked out for revolving the machinery on a commercial basis through the agencies with which farmers are in contact, and whether the Minister has taken steps to work out a much more substantial scheme in conjunction with other machinery interests? He might have set up an Agricultural Machinery Advisory Committee; I rather hope he has. It is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1196</span>
clear, however, that the Clause is based on an agreement which he has reached with a particular firm supplying agricultural machinery.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Major Braithwaite</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to say how much the farming community appreciate the provision which the Minister has made. It is very vital that we should have proper reserves behind the agricultural industry, and this Clause will provide them. But there is going to be a great demand for increased land drainage, and I hope that some machinery for land drainage will be included in this reserve of storage. I should also like to ask whether he has made any provision for the storage of fuel for these tractors? There will be a great demand for fuel should an emergency arise, and I think that the agricultural industry should have its own reserve of fuel. If some provision is made for storage we can proceed without delay. Some of these machines require special fuel, not of the general type on which ordinary internal combustion engines run, and it might be of the greatest value if a reserve were kept. I want to thank the Minister for this provision. It is a far-sighted policy and the nation may be glad at some time of what has been done.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Dorman-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. J. Morgan) may be surprised to hear that even the Minister of Agriculture has thought of some of the points he raised. We do realise that a tractor without a driver and without a plough is not very much use to the farmer, but we are convinced we can have the tractors and the machinery and somebody sitting on the tractor to drive it. As far as the agreement we have made—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. J. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is no answer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Dorman-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have not finished yet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But you were passing away from that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Dorman-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As is known, we have entered into an agreement for a number of tractors from Fordson's. They are in a position to give us quick delivery and are the biggest manufacturers in this country. We have made an agreement for a certain number, but it is not exclusive, and it is open to us to make agreements

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1197</span>
with other firms or for them to approach us. As to the question of merchants intervening, no merchant does intervene in the actual transaction. We are dealing directly with the producers. One of the difficulties, as everyone will recognise, is that of storage. When we get the tractors into store we have to see that they do not deteriorate, and there are two methods of doing that. We could build storage accommodation, have men to look after them and pay the whole cost, or we could get the agents of the various firms to take into stock an increased number of these tractors and let their skilled men look after them. With the help of the agents, who have co-operated very well indeed, we have got accommodation with them for the requisite number of tractors, and we shall make a small payment to them to keep the tractors in order.<br><br>
This is what will happen. Say I am an agent and that I generally keep in stock one tractor. I may now keep three in stock, two of them being on Government account and one on my own account. I sell a tractor to, say, the hon. Member for Doncaster. He gets it at precisely the list price, less discount for cash, and then one of the Government tractors takes the place of that which was sold, the agent taking it over at the list price and bringing in another tractor from the factory.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May we understand what "the list price" means? I should have thought that, as the Government were making these extensive purchases, they would be able to get the farmers better terms.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Dorman-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not talking about our stock, merely the actual stock which goes out from the agent himself. Our terms are another question. The agent is not making out of this. He is really performing a useful public service by looking after these tractors and keeping them in condition for a very modest payment. The hon. Member for East Fife (Mr. H. Stewart) asked about the machinery negotiations. They are going on at the moment and are in an advanced state. We are having advice both from the Agricultural Institute at Oxford and from the Agricultural Engineers Association. In the very nature of things we are dealing mostly with the ploughing-up and the breaking-up of the land and the tackle which will be required for the purpose.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1198</span>
Here is a small list of the things we shall have to have—ploughs, disc harrows, manure distributors, rolls, seed harrows, and that kind of thing. I saw any number of attractive machines at the Royal Show, and one would like to have a chance of buying them, but the Vote is limited, and I have to provide for the things which will be needed for ploughing-up the land.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. H. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister confine himself and his successors to ploughing-up machinery?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Dorman-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. We have tried to get all machinery which is necessary for our purpose. The hon. Member for Leigh (Mr. Tinker) asked where the machines would come from. I can give this absolute assurance, that as far as we can we shall deal with the home producers, though naturally there may be some specialised types of machinery which we shall have to get from abroad.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tinker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If we in this country can produce the type of machines that are wanted, our producers will get the first chance?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Dorman-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Oh, yes, as long as the trade plays fair with us over this game, and that, I am sure, is understood.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ridley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if I am obtuse, but I cannot follow to its conclusion the operation of selling these tractors. The Minister assumed the case of an agent who possessed one tractor in his own right and stored two others for the State. He performs the useful service—and I do not deny that it is useful—of selling tractors and replacing his stock from the stock of State tractors as he sells his own, in that way preventing the deterioration of the State stocks. I should like the Minister to complete his story by telling us the price. My right hon. Friend the Member for Hillsborough (Mr. Alexander) assumed that in a large-scale transaction like this the State would be able to buy at much below the normal list price, and would be able to buy its two tractors at a price, considerably lower than the agent, operating in only a small way, had to pay for his one tractor. May we know at what price the agent is able to acquire the State tractor when he transfers it to himself after having sold his own tractor? I will put it this way: Tractor No. 1
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0596">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1199</span>
belongs to him, and there are tractors Nos. 2 and 3 which he stores for the State. Then we will assume that he sells to my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster Tractor No. 1 which a week before may have been a State tractor—that is before he sold the tractor before No. 1 tractor. At what price?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Dorman-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The list price.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ridley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And at what price does he then acquire the State tractor No. 2, which meanwhile he has been storing? If the State has not bought it at something considerably below the list price the State has bought badly indeed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Dorman-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It should be clear that the State has not started trading in tractors. The agent who has got his one tractor which he normally carries in stock deals with Fordson's in exactly the same way as he always has dealt with them. The question of the price at which we are buying our stock does not enter into that transaction at all. The agent is in exactly the same position <i>vis-à-vis</i> Fordson's and the farmer as ever he was when selling his own tractors.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ridley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Then that means that tractors are merely being peddled through a large number of small factors instead of the State using the opportunity of buying a considerable number of tractors at a figure below the list price?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Dorman-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have entered into an arrangement with Fordson's to buy X number of tractors, a large order, and instead of delivering them all in London they are to deliver them to their various agents. As they come out of the factory they go to the various agents. It is still a bulk order as far as the State is concerned. Does that make it clear?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ridley</span><span class='membercontribution'>; At what price?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Dorman-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not going to disclose the price.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely, the farming community are entitled to know whether the Government are going to make a profit out of them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Dorman-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But we are not selling.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1200</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Government give a bulk order for tractors at below the list wholesale price, what are they going to do with the margin? Why should not the farmer get the advantage of bulk purchases? I do not think the Minister has given us anything like the amount of information we ought to have. We are being asked to vote the money. If the Government have been quoted by Fordson's a substantially lower price than is charged to factors who deal at wholesale prices before selling at list prices, we ought to be satisfied that the Government are not making a profit out of the farmer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Dorman-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It does not become a sale from the Government at all. I am perfectly certain that the right hon. Gentleman does understand the thing, and understand it very fully. We are not selling tractors to farmers, and the agents are in exactly the same position as they were before. They are merely storing for us the tractors which we have bought on a bulk order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Riley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In other words, the farmers are not to have cheap tractors and the usual profit of the trade is reserved for the merchants?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. J. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister tried in the early stages to ride off pretty cheaply on my account. I take it that we are arranging for tractors on some postponed delivery basis, and I think I am satisfied on that point, but I note that the amount of money is £1,250,000, and realise that under emergency conditions the Minister might have to buy 1,000 tractors. In that case I should like to know where the machinery, which is the more vital consideration, is to come from. We have had no evidence at all of any machinery being included in the scheme. The Minister may say that he has thought of all that, as though it was not necessary for me to point it out. He may possibly have negotiated the machinery side of it, and be able to tell us that he has thought about the plough and the person who is to use the plough, but we are discussing the actual proposals and the only proposal we have actually heard about—and I saw the sneer creep over the faces of hon. Members opposite—was the reference to tractors being used to train the Women's Land Army. That is the only evidence we have that the Minister is going to train people to plough.

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1201</span>
I did not sneer; the sneers came from the other side. If we were caught out in September we might find that we have not made any real arrangements under the agricultural machinery side of the scheme, that the Minister had been called upon to fulfil his obligation to pay for the tractors he had ordered in advance, and that the money was insufficient to buy any agricultural machinery for use with the tractors.</span></p>

—(Payments to Agricultural Mortgage Corporation.)</div> <!-- title -->
<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 28, line 30, to leave out "either by way of grant or".<br><br>
In the Second Reading debate I hazarded the remark that these words did not convince me very much because I felt, having regard to the experience of the last ten years, that the insertion of the word "loan" means nothing at all unless the word "grant" is taken out. We shall no doubt see, as in the past, that, when there is the alternative of a grant or a loan in nearly every case it becomes a grant. The objective we have in mind is to get much more information from the Government than we have yet received. I was struck with the position of this matter on the Second Reading, when the Minister, in a long and no doubt able speech, devoted some 20 or 30 lines to his explanation of Clause 32. He simply said that, as there had been a fall in money rates, the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation were unable to finds means of lending money at remunerative rates, and therefore would require this money to put that right; and that they proposed to spend £60,000 per year for 20 years. The request to the House of Commons to provide a direct cash subsidy of £60,000 a year, on top of the £32,000, for 20 years, is a large and important matter. In the first place, it justifies our description of the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation Bill of 1929 as a bankers protection Bill. I want to ask the Minister a number of specific questions on this matter.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1202</span>
In the first place, is the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation now composed of representatives of the banks? In other words, is it, as we assumed, a bankers' corporation? In the second place, is the Corporation's capital of £650,000 subscribed by the banks? I observe that in the Act of 1929 we undertook to advance a sum equivalent to the capital of the Corporation, and, in fact, that sum of £650,000 has been advanced. Has that £650,000 been advanced as a part of the fund to be lent, or has it in fact become the actual capital on loan of the Corporation, and has no money in fact been subscribed for the capital purposes of the Corporation by the banks? I should like to be clear on that point. In the next place, before we pass a subsidy of this kind, we ought to have much more evidence from the Minister as to the need for it. We have had nothing but the general statement that it has been impossible to lend money at remunerative rates. There have been three issues of debentures by the Corporation—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Dorman-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order. I wonder whether we could take both the discussion on this Amendment and the discussion on the Clause standing part, together?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have certainly no intention of pursuing the same argument again on the question that the Clause stand part. If we have any points to raise on the Clause standing part, they will be purely new points that may arise out of any statement of the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the right hon. Gentleman moving the deletion of the Clause?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, he is moving his Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Turton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can we have a very wide discussion on the Amendment, so as to cover the whole Clause?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, if that is the wish of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The position with regard to finance is that there have been three issues of debentures—one of £5,000,000, one of £3,500,000, and one of £2,000,000. Part was issued at par at 5 per cent., and part at 4I per cent. but at an issue price of 95, which makes the return round about £4 15s. per cent. If
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0598">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1203</span>
we are now asked to provide an additional annual grant by way of subsidy for the interest rates on the debentures—because that is what it amounts to—may we know what is the actual amount outstanding on mortgage? I think we are entitled to know that. What is the sum at the disposal at this moment of the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation for lending, which it cannot lend unless it gets this grant to make up the difference between the rates it can obtain from the farmers and the rates it must pay on the debentures? These were issued, apparently on a very bad basis, because there is only a sinking fund operating from the present year, 1939, and it is only at the rate of ½ per cent. Might we know, in relation to these debentures, the rates which we are to subsidise, what is the average interest that is being received at present from the farmers? My impression is that, at any rate, in the earlier part of the lending operations of this corporation, rates of interest as high as 6 per cent. were charged. How much is outstanding at 6 per cent., and what is its relation to the total lending? Surely, if we are to be asked to vote £60,000 for 20 years, we ought to know the financial facts, about which we have not had a word.<br><br>
It is a pretty hefty thing to be asked to vote money to subsidise this position if perhaps large blocks of farmers who were the most keen effectively to capitalise their farms, and who entered early into the scheme, are still being charged far too high rates of interest. Surely, that is a reasonable request from the people who have finally to vote on the matter? We have not had a word of detail on it so far. I admit that in ordinary circumstances, if we were given, as we sometimes used to be, a reasonable opportunity during the normal hours of the day for debating a Financial Resolution, much of this argument could have been put on the Financial Resolution, but at the end of such long Debate as we had on the Second Reading it was perhaps not reasonable to expect us to sit all night discussing details of the Financial Resolution because of a matter of this kind. I am not at all certain at the moment that the purpose of this is not entirely to save the bankers.<br><br>
I asked a question, I think, on the Second Reading as to the manner of float-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1204</span>
ing the debentures, and also as to the exact position of the debenture holders to-day. How are the debentures distributed? Are they all held in general by individual members of the public, or are they taken up in large blocks by the banks who are represented on the directorate of the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation? What is the position of the Whitehall Securities Trust, who are in some way, apparently, secured by a trustee? They may, of course, only be acting as trustees, at an annual remuneration, for the debenture holders. I do not know. All that we know, from such research as we can make ourselves—not from matter supplied to us by the Government, and it is not very easy for private Members—is that apparently all these debentures have been issued in this way through a trust acting in some way as trustees for the general debenture holders. At what remuneration? I think we are entitled to ask that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Dorman-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: £100 a year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For the whole £10,500,000?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Dorman-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Whitehall Trust get £100 a year for their trusteeship.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope the Minister will make quite sure that that applies to the whole of the three issues. In that connection, may I ask also whether the Whitehall Trust holds any of the debentures, because it would not be usual, if they were acting in the capacity of a trustee, for them to be debenture holders themselves. May I ask, further, what it is proposed to do about the outstanding amount of expenses for the flotation of the debentures? As far as I can see, from such scanty accounts as I have been able to obtain, there is £150,000 of the issue expenses still outstanding as a liability? How is it proposed to deal with that? Before we decide on our attitude with regard to the Clause, we are entitled to detailed information of the kind for which I have been asking.<br><br>
Another point is that the debentures at the higher rate of interest—the £5,000,000 at 5 per cent. issued at par, have been dealt in on the Stock Exchange, according to the last 12 months' returns, at anything from 103 to 122,½ and it becomes all the more important that we should see who took up those debentures. Did the banks take them up; have they been disposing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0599">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1205</span>
of them at this rate of profit; and are we now to guarantee the maintenance of interest? In the case of the portion of the debentures that was issued at 95 at the lower rate of interest, averaging 4¾ per cent. in round figures, the price on the market in the last 12 months has been from no to 114. Who held those debentures, and, if they were held originally by the banks, at what sort of prices have they been disposed of? If my experience of banks teaches me anything, the great banks do not usually do these things at a loss. I said so on the Second Reading of the Bill of 1929, and I say so now. We are being asked really to guarantee them against a possible loss in current financial dealing, although they may have made—I do not know; I want to know; I am entitled to know—large profits from the disposal of the debentures from time to time. I think we ought to know that.<br><br>
Of course, there is the point in relation to the remuneration of the capital if it is subscribed by the banks, and I am asking whether it is. I observe with interest that only on one occasion during the period of operation of the Corporation did interest inure to the holders of the share capital of the Corporation, at about 2½ per cent. That is why I thought that perhaps they have subscribed the capital, because otherwise dividend would not have been paid in that way. Nothing has been paid since. Of course, there were in the Act of 1929 certain provisions with regard to that interest, and yet there is nothing in this Clause, as far as I can see, which safeguards us in regard to the interest to be paid in future on the shares, having regard to the additional subsidy. I was intrigued by the somewhat sketchy reply that was made to me on the Second Reading by the Secretary of State for Scotland. I make no complaint. It was late at night, and he had a lot to get through in a short time. But, if I recall his words, he made a reference to the Government's intentions. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is proposed to make it a condition that so long as the corporation is in receipt of these payments, it shall not pay dividends on the share capital except with the consent of the Minister and the Treasury. It is intended to make that stipulation."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 15th June, 1939; col. 1672, Vol 348.]</p></blockquote>
Where is that in the Bill? How are you going to make such a condition? What is your authority for making such
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1206</span>
a condition? All these matters are points of substance and of very great importance, and I hope that, although we have not the benefit of the presence of a representative of the Treasury in the Standing Committee this morning, the Minister has come at least with sufficient information to be able to satisfy us upon this very technical but important point. If not, my case would be not merely to vote against the Clause standing part of the Bill, but that we should adjourn discussion of the Clause until we receive what we are entitled to receive on this financial transaction, namely, proper Treasury information.</span></p>
<p><i>Sitting suspended at Two Minutes after One o'Clock until Four o'Clock.</i></p>
<p><i>On resuming</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Price</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In my view this is the most unsatisfactory Clause in a Bill which otherwise has some useful features. It is true that it can be regarded as the harvest of the very bad seed sown in 1929, when the Agricultural Credit Act was passed and the Agricultural Corporation was set up to enable farmers to purchase land or to carry on their operations with the aid of so-called cheap credit, but it is my opinion that that has not been the case. The agriculturists have not got the benefit of the cheapest money that it was possible to get at the time. That is all the more in contrast with what goes on on the Continent, where in Denmark and some of the Scandinavian countries State credit is used to enable the peasants to purchase their holdings and carry on their operations with the aid of the cheapest money on the market at the time. The State usually has the advantage of borrowing relatively cheaply, and it is my firm conviction that, if the agricultural community has a right to assistance, it has a right to that kind of assistance to enable it to carry on its operations as cheaply as possible.<br><br>
The Act of 1928 was a charter to private banks, giving them a relative monopoly over agricultural credit and warning the State to keep off what was to them a private preserve which should not be interfered with. The interest rate of guilt edged stocks has fallen from 5 per cent. in 1932 before the big conversion to roughly a 3 per cent. basis to-day, and Government stock has been converted down to that level. But agri-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0600">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1207</span>
cultural mortgages have not. They are still at a very high level. I know of farmers who bought their land in 1920 and who are still paying 5 per cent. There has been no conversion to a lower rate as far as they are concerned. If State credit had been involved and the provisions of the Act of 1928 had not been in operation, if on the other hand State credit had been given, we should have had a very much better position. I wish to support the request that has been made from these benches for further information about this. What is the present rate of interest that is being paid on the old advances, what is being paid on new advances and, generally, what is the position? The subsidy of £60,000 to private interests which is here in this Clause should never have been necessary if agricultural credits had been handled properly from the beginning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Major Braithwaite</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am rather surprised that a Clause of this sort should have come into the Bill. It seems to me that the Minister ought to have made a clean sweep of all the old, stupid credit arrangements which have been applied by the Government to farmers in the past few years. The Bill is designed to make the farmers credit worthy. If it does not do that, it does not accomplish anything. If they become credit worthy, some new forms of credit at lower rates of interest are necessary. To prolong these ridiculous arrangements for another 19 years seems monstrous. I cannot imagine why they cannot clean the whole thing up at once. If it requires special legislation, a special Bill ought to be provided to enable them to pay off this money which was borrowed at a higher interest. As it is, it is a dead load round the neck of agriculture. It seems the obvious thing, if you are trying to make the industry sound, safe and reliable, and a real asset to the country, to get the credit position firmly established on a proper basis and, if you are going to give away £60,000 a year for 19 years, from which the farmer will not get a penny advantage, it is obviously wrong. However, I do not know what arrangements the Minister has been able to make. I do not propose to do anything but support him, because I do not know the full details of the scheme; but it seems to me that, if this is to be prolonged, he should take an early opportunity of coming to the House and getting

substantial financial aid for fanners, if he has established them as credit-worthy persons, so that this great industry can carry on with a measure of confidence which it has not enjoyed for a long time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Dorman-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Hillsborough (Mr. Alexander) was generous with regard to my Second Reading speech. He realised that there was a tremendous amount to cover and I am grateful to him for his remarks on that. This Clause does not represent any new departure in agricultural credit policy. What it represents is, I think, an important effort to overcome certain difficulties which have arisen in connection with the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation, which performed a very useful function at that time. The terms, as we thought of them then, were not so bad as they appear now. The right hon. Gentleman asked me who are the directors and what interests they represent. He asked whether it was composed entirely of bankers. They are not entirely bankers. There is Sir William Goschen, the chairman, and Mr. E. J. Bunbury, the deputy-chairman. They are bankers. There is Lord Clinton, who is agriculture, and William Gavin, who is agriculture, Sir George Barstow, who is the Government director, and Mr. Holland Martin and Mr. Phillimore, who are bankers. Therefore, there is a Government director and two representatives of agriculture on the Corporation.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman also asked with regard to the Whitehall Trust. It actually receives 100 guineas for acting as trustee. They do not get anything beyond that. They do not hold any debentures. When the right hon. Gentleman asked me who are the debenture holders, I cannot answer that, because they are the general public. Anyone can take up debentures.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the right hon. Gentleman answer as to what blocks are held by the bankers who are interested in the Corporation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Dorman-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Most of the banks, with the exception of the Midland. I have here a little paper recently issued which says the capital is held by the Bank of England, Barclays Bank, the District Bank, Glyn Mills and Company, Lloyds Bank, the Manchester and Counties Bank, Martins Bank, the

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1209</span>
National Provincial Bank, the Westminster Bank and Williams Deacon's Bank, Limited. They were called in to help to set up the corporation at the beginning. The history of the loans and the issues of debentures has already been told by the right hon. Gentleman. In 1929, £5,000,000 of 5 per cent. debentures at par were issued; in 1930, £3,500,000 worth of 5 per cent. debentures at par; and in 1932, £2,000,000 worth of 4½ per cent. debentures at 95. They were all issued. At the beginning there was not much difficulty in getting the public to take up the issue. The difficulty came when we had the conversion. That made lending a matter of exceeding difficulty for this Corporation. At the beginning they had lent at 5 per cent. There were no loans that I know of at 6 per cent., as the right hon. Gentleman suggested.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to be clear about this 5 per cent. business. I seem to have inklings of other figures than that, but I would not contradict the right hon. Gentleman. It does not seem to me a reasonable proposition that 5 per cent. was to be charged when 5 per cent. was to be paid to the lender.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Dorman-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. Five per cent. was the basic figure. Actually, the farmers were borrowing at 5½ per cent. and that covered interest, repayment of loans and administrative expenses. The corporation have to pay on their loans an average of 4·95 per cent., and they receive an average of 4·76 per cent. Therefore, in having to reduce their loans to try and meet the demand for money after the rates of interest have come down, the corporation find themselves in the position of losing money. I do not think this Clause can be said to be helping the bankers or anybody except the future borrowers, because there was under the 1929 Act a fund of £650,000 which was put at the disposal of the Mortgage Corporation at that time, for a very good reason, because Parliament wanted this corporation to start off right from the beginning as though it had been trading for some time and had kept a reserve fund. So Parliament gave to the Corporation £650,000, which could be used to secure the debenture interest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And it was free of interest?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1210</span>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Dorman-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Riley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But it is repayable?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Dorman-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It need not be called upon if the Corporation is in fact making a profit. The debenture holders are covered so far as that £650,000 goes. Therefore, if this Clause was not passed, it would not make any difference to the debenture holders for so long as the £650,000 did in fact last.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Less the £150,000 which has not been paid.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Dorman-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will come to that later. What would happen would be that if you got the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation going on its reserve fund, it would cease to be a gilt-edged security, and it would cease to be in a position to borrow new money freely, because it would be going downhill. That is one of the reasons why we put in this Clause, so that we can help the Corporation to carry on its business either by way of loan or by way of grant. If you had it merely by way of loan, it might be that when the Corporation came to the period when it would be in the market to borrow new money, perhaps at good rates, to redeem its present debentures and to help those who might borrow from it, it would have on its head a liability of a tremendous amount of money, and it would not in fact be able to redeem its debentures and borrow new money. One cannot possibly know what will happen in 20 years' time, what the interest rates will be, or anything else, and, therefore, it is suggested that this latitude should be allowed to the Government to say whether, on the facts of the situation, the Treasury will either lend the money or will in fact grant the money to the Corporation.<br><br>
It is proposed, and the intention is, that every three or five years the position will be renewed, and it will be decided by the Minister and by the Treasury whether it is appropriate that a loan should be granted or that a grant should be made to enable the Corporation to carry on. If the Committee will think, not in terms of what benefit this may give to bankers or the ordinary shareholders—because, as I submit, it gives no benefit whatsoever to them, as they are secured at the present moment—but if they will think in terms that perhaps in the future
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0602">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1211</span>
this machinery will be more useful than it is now, and the corporation may be in a position to borrow new money and lend it at a cheaper rate, then I think the Committee will agree that it will be of use to potential borrowers, and indeed to the present borrowers, to enable the corporation to be free of debt when it does in fact come to the end of its time and is able to redeem its present debentures.<br><br>
In regard to the position of those who borrowed before the rate of interest was reduced, the normal practice of the Corporation has been to allow those borrowers to convert their loans from the higher to the lower rate of interest. As I explained, the Corporation had to bring down its loans from 5½ per cent. At present it is 4¼, plus ½ for the sinking fund. They were allowed to convert their loans from the higher to the lower rate of interest on payment of a fee amounting to 5 per cent. on the outstanding balance of the loan, and the Corporation have given me their assurance that these facilities will be maintained without alteration, at least so long as the interest rates do not materially fall. One can see that if they materially fell in the near future, and then we had all this redemption, the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation might be in a parlous condition once again, but if things go on as they are at present, the same procedure will be allowed for all borrowers. In fact they will be allowed to redeem on the payment of the 5 per cent., and that, over a very short time, will in fact pay them to redeem their old mortgages and come on to the new rate. With just a repetition that this does not in fact represent any attempt at a new departure in agricultural policy, but is merely a method of enabling the present machine to function properly, I hope the Committee will be able to accept this Clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I asked what was the total amount out on mortgage at present. After all, there is a public subscription of £10,500,000. Is it all out? What is the charge arising each year in respect of which you want this grant?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Dorman-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The outstanding amount on loan is £6,252,246 in loans at 5 per cent., £1,990,251 in loans at 4¼ per cent. basic. There are also £28,422 in 5¼ per cent. Improvement
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1212</span>
Loans; that is to say, loans under the Improvement of Land Acts, and £59,820 in 4 per cent. Improvement Loans. The sinking fund on mortgage loans is 5s. 5^d. per cent. per annum on loans payable over 60 years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That leaves in round figures about £2,000,000 of subscribed debentures not actually used in agricultural lending, and I should like to know how they are dealt with.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Dorman-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They have to be invested in Government securities, and from the figures that I have here, there is invested £1,618,889, which yields 3·36 per cent., and it was borrowed at 4½ per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. J. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And it is that difference that this loan is to pay for?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Dorman-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is the whole difference.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Henderson Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would ask the Committee to consider a small Scottish point arising out of the Clause. On the Second Reading of the Bill the Secretary of State for Scotland referred to a recommendation that I had previously made to him that day by question. It was on 15th June, and the right hon. Gentleman reminded the House that there is in Scotland another body, the Scottish Agricultural Credit Corporation, which does the same kind of work but operates under a slightly different system. When you are going to ask Scottish taxpayers to meet their due proportion of this £60,000 per annum, they naturally ask why it is that the similar body operating in Scotland charges its borrowers more interest than does this body in England of its borrowers. The facts were stated by the Secretary of State on that day, and we have had them repeated this afternoon, that in England the interest charged upon loans made to farmers is 4¼ per cent., but that in Scotland it is 4½ per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Turton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has got it the wrong way round. It is 4¾ per cent. in England and 4½ per cent. in Scotland. You get the advantage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not adding repayment. The interest charged by the English corporation is 4¼ per cent., and the interest charged by the Scottish corporation is 4½ per cent. I asked my right hon. Friend on that occasion whether he
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0603">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1213</span>
would inquire of the Scottish corporation whether it could undertake to offer loans at the same rate as those offered in England. My right hon. Friend undertook to make representations to the Scottish corporation, and I have had no word since then what the result was. I only wish to obtain the assurance of the Under-Secretary of State that the Scottish corporation, which asks for no Government subsidy, should charge to its farmers no more than the English corporation, which is being subsidised to the extent of £60,000 per annum.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. J. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to remind the Committee of the origin of this concern. These three banks and their affiliated bodies definitely loaded this Corporation with liabilities which they did not want, and that was the purpose of the starting of this thing. They wanted to get rid of overdraft mortgages and so on that they were carrying, and this instrument was created, and they are now farming it in this way. The other point is this, that this company has impeded the proper treatment and the credit of farmers in the last few years, in a very difficult time for farmers. We have had it from the Minister this afternoon that it cannot operate except when money is dear, but it is when money is cheap that farmers are in the mind to develop and launch out, and then this body ceases to function, for all effective purposes. It is when money is dear that the farmer is short of finance, and so this is not an effective credit instrument for farmers, as we are buttressing this now again. I think that it will enable this corporation to get its affairs straight and now to draw upon its capital assets to pay interest charges, because that is what it has been doing and, therefore, it has not been able to function at the same time.<br><br>
Can we have an assurance that the Minister has this credit position for farmers well in mind? The industry is at the moment practically without an effective credit instrument of a substantial kind. This one has been standing in the way all these years. We are now strengthening it in such a way that it may still be half a job, but at the wrong time for the farmer. I would like to feel that the right hon. Gentleman will not allow this. I cannot believe that he has put this Clause in the Bill as a measure of agricultural reform. He has been invited to do it by persons who want to get the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1214</span>
matter straight; in other words, the Treasury has been asking somebody to do a piece of dirty work through an Agriculture Bill. We are grateful to the Minister for his excellent statement this afternoon on a very difficult position, but I do hope he can give us his assurance that he will not allow this business of this corporation to stand in his way when he really gets down to the job of dealing with agricultural credit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ridley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot refrain from saying what is in my mind about this Clause. Unpleasant though it may seem, as I see it I regard the Bill as becoming more and more unsavoury and unpleasant as we proceed from one Clause to another. Agricultural labourers may lose their jobs, agricultural workers may have their wages reduced, but bankers under no circumstances must lose J per cent. of their debenture interest—those martyred saints the 5 per cents.—and what has happened to-day is that the Minister has been kind enough to explain to us that in regard to a corporation the board of which is overwhelmingly within the control of banking interests, the Treasury is subscribing, within the provisions of this Clause, in order to maintain rates of interest which are now far above the market value of money. The Minister said that the position would be reviewed every three or five years; I should have liked him to have said that the position would be reviewed in terms of these interest rates, not every three or five years but in these terms. He explained that debentures raised at 4½ per cent., not being used for the purpose for which the Corporation was formed, were invested in Government stock with a yield of 3·63 per cent., or 1 per cent. less than the yield at which the debentures were raised. The purpose of this provision is to cover that difference.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Dorman-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That covers all the issues.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ridley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the purpose of this provision is to enable the debenture holder to maintain his 4½ per cent. and that money not being used for the purpose for which the Corporation was formed and being turned into a Government investment the difference between these two figures is to be bridged by the provisions of Clause 32. I regard that as an unhappy and unpleasant process. Indeed, the whole structure of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0604">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1215</span>
Corporation seems to need urgent reform, and there should be some substantial conversion operation. All these provisions are to enable the banking interest to maintain their rate of interest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. T. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope my friends will now see the wisdom of coming to a Division. I do not like the idea of casting a vote to deprive agriculturists of any reasonable facilities, but I am convinced that this corporation has not been very useful. I am equally convinced that this Clause will not provide agriculture with the credit facilities they are entitled to expect, and because I feel this is prolonging the agony I ask my hon. Friends to vote for the Amendment, and to remove the possibility of a grant and leave it by way of a loan. It will build up a load of debt and send the Corporation out of business, and the sooner the better. I hope my hon. Friends will vote for the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. H. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that before we vote the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland will reply to the point I raised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Wedderburn)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend is aware, the Scottish Agricultural Mortgage Corporation was not begun until 1934, several years later than the English one. At that time interest rates had fallen and the Scottish Corporation was able to borrow the money at a much lower rate than the English Corporation have borrowed it. The difference between them is not so much the rate of interest as the inability of the English Agricultural Mortgage Corporation to re-lend the very large sum of money which they had already raised in debentures,</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1216</span>
<p>and my right hon. Friend has explained that the grant in this Clause is being made, not to enable the English Corporation to reduce their rate of interest, but to make up the difference in charges between the surplus money which they cannot use and have invested in Government stock and the rate that they receive on their loans.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Riley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The rate they pay to the debenture holders.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wedderburn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Scottish Corporation never appears to have had any difficulty in getting rid of the money they raised in debentures. They have always charged a figure of 4½ per cent., and although that is slightly higher than the rate charged by the English Corporation, it is considerably lower than the charge which the English Corporation began at. So if you take all the borrowers together, the Scottish borrowers who have already borrowed and those who are just borrowing are paying a lower rate of interest. The Scottish Corporation are reluctant to make a distinction between the farmers who borrowed last year and the year before and those borrowing now. Their financial policy is a conservative one; they are paying off a certain amount of debt. I see that they put £4,673 into a special reserve for the redemption of the original loan of £100,000 from the Department of Agriculture. They do not require any State assistance and appear to have no difficulty in issuing loans at the rate of interest they have demanded.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. T. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order, in respect to the Amendment standing in the name of the hon. and gallant Member for Tiverton (Lieut.-Colonel Acland-Troyte) to define a "catch crop," has that point not been dealt with in Clause 3, Sub-section (I, <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>)? I do not see how a repetition of a similar argument can be made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will ask the hon. and gallant Member to introduce the subject and we will see if it does clash with what has been said already, although I do not think it does.</span></p>
<p>4.46 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel Acland-Troyte</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move in page 31, line 16, at the end, to insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"'catch crop' means an intermediate crop for forage or green manuring as usually taken between two of the main crops of a rotation."</p></blockquote>
In the Bill, the words "catch crop" are used, but without any definition, and I think it will be useful if some such reference as indicated in the Amendment is put in, because the phrase may be given different colloquial meanings in different parts of the country, as is the case with so many agricultural things. Therefore, I think it would be useful, although I notice that in Clause 27 (3) the Minister has power to lay down what catch crops are.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wedderburn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and gallant Friend seeks to define a catch crop as an intermediate crop for forage or for green manuring but, as a matter of fact, the crops that have been approved for sowing on newly ploughed grassland this summer have included some other crops which will be harvested, such as broccoli, turnips or mangolds, and I think the essential condition which we want is that the land should be brought into a state of cleanliness and fertility. Although the catch crop in the sense in which my hon. and gallant Friend seeks to define it might be perhaps the best way to do that, I do not think it is desirable to limit the use of the land to such crops. In a number of instances crops have already been approved which would not be covered by his definition, and the acceptance of the Amendment would render the land ineligible for the Government grant. I think my hon. and gallant Friend will
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1218</span>
also appreciate that, following the announcement of the 3rd May, some farmers have already sown crops which are not covered by his definition. I hope he will agree that it would be unfair to exclude them from the benefits of the proposed grant on that account.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel Acland-Troyte</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The last thing I want to do is to exclude any crop, but the crops which the hon. Gentleman mentioned are not catch crops, and therefore it seems to make it more important that a catch crop should be defined. However, I beg leave to withdraw the Amendment, since he said it would make no difference.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tom Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."<br><br>
In moving this Clause, which is also in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. J. Morgan), there are one or two things I want to say which may prevent some arguments being used.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0606">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1219</span>
Two years ago, on 7th July, a similar Clause was moved, but this Clause is slightly different from it, because the then Minister of Agriculture made a strong point that if that Clause were carried, as worded, it would put in a difficulty farmers who had sons working for them and not for wages in the ordinary way. Hon. Members will notice that this Clause deals with every adult person employed for wages on the farm, so that will obviate any hon. Member using the particular argument which was used by the Minister of Agriculture in 1937.<br><br>
There are one or two things that I anticipate will be said, upon which both sides of the Committee agree. In the first place, we all agree that agriculture is the first and most important industry there is. [HON. MEMBERS: "Agreed."] Well, I hope hon. Members will agree at the finish. A man can live longer without coal than he can without food, and it matters not how that food is served up, whether in the Ritz, or at Grosvenor House, or in the humblest cottage in the country—it has had to be produced. It has had to be produced by the farmer and the farm worker. The second thing which I am sure we shall all agree upon, is that we have in this United Kingdom some good agricultural land, and we produce possibly the best stock in the world, both with regard to quantity and quality. If anybody denies that, they need only look at the Show which took place at Windsor last week, or at any county agricultural show, and they will find there products of agriculture of which we can be proud. The next thing on which I am sure hon. Members will agree with me is that the agricultural worker is a skilled worker. The poverty of the agricultural worker has inspired artists to paint pictures. Those who have seen famous paintings depicting the agricultural worker carrying the burden on his shoulders know that the poverty and downtrodden condition of the workers have inspired artists to depict it on canvas.<br><br>
Although the agricultural worker is a skilled man he has never yet had a square deal from the angle of social conditions or decent wages. The hon. Member for Don Valley (Mr. T. Williams) and myself came into this House in 1922, straight from the pits, as miners' representatives,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1220</span>
from constituencies which were largely mining. We both spent our time working in the ground, and I think my hon. Friend will agree with me that the nearer one works to the land the less are the material possessions obtained. There is this striking similarity between working in a pit and working on a farm—it is not only skilled work, it is not only hard work, it is important work, and the conditions of both classes are far below what they ought to be. Because we and other hon. Members have been in this House for many years, we have found time to devote some of our attention to the position of the agricultural worker. We have in this House many hon. Members who speak on behalf of the landlords and who never fail to speak on behalf of the farmers, but there is no direct representative in this House of the agricultural worker. [HON. MEMBERS: "Yes."] Hon. Members opposite will have the chance later to refute the statements I make. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I hope the hon. and gallant Member opposite does not say he was a representative of the agricultural worker. When I fought him in 1922 and gave him the hiding of his life, he did not represent the agricultural worker, and he does not now. There is in this House no direct representative of the agricultural workers. I repeat that statement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir J. Lamb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What does the hon. Member mean by direct representation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will listen I will try and define it. There is no representative of a trade union catering for agricultural workers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Turton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very pleased hon. Members opposite are showing so much interest in this Clause, and I put two things to them. I want them to pay the same attention to this Clause as they pay to the agricultural worker at election time, when they flatter him and fawn on him to get his vote. I also want to put this to them. We have been talking this afternoon about providing tractors in case of war. The agricultural worker has been neglected by this Government, but if war broke out he would become very important, straight away. You would be on your knees almost begging him to produce more food. Therefore, I say we make no apology for moving this Clause.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0607">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1221</span>
The next thing, with which hon. Members will agree, is that £2 a week is not too much for working on the land. This Clause only puts £2 down as a minimum and not as a maximum. According to statistics the average wage that is paid to-day in the United Kingdom to the agricultural worker is about 34s. 9d. a week for, roughly, 51 or 52 hours.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>An Hon. Member</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does that include the value of perquisites?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a good deal of nonsense talked about the perquisites an agricultural workers gets. I have heard a good many hon. Members talk about giving the agricultural worker cheap milk, but to-day they cannot do it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Dorman-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes you can.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You can give it away, but you cannot sell it at a cheaper price. I went down to two counties during the last two week ends, and in Norfolk and Lincolnshire I was told the practice is not very general. If it be true that there are some perquisites for the agricultural worker, in addition to his wages, there are perquisites in other industries, such as home coal for miners. We must therefore argue on the money wages of 34s. a4. a week. One or two questions have to be answered. I am going to be perfectly frank and say that when meeting the employers one has to try and show that the industry can bear these proposals that are being put forward. This afternoon we are in difficulties, because we have been told repeatedly by the right hon. Gentleman that there are no reliable statistics in the Ministry of Agriculture with regard to the cost of production. Surely, hon. Members opposite are not denying that statement, which has been made repeatedly at Question Time and in this Committee. I have to rely on two things, information I dig up from publications, and Ministerial utterances; whether they are reliable or not, I have to rely upon them. Let us see the numbers employed in the industry, and from this angle we shall realise its importance. In 1921, 18 years ago, when we were talking about land settlement, when the men who were demobilised were beginning to come back, when you talked about putting men on the land under land settlement schemes, and so on, we had 996,081 persons em
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1222</span>
ployed in agriculture. To-day, we have 690,000. That is 300,000 fewer than we had 18 years ago; a decline that this Government and any other Government must pay attention to. Why have we had that decline? There are two main reasons for that decline. One is perhaps the minor one of mechanisation, but the other is on account of low wages, bad housing, and bad social conditions generally. We had a revolt of the farmers which caused this Bill to be brought in. We had the farmers in Norfolk threatening to put up candidates against the Government candidates. We had a revolt which has borne fruit in this Bill, and some relief from the Exchequer. I should like to see a revolt on the countryside. I should like to see the agricultural workers rise up in revolt against these bad conditions.<br><br>
When the Minister was speaking on the Second Reading of the Bill, he made a very broad survey of agriculture. I think he must have had a little touch of conscience, because when he talked about what the Government had done for the agricultural worker he dealt with three points which show how unequally the agricultural worker has been treated as compared with the ordinary industrial worker. I will take the right hon. Gentleman on his own statement. He mentioned, first of all, unemployment insurance as an indication of what the Government had done. Do hon. Members appreciate what they did under that Bill? From the angle of contribution they brought in a cheaper scheme, but they also brought in one that was cheaper from the point of view of benefits, and laid down something that has never been done in an Unemployment Insurance Act before—that the most any unemployed man could get in agriculture was 30s. a week, no matter how many children he had. Just at the time when the man needed the money to keep a big family, you denied it to him, on the grounds that if you give an unemployed man when he is out of work more than he gets when he is working, he would not find a job. You put that unfair penalty on him, and you have since raised it by 3s. If the right hon. Gentleman can get any comfort out of that Unemployment Insurance Act, I cannot. I should have liked to have seen the men treated more equally.<br><br>
The next thing the right hon. Gentleman quoted was holidays with pay. The Minister of Labour is the best "stone-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0608">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1223</span>
waller" any Government ever had, and he stood at the Box of the House and said that for the first time in the history of this country the farm worker was to have a holiday. He talked about him going to see the Exhibition at Glasgow, and going to the seaside. What did the Government do? They made the agricultural worker worse off than anybody engaged in industry. They said the agricultural worker might have six days' holiday with pay, but he must not go away for a week; he must have his holiday in two periods of three days each. Fancy the agricultural worker in Norfolk or Lincolnshire, or any other part of the country, coming home on a Saturday with half a week's wages in his pocket and saying to his wife: "Get the kids ready; I am taking you down to Skegness with about 17s. 6d." It just cannot be done.<br><br>
The next point was that wages had been dealt with by an Agricultural Wages Board Act passed in 1924, and that progress was being made. May I remind hon. Members opposite, that I spent about 11 days on that Bill in 1924, and when the Bill came out of Committee it was worse than when it went in, owing to a combination of Liberals and Tories. There are hon. Members in this House who were at that time hostile to that machinery. If the Committee want proof, I will give proof from Conservative publications which said they would rather rely on conciliation committees than upon an Act of Parliament.<br><br>
Hon. Members opposite are noted for their knowledge of history, I will tell them a little bit. During the War we had a Corn Production Act. Along with guaranteed prices we had an Agricultural Wages Board. At no time during the War, when the £ was worth about 7s., did the agricultural workers' wages in this country reach 50s. They were generally 46s. 6d. When war was over, and that glorious period of reconstruction came, when you swept the country in 1918 and told the lads who fought what you would do for them, after four years of Coalition, you betrayed agriculture and the farmers. You decontrolled corn production although the Act itself said there was to be five years' notice given to the farmers. How many farmers did you ruin who had bought farms at enhanced prices? You abolished the wages boards
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1224</span>
and fixed up your conciliation committees. You had Noel Buxton in 1924 admitting in the House that there were wages in certain districts of this country, under conciliation committees, of less than £1 a week. There are hon. Gentlemen opposite who did not like that Bill, who weakened it in Committee, but preferred to leave the unorganised agricultural worker to the tender mercies of the farmer. We put that Act on the Statute Book in spite of opposition, and it has been a good thing. The right hon. Gentleman will tell us that is the machinery for regulating it.<br><br>
I put this suggestion to the Minister, knowing that in his heart he agrees that £2 a week minimum in this Clause is not high enough for the agricultural worker—I should think a lot less of him if be believed £2 a week was enough. I will do him the credit of saying he hopes, as a result of these measures, that the agricultural wages boards will increase wages. Whatever the fate of this new Clause, as Minister for Agriculture, he ought to say definitely to all county agricultural wages boards that he expects, as Minister for Agriculture, that a fair proportion of this prosperity that is being given to the industry shall find its way, in the shape of wages, into the pockets of those who produce the goods. Will the right hon. Gentleman make that statement to encourage all county representatives? Of course, he will not. Therefore, I say it needs something more than the Agricultural Wages Board Act; it needs Parliament to say what shall be the minimum wage.<br><br>
The first time I came into this House was in 1912 to hear the Miners' Minimum Wage Bill being debated. I little thought then that 10 years later I should be in as a Member. We were told then that it was impracticable, but it was one of the finest things ever put on the Statute Book. It did not make the minimum wage the maximum; it simply gave a bedrock figure below which wages should not fall. We have to answer this question to-day: can the agricultural industry afford it? According to the official figures, the total produce of the farms of this country being sold amounts to about £250,000,000 a year. I do not think the right hon. Gentleman will deny that statement. That is the price paid at the farm for the produce. It is the Minister of Agriculture's statement. There are employed in agriculture 600,000 workers. If we take
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0609">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1225</span>
90,000 off that, and assume a figure of 600,000 in the industry, working for wages, and assume for each an average of £100 yearly, we get a wages' Bill of £60,000,000. Sixty millions from £250,000,000 leaves £190,000,000. I do not know how much of that goes in rent, or how much the landlord takes out of it. I have heard it put at £47,000,000, but I do not know, neither do I know the total amount paid for raw materials, fertilisers and things of that kind. I know it is sold for more than £250,000,000 to the retailer. It must be nearly double that figure.<br><br>
If the Government were really sincere in their desire to put agriculture on a proper footing and to give the workers a square deal, they would have accepted proposals put forward by us for a commission to go into the question of where the difference of price goes between the producing end and the consuming end, and what proportion the middleman gets out of it. If we eliminated a good deal of the cost of distribution we should be able to give the farmer a better price and the farm worker a better wage. I heard a good story which illustrates this point about middlemen. I see that the hon. Member for Thirsk and Malton (Mr. Turton) is laughing. I usually laugh after trie story.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Turton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was laughing because I was watching the Chair watching the hon. Member, and I was also hoping to get the story.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: An agricultural worker told me the story on Saturday night. He said that a man in his village came running out of his house saying: "My wife's seriously ill. Fetch the undertaker." Somebody said to him: "You want the doctor, not the undertaker," but the fellow said: "No I don't. I'm going to cut out the middleman, straight away."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir W. Womersley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have heard it told better about Yorkshire.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can tell it better than that. I believe there are sufficient resources in the industry to pay the cost, but we have not any statistics. I suppose most hon. Members read "The Countryman." It is a half-crown publication. You will see it on the bookstalls. In the one I have, it asks the question: How many farmers made £2,000 a year? The estimates that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1226</span>
are given vary from 30 to 2,000 in the country. One man says that many farmers are getting a good living, which is what matters. Another says:
<br><blockquote><p>"I am certain there are far more farmers making a satisfactory living from their farms than the public imagine."</p></blockquote>
Another tells of a farm which lost money in 1935–36, made £14,000 profit in 1938–39, and this year will make another substantial figure. One farmer is reported by an expert as saying that if a man had a bit of capital it did not take much brains to make £1,000 a year at farming. I recommend "The Countryman" to hon. Members. It is not a Socialist publication. You find it in country houses. Hon. Members must ask themselves what assistance is to be given to the industry, both direct and indirect, out of a wages bill of £60,000,000. Hon. Members will be very interested in another publication. It happens to be by one who compiled the booklet called "Agricultural Policy, Past, Present and Future." In it he says:
<br><blockquote><p>"During the period under review, more outstanding legislation in respect of agriculture has been passed than in any comparable period. In fact, we might go further and say that the agricultural legislation of this period was more important than all the agricultural legislation since the repeal of the Corn Laws."</p></blockquote>
How much assistance does the industry get, direct and indirect? First of all, it is relieved of rates. The relief used to be a quarter and then it became a half. Now the industry is relieved altogether. Then you have the Wheat Act. Then there are subsidies, tariffs, quotas and all kinds of things, until it is estimated that, directly and indirectly, assistance is being given to agriculture to-day in the region of £40,000,000 or £45,000,000; in other words, at least two-thirds of the total wages bill, as we can calculate by the documents which are at our disposal. Still we are told that it cannot be done.<br><br>
I have no hostility to the farmers. I know a good many of them. I know their mannerisms and customs, how they can lose money, how they can make money, and how they can tell the tale. Remember that we are living in times that are very much changed compared with 20 years ago. Nobody knows what is to happen in the next two or three years. Even the Conservative party have done during the last two or three years what 10 years ago would not have been believed by the ordinary Conservative.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0610">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1227</span>
At one time hon. Members used to believe in private ownership and that if an industry could not stand on its own feet it ought to go out of existence. I could quote from Lord Baldwin the very statement he made. He used to believe that Socialism was bad and that State action was no good. I have seen hon. Members all make public ownership for the petroleum found in the country and of the mineral wealth, in a way absolutely contrary to Conservative party policy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. J. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And tithes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What you are doing to-day is subsidising agriculture in every way you can think of. We are told that this Bill is only an instalment. You have never yet made an effort as a Government to give the agricultural worker a portion of it. I look through the list of wages in every district of the country. It shows that where the workers are badly organised wages are low and that where wages are comparatively high is where the workers are well organised. Can any opponent of the proposed new Clause tell me where, in the last seven years, any farmer's representative on a county agricultural wages board has, of his own volition, advocated a higher wage for his workers? The appointed members, yes, but the farmers, no.<br><br>
There will be a General Election sooner or later, and some hon. Members must in their hearts feel a little perturbed. You have dipped your hands into the Exchequer and you are doing nothing to give to the agricultural workers a square deal. I ask hon. Members to have courage and to be big enough to say that £2 per week shall be paid if this subsidy is paid.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Ernest Shepperson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In my own county the farmers' representative on the agricultural wages board proposed a rise in the wages owing to the assistance that had been given.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would be the first to say, "Thank you," and to the hon. Member: "Go back and do likewise. You have a long way to go." If the proposed new Clause were carried it would operate only on farms where the subsidy was payable. You can separate these farms one from another. There would be very few farms which would receive subsidy for the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1228</span>
first time. Most farms will be receiving subsidy in one form or another.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Snadden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Only in certain circumstances. You get a subsidy only when the market crashes. We are not going to make millions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I quite appreciate the point. There are few occasions in this House when the position of the agricultural labourer can be discussed, and we have to take advantage of Bills like this. We have to thrash this matter out. I regard it as wrong that the Exchequer should go on pouring out millions of pounds in one way and another without seeing to it that the farm worker gets a square deal. Hon. Members have to be big enough to admit that the farm workers are not getting enough, and not make the pessimistic sort of statement of the Minister the other day when he said that he never recalled that agriculture had been prosperous. I had asked the Minister to tell us when last the industry was prosperous and he replied in the way I have described.<br><br>
I do not for one moment believe that the industry is as bad as hon. Members make it out. I go further and say that if certain farmers went on their knees before me to say that they were losing as much money as they tell the Minister they are, I would not believe them, because I know different. I move the proposed new Clause because I recognise that the agricultural workers are an important factor in our industrial life. We recognise that they have never yet had a square deal, but have had low wages, bad housing and insanitary conditions, which have been driving the men away. If the Committee accept the Clause saying that no subsidy should be paid unless the workers are getting at least £2 per week, whatever difficulties were in the way would pretty soon be put right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Henderson Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the last hon. Member who spoke admitted, there are obvious difficulties about the form of this Amendment. It is restricted to the farmers who are to receive subsidy under the Act. There are many reasons why it would not be regarded as sound, but I have the greatest sympathy with the views which inspired the hon. Member to put it forward, and I feel disposed to support it. The drain of agricultural
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0611">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1229</span>
workers from the land is becoming almost terrifying. The number since 1921 in England, Wales and Scotland exceeds 300,000. I recently worked it out with some farmers, and it is clear that if this rate continued there would not be, in Scotland at least, any farming of the land at all.<br><br>
Parliament cannot possibly face this situation without grievous alarm and without attempting to do something. The hon. Member for Leominster (Sir E. Shepperson) said that the farmers in his district had supported an increase in wages. I was glad to hear it. The Scottish National Farmers' Union representatives were here a few days ago and I was authorised by them to say that they desired to increase the wages in Scotland by at least 5s. per week now. The only condition they would make was that they were to be satisfied that out of the Bill such returns would come to them as to make that possible. There is no dispute among those engaged in agriculture as to the desirability of and the case for an increase in wages. Nobody questions that the workers deserve it and nobody denies that their housing conditions are in many cases deplorable. In Fife, which is a comparatively prosperous part of the agriculture in Scotland, some of the conditions are scandalous, and to an increasingly alarming extent young men are going away.<br><br>
What can we do in these circumstances? I know that throughout the discussions on the Bill the Labour party have contended that there is no need for these special measures. It is difficult to understand that point of view. During the depression, for four or five years, farmers were selling their goods, the same kind of goods and of the same high quality—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. T. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the hon. Gentleman is entitled to make that statement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. H. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have not completed it yet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member said that throughout the various stages of the Bill we had said there was no need for it. We had never said any such thing. What we have said is that we could perhaps justify subsidies if proper conditions were laid down. What I say is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1230</span>
that subsidies are being provided without any conditions at all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. H. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That may have been the argument produced by the hon. Member, but the right hon. Member for Hillsborough (Mr. Alexander) did not use that argument. On the Second Reading and on the opening day of this Committee he said that there was no need for these subsidies. He said farmers were making huge profits; that during the years of depression farmers continued to supply things that left no return to them at all, and as a result of that farm workers were receiving wages shillings a week less than they ought to. I have pleaded for an increase in farm workers' wages; I ask for that increase now. In fact in Scotland the good farmers are paying more than two pounds a week, and I am not opposed to laying down as in minimum two pounds a week. While I feel that this Clause, as drafted, is not a sound Amendment, the sentiments are such that I cannot reject the new Clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. J. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise to support the proposed new Clause. I started at 22s. a week on the land and lived with a horseman and his wife at 7s. 6d. a week. Twenty-two shillings were my only means of subsistence, and from that moment I have never ceased to believe that agriculture cannot be regarded as soundly based unless it can pay its workers a wage equivalent to that of other skilled workers. I want to suggest to the Minister that he is within an arm's length of the possibility of that. It is true we have 690,000 men in the industry, but 34s. 6d. is the ascertained average wage as laid down by county agricultural wages committees, but he has said on several occasions that in fact farmers are paying more wages than that. If you take it at 34s. 6d., 5s. 6d. is required to lift it to 40s. There are, roughly, 600,000 adult workers involved. That would mean about £8,000,000 a year, but in fact the wages are probably 4s. on an average better than that, so the sum could be put down for £4,000,000, What is the principle in our Clause? That no farmer undertakes to pay these wages unless it is worth his while. If he takes the subsidy he understands that he has to pay a minimum wage, and he will not take the subsidy unless it is worth his while. If it is not worth his while to take the subsidy, he need not accept.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0612">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1231</span>
<p><span class='member'>Sir J. Lamb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Member said that they are paying more, did he mean for the shorter hours or more for the longer hours and overtime?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that even taking into account horsemen's wages and cowmen and so on, 37s. 6d. and 46s. for the extra hours of work, even where the minimum wage is paid for the standard week, there are in fact a very large number of farmers who are paying more than the county wage. But we can rule out the carters and the cowmen, because we have left this suggestion of ours open. We have no fixed hours in it. We have been content to get the principle of £2 a week based entirely upon the wage and hours as defined by a county wage committee. There is an advantage in this. The Minister is wanting a whole-hearted support for his proposals from the industry. We should be throwing away a political advantage if we were discussing politics. Imagine the interest of a farm worker if his employer goes in for ploughing up his land, reconditioning his land, for drainage grants, and grows the crops eligible for subsidy, and he is himself involved in the transaction. You are going to get a certain number of farm workers interested in that operation, and industry will be behind the Government's policy.<br><br>
I should like to suggest that we have been discussing this Bill not from the point of view of the subsidies but purely as to whether we are going to get value for money. If the State can show that when we are going to provide for the farmer it would give a net economic return to the State there would be no argument. Here we are, in the industry, facing a moment when we have to supplement the labour force by recruiting women, by recruiting through Employment Exchanges, putting back on the land men from distressed areas, who will give part-time work, we are having to shut our eyes to the fact that we are letting more Irish labour get on to the farms. Can we refuse £4,000,000 for which we should get full value for money? If from this time on the minimum wage would be £2 a week it would have an electrifying effect on the industry. It would not be only the cash advantage but the status at last given to the farm workers, showing that we recognise it in Parliament and that we are doing something to meet this position.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1232</span>
I want to make this last point for hon. Members and right hon. Gentlemen in this Committee and in the House of Commons, that if only the farm workers would get inside their trade unions, this £2 a week would have to be paid straight away. You are in fact taking a mean advantage of the fact that they are not organised. If you deny them this £2, you know they are not in a position to demand it and you want their labour. You are just hoping that, incidentally, there may trickle to them through the cracks of these Bills some additions to their wages, but as to lifting their wages as an act of good will by a substantive Act of Parliament, no. You are diddling them for a few shillings a week, knowing that in time you will have to give them £2 a week and raise the farm workers' status. You are going to have nondescript workers on your farms. You are going to pay subsidies but you are not taking steps to meet the greatest problem, the decline in the quantity and quality of the labour, and the drift of labour from the country. All for a mere £4,000,000 you are neglecting to put in this provision.<br><br>
The political advantage would be yours if you did this act of justice. You stole it in agricultural insurance. You can steal it now, if this National Government announced it was going to give the farm workers two pounds a week, following on this subsidy scheme. We should then lose a large measure of our appeal. The condition of the farm worker is such on the economic side and in status that he is leaving the farms. He knows his industry to be a good one, but if he goes on the road he has a stamp on the card with more quality and value on it than on the agricultural card. All this pretence of sympathy and recognition of the agricultural labour on the part of the right hon. Gentleman means that he can see the difficulty of supporting us. No farmer will pay this unless he gets some advantage from a subsidy. We ask him to put in a provision for increased wages and I do hope he will take courage. You will want to offer two pounds presently.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Major Braithwaite</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. T. Smith) will forgive me if I remind him that I have represented farm labourers for many years in this House.</span></p>

him to say there was no direct representation of the organised workers, and I did not look on the hon. and gallant Member as representing the agricultural labourer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Major Braithwaite</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have tried to do everything possible to improve the position of the agricultural labourer in my constituency, and if the hon. Member cares to come with me I could point to many substantial improvements in their housing, in their conditions, in their status. I am in complete sympathy with the object of this new Clause, and I wish it were possible to put something of this kind into an Act, but I am afraid it is going to defeat its own purpose. There is a medium for the regulation of wages, just as there is a medium in the coal mining industry, but that did not come into the Bills regulating the operations of the coal industry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. T. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As a matter of fact, the Miners (Minimum Wage) Bill of 1912 does contain a certain minimum. The Agricultural Wages Board lays down a minimum.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Major Braithwaite</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You did not put that into a Bill such as the Bill dealing with coal-mining royalties. I am prepared to support the hon. Gentleman in bringing forward a Bill and helping it if it would give a better agricultural wage. Why limit it to £2? Why is not the agricultural labourer entitled to just as much as the coal miner? There is no denned maximum to which one can go. Here, however, we are making a genuine attempt to raise the status of the industry so that it can pay better wages, and there will be no excuse for any Agricultural Wages Board, on which labour is adequately represented, not putting forward a strong plea that action be taken for an advance in wages in most of the districts in the country. I hope that the Agricultural Wages Boards will take advantage of this and bring it forward, but there is the machinery and we cannot put into an Act of Parliament of this sort, dealing with so many commodities, something entirely different from the main purpose of the Bill.<br><br>
I regard this Bill as one of the best agricultural Measures that has ever been presented to Parliament; it gives us a chance, for the first time, to stabilise the prices of commodities and thus make it possible for farmers to produce, at a profit, essential commodities that go with
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1234</span>
the crop rotations of our country. If they can do that, I can assure hon. Members in all parts of the House that there is no section of the community more desirous than the farmers of the country of seeing their labour raised to the status of every other industry we have. The farmers are just as zealous of their own labour as any other section of employers and I am quite sure that given reasonable opportunities—which they have not had, and I blame the National Government very largely for the state which agriculture has got into in the past few years—you will find more quickly than anything else that the position of the agricultural labourer will rise, his wages will improve, and you will have men wanting to go back to the land again. I entirely agree with the whole of the sentiments expressed by my hon. Friend, and the only reason I cannot support him in a Division is because I do not feel this is the right Bill for it to go in. If I could see any advantage in putting it into this Bill, I would support him now, but I believe it is going to jeopardise the existing machinery if we try to bring it into the present Clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Dorman-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure the Committee will agree with the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. T. Smith) that we have no qualms about this most important question. All sides of the Committee welcome the discussion on this question of the condition of the farm worker. I know that the party opposite will give us the credit for sincerity when we say that we all agree with the purpose which is behind this proposed Clause.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Normanton has worked for a very long time for the farm workers of this country, and there are many of us who also think that we have been working on behalf of the farm workers, although in perhaps a different way. We have been trying for a very long time to raise the wage-earning capacity of the industry of agriculture. I shall never be content until our land workers do in fact enjoy equality of wages and equality of conditions of work with similar workers in urban industry. For years that has been part and parcel of my creed, because it is absolutely crystal clear that you never will have a proper agricultural policy unless you have workers content to stay on the land and work on the land.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0614">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1235</span>
It is, however, an extremely difficult thing to put such a Clause as is suggested in a Bill like this, and it is impossible for the Government to accept the Clause. It is not because we do not realise the importance of the question. There are many of us here who, too, have enjoyed the friendship of the land worker. Many of us have lived very close to him and learnt to respect him. We have known all his aspirations and difficulties, and have given credit to him for the skill which he displays in his work. This Bill in itself cannot possibly bring prosperity to agriculture. It deals only with one or two facets of the whole problem, but we do hope that by taking all our measures together the time will come when not only the farm worker will take his proper place in our economic life, but also the farmer. Judging from the letters I have had from thousands of small farmers one must admit that they are in a depressed industry—not, of course, the large farmers—but I am perfectly certain that these small men who live a peasant life do feel they are not of great importance. To me agriculture is entirely indivisible. You have got all the people connected with it, and you cannot just separate them; they are all part of a very great thing. If I am right in my hopes that the policy that we have been putting forward will in fact bring about the desired degree of prosperity and the right wage-earning capacity of the industry, then the hon. Member for Normanton will agree with me that the actual machinery of the Agricultural Wages Act does function properly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. T. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to put one point. It works fairly well, but it does not work as it ought to. When the Bill was first introduced the Central Committee had the power on award to send it back if they were satisfied the award was not fair. I should like to see something of that kind put in the present Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Dorman-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that point, but there are various measures which do affect different districts in different ways. That is agreed. If there is one district which does benefit—an arable district, or whatever it may be—it reacts pretty quickly through the country. One knows what the opposition to an agricul-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1236</span>
tural wages board is, and I think there is a lot to be said for that particular opposition. I believe that the best way to deal with this question is to deal with the local conditions and see if in fact it has gone through in one part of the country and not in others, and that one part of the country under present conditions can take advantage, whereas if one had to take a standard wage throughout the country, there would not be some justification for that district.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. J. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Then the Minister is not in favour of a statutory minimum wage for the agricultural worker?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Dorman-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You can make that point if you want.. A statutory minimum wage throughout the country under all conditions might be very difficult indeed to achieve straight away.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. J. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no difference between that and price insurance for sheep, oats and barley. You put a bottom to their market. Why not put a bottom to the farm workers' wages?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Dorman-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because it depends upon the ability of agriculture to pay in the various districts. No one can suggest that you can entirely isolate wages from the paying capacity of the industry. Surely, the first approach must be to try by proper co-operation and proper means to get that industry into a position to pay those wages. I entirely agree with what the hon. Member said with regard to the importance of the agricultural worker in war-time, and so on, but I am not entirely convinced that wages are the only factor in the land worker's life and troubles. There are questions of amenities, housing and all those other things. I beg leave to doubt if you did put your wages up to £2 a week at this moment, whether that would have the effect automatically of stopping the drift from the land that is going on now, because, unfortunately, the urban districts and industries can and do always afford to offer more in wages than agriculture is able to pay. That happens in every country throughout the world. It is the same problem. What we want to try and do is to make the whole life attractive to the men so that they will not be drawn away by a temporary gain which they probably know is temporary—building camps and so on. One wants to make it a permanent

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1237</span>
way of life. That I say in all sincerity is just as much our desire as it is the desire of hon. Members opposite.<br><br>
When one comes to the actual proposal in the new Clause, I am sure it will be seen that it is quite impracticable, dealing with this Bill, because you would have two quite extraordinary anomalies. First, you might have the case of the farmer who is in arable farmer who would be compelled to pay 40s. a week, by taking these very subsidies mentioned here. On the other hand, you would have a man purely in dairying or fat cattle raising with a grass farm, who might be paying very much more.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Those are the very districts that are paying higher wages now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Dorman-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There would be the differentiation. You would have this anomaly. You would have another extraordinary anomaly which I do not think is meant, and that would be that when you get to the level of these subsidies the farmer would most definitely be making a loss on the commodity which he is producing. The Exchequer subsidy on barley, the subsidy on sheep, and the subsidy on oats will not represent a profit to the farmer. While he is taking the subsidy, when he is making a loss, he would then be compelled to pay 40s. a week. If prices rose above the subsidy levels, he then would not be compelled to pay 40s. a week. Under this new Clause he would have to go back to the Agricultural Wages Act. I am perfectly certain the hon. Member will see that this is rather a queer position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Might I ask two questions on that? I want to deduce what the Minister's argument is. In the first place, is it his argument that, whilst you can afford many millions a year for a subsidy for price insurance for commodities, you cannot afford any more for wages? That is the first point. Secondly, does the right hon. Gentleman hold it would be wrong to have a position in which a minimum wage was tied to a subsidy period, because otherwise they would afterwards be forced back upon the Agricultural Wages Board? Does it not immediately appeal to the Minister that if they had been able to get the wage under the other conditions, then the trade union will look after them under the Agricultural Wages Board.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1238</span>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Dorman-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman was out of the Committee during part of the Debate. There are some places where the trade unions cannot do if because they are not properly organised. I commend to agricultural workers that they should become organised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What about the money?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Dorman-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What money:
Mr. Alexander: You say you can afford it for commodities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Dorman-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With regard to the price levels that we are striving for, what we are saying to the farmers is this: when you are definitely making a loss on one or other of these commodities, and selling your goods below the cost of production, we will not allow those prices to come in lower than a certain level. But we are not trying or attempting to guarantee a profit. We cannot do that. Therefore, you are coming to a price insurance level which does not in fact represent a profit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would point out that in 1923 the present Minister of Health said there was no money for subsidies. In 1926 the Baldwin Administration's White Paper on Agriculture said the policy of subsidies was absolutely unworkable and not to be desired at all. The Government have come to the policy for a subsidy for price insurance and I venture to suggest that you will have to come to proper treatment of the worker as well.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Dorman-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are trying to do things which we consider vital for the future of the agricultural workers of this country and vital for the success of agriculture itself. While I have said the subsidies which we are giving to price insurance are not meant to create a profit, one hopes that the exercise of the whole policy, the proper regulation of imports and the like, will get the industry into a condition where it will make a profit. I could not ask the Committee to accept this new Clause because of the anomalies which in fact it would bring about in this Bill, but I do sincerely hope that nobody will think our desire to see the agricultural worker in his proper place is any less than that of Members on the other side.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. T. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be no use saying I am sorry about the Minister's
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0616">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1239</span>
reply, because I anticipated the reply would be in those terms. First of all, we have no argument against certain administrative difficulties that would follow the acceptance of this Clause. We have no arguments against the submission that this Clause would create certain anomalies, but not greater anomalies than a level subsidy for any commodity whether the yield is 11 cwt. or 20 cwt., whether the land is good and fertile, whether the land is heavy clay or light sandy soil, or whatever it may be. You give a subsidy for beef of £5,000,000 per annum. You do not say that because certain land is better pasture land than other land, Northumberland for instance, that you will give a smaller subsidy in Northumberland than to a beef producer in Essex or somewhere else. I am willing to concede that this particular Clause would create momentary anomalies, but not nearly so big as the anomalies we create already by some of the level subsidies that have been granted since 1931.<br><br>
We expected from the Minister and from hon. Members opposite expressions of sympathy towards agricultural labourers. It is not the first time that I have heard those expressions of sympathy. Sometimes I regard them as really sincere, and on other occasions as being less than sincere. I was in the Committee in 1924 when the Agricultural Wages Regulation Bill was before it. I happened to be Parliamentary Private Secretary to the then Minister of Agriculture, and I happen to know that the Minister was warned that unless he got rid of the National Wages Board the Bill was as good as dead. I can tell this Parliamentary secret now. It was my job to be moving round the lobbies to collect the voices of the people, and having collected them I knew there would be no Bill if there was to be a National Wages Board. In the same Committee, Conservative Members were sympathetic, as they are this afternoon, but expressions of sympathy do not go very far with me.<br><br>
There have been subsidies for sugar, beef and so on, and sympathy has always been expressed for the labourers, but the money has never been there. As the hon. Member for Stone (Sir J. Lamb) would put it, no doubt, this is not the proper Bill or the proper time. In any other set of circumstances than those of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1240</span>
moment, we might consider that, but not now. I concede that there have been periods of distress for some farmers, but I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Mr. T. Smith) that there are farmers to-day who are making very big profits. A few weeks ago, the Minister and I were at Broadcasting House when one farmer told the country that he was doing very well out of farming and that other farmers could do likewise if they specialised, as apparently he was doing. I do not suggest that every farmer in the country is prosperous, for I know there are variations and anomalies, good farmers and less good farmers—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir J. Lamb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Member recognise that if every farmer specialised, it would become a generalisation, and the farmers would not get the advantage?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Exactly. There is not specialisation in a comprehensive sense, but the hon. Gentleman will tell us that there will be anomalies if we accept the new Clause. I agree with the Minister that it is time there was a sense of equality between the agricultural labourer, who is equally skilled, and the artisan in the town. A few weeks ago, I received a letter from a very important person in Scotland, who is highly placed on one of the most important committees ever set up by the Ministry of Agriculture. He had worked out a balance-sheet in detail, and had shown—and I have had this tested by farmers—that a farmer on a reasonably good mixed farm of 500 acres could, at the moment, and certainly when this Bill is passed, collect £2,000 per annum in various subsidies. I was talking earlier of a good mixed farm employing about three employes per hundred acres. Therefore, if a farmer employed 15 hands on a 500 acres farm, and had to pay an increase in wages of 5s. a week—£13 for each—he would have to pay an extra £195 a year in wages. But if he could collect £2,000 per annum in subsidies, he could afford that. What has happened since 1926? In 1926, the average wage was 31s. 8d. In June, 1939, despite all the subsidies and expressions of sympathy, the average wage is 35s. 3d., so that during the past 13 years wages have increased at the rate of 3¼d. a year.<br><br>
Some hon. Members wonder why we cannot keep agricultural labourers on the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0617">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1241</span>
land. Wages of that sort will not keep the best young men on the land, preserve the skill of the countryside, and help us to maintain a healthy rural population. We shall need to do something more than that. I have been trying to work out the whole of the figures in order to ascertain exactly how the division of spoils has taken place during the several years in which subsidies have been paid. I count approximately 380,000 men as being permanently engaged in the industry, as well as about 180,000 boys, women and casuals, divided as to 90,000 boys, 40,000 females and 50,000 more or less full-time casuals. In the case of the 380,000 men, the wages have increased by 3s. 7d. per week and in the case of the boys, females and casuals, by 2s. 6d. per week, so that this increase will call for approximately £4,750,000 per annum more in 1939 than in 1926. During that time, we have granted, directly and indirectly, financial subsidies to the extent of about £27,500,000 per annum, and if we think in terms of rates remission, it is anywhere up to £40,000,000 or so. Therefore, the agricultural labourers have not got their fair share.<br><br>
If the right hon. Gentleman accepted the new Clause, it would create immediate anomalies, but we should immediately follow it up with a similar Amendment of the Milk Bill, which grants another £2,500,000 to agriculture, and if some farmers were paying skilled labourers better wages than others, they would keep their workers and collect workers from other counties, so that very soon the other counties would have to come up to the standards brought about as a result of this Measure. Apart altogether from subsidies over a period of time, the Government have assisted research. Research has enabled the farmers, by using such information and science as was put at their disposal, to increase the productivity per person employed by about 30 per cent. since 1930. Therefore, although slightly more wages are paid to the individual, the productivity which he gives to the farmers is far in excess of the few shillings per week extra which he now receives in wages. To ask for a minimum of £2 where subsidies are being paid is not asking for a great deal.<br><br>
If the Minister is unable to accept the Clause, I think it is his duty to try to find an alternative means of establishing
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1242</span>
that wage and of helping the farmers to keep such skilled workers as they may have on the farm. I hope the hon. and gallant Member for Buckrose (Major Braithwaite), who has expressed sympathy on many occasions, will vote with us this evening and help us to compel the Department to find the appropriate words and machinery. Whatever administrative problem may confront the Department, if it is a case of giving and distributing money, they will set up a committee and produce the machine. If the words of the new Clause are not the right ones, and if this Committee found difficulties and laid the responsibility on the Department and the Government, they would find the ways and means. If the right hon. Gentleman turns down the new Clause, then we can only say that in this Bill it is a question purely of money exclusively designed to help the farmers and the landowners as distinct from agriculture, and that it is not giving the labourers of the industry a square deal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise with diffidence after hearing the Minister's statement, but I have real sympathy with the new Clause. I do not wish to make any debating points, and I regret that there has been so much heat on a simple and direct proposal of this kind. The clear fact is that by this new Clause we are asked to say that no farm labourer shall receive less than 40s. a week. [HON. MEMBERS: "No."] It says that no farm labourer shall receive less than 40s. a week on the farms with which the Bill deals. That is a start. If it gives an opportunity of making a start and setting an example, it seems to me that the new Clause is proposed in the right place. I have no farm labourers' votes to catch in my Division, but I could not say to a working-class audience that I was against farm labourers receiving £2 a week. Sitting next to me is my hon. Friend the Member for Evesham (Mr. De la Bere) who so fittingly represents the peaceful and lovely vale of Evesham. I am wondering what he will say when he goes to Evesham and tells them that he has been in a Committee here and that the Committee tells him that farm workers are not worth £2 a week. If we are to give a subsidy, let us see whether we cannot take a step forward in another direction and give the farm labourer better wages. This Bill is a Bill to restore
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0618">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1243</span>
agriculture, once the country's pride, and I think the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. T. Smith) has moved a new Clause that cannot be denied. If necessary, I shall support the new Clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Price</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think there is general agreement among most hon. Members that something ought to be done in this matter, but there is a certain amount of doubt about the method of doing it. I feel very strongly that if we are to have standard prices fixed for a number of agricultural products, we ought also to have standard wages. That is what is proposed in the new Clause. The hon. and gallant Member for Buckrose said that the new Clause attempts to treat agriculture differently from coal-mining. He said that in the case of coal-mining, the wages are fixed locally by wages committees; and therefore, why should we not have the same thing for agriculture. He said that any attempt to introduce a central organisation is undesirable. I would remind the hon. Member that agricultural workers are not organised as the miners are, and that some sort of legislation is necessary to deal with their case. It was for that reason that, when the Bill dealing with Agricultural Wages Boards was introduced, my hon. Friends moved an Amendment that there should be a Central Wages Board. That was not agreed to. Therefore, we have to fall back upon this sort of provision.<br><br>
At the present time, many agricultural products are guaranteed a decent market. There are fixed prices for sugar beet. Milk comes under the Milk Board, and beef under the Livestock Commission. Last year we had the Bacon Act, and assistance with regard to fertilisers was given to the farmers under the Agricultural Act, 1937. Under this Bill, there are to be standard prices for oats, barley and sheep. There is little left out now, except possibly fruit. If all these things are covered, why are wages left out? To my mind it is an essential issue, and I agree that there are plenty of farmers now who pay two pounds a week. I know that perfectly well, for the simple reason that they cannot get the men otherwise. There is a scarcity of labour, particularly of skilled men, who are already having two pounds and also of the general men with wages of 33s. to 36s. but many a farmer
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1244</span>
will pay more than that for a good man. I have lived in a parish for 44 years and farmed in that parish and have seen very great changes. I remember the time when far more men were employed, far less machinery used and the wages were much lower, and I have seen the tendency for fewer persons to be employed, more machinery used and higher wages. One may regret that there are not so many employed, but mechanisation is proceeding apace and we have to see that those who do remain will receive the best possible conditions.<br><br>
It is true that farmers have had a very bad time. I do not agree that there are people making a lot of money; there may be a few, but I have seen families come in and start a certain line of agriculture and make money for a while and then something goes wrong and out they go. I have seen farms ruined by over-sheeping; I have seen men start dairying and do well for a time and then disease breaks out. Perhaps the statistics are of those people who for a few years did very well, but the statistics do not tell the ultimate story, and the real fact is that the lot of the average farmer is very hard. He has a long, hard and difficult struggle, but in spite of all that I say that cheap wages are bad, and the best possible thing is to pay the best possible wages to the men. On a grass farm I know that my labour cost, in spite of the fact that I pay more than the agricultural wage, is not much more than 26 per cent of the total expenditure so that 40s. would make very little difference. Of course, I am prepared to admit that on the arable lands in East Anglia and the Down country it is a higher percentage, but even there improvement in methods would make it possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. De la Bère</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have exercised restraint throughout the whole of this Committee but there are times when restraint ceases to be a virtue. As to this new Clause, I do not think it is very happy in drafting, I do not think it covers the exact ground I should wish, nevertheless I shall support it, because it is never the right time, it is never the right place, it is never possible to do anything for the agricultural labourer. The hon. Member for Stourbridge (Mr. R. Morgan) said I could not meet my people. I do not mind whether they vote for me, or against me, or sideways, but there is here a principle, that the man who is doing the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1938-1939V000P0I0619">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1245</span>
work is worth a proper wage. If any hon. Member says he is sympathetic, why does he not demand that the Minister of Agriculture, whoever he may be, shall give an assurance that this matter shall be dealt with without further delay. I know what the answer would be: that he could not possibly afford it; the Government could not entertain it; that it is quite impracticable. I answer him in the same breath: that it is undiluted nonsense. It can be done; it must be done. The agricultural labourer must have a fair deal and a square deal. I am going to support the new Clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ridley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The speeches made by the hon. Member for Stourbridge (Mr. R. Morgan) and the hon. Member for Evesham (Mr. De la Bere) will be very warmly welcomed by my colleagues on this side of the Committee, and I hope they will be joined by other hon. Members. Nobody was surprised that the Minister of Agriculture opposed the Amendment. There have been some substantial revolutions in Tory policy in the last year or so but the revolutions will have to be more substantial for official support. The hon. Member for Stourbridge commented on the fact that some warmth had been brought into this Debate. Warmth of that character only arises from the depth of one's opinion. Mine arises from my personal experience. My forebears were born in the hungry 'forties; I was born in poverty after the hungry 'forties and for the first years of my life I lived in one agricultural labourer's cottage after another, under conditions of prosperity in agriculture. I have seen the plough going deeper and deeper; I have seen the potato yield increase; I saw prices rise and saw men go to work from dark to dark for 16s. a week when potatoes were making £5 and £6 a ton. These patient men who till our soil deserve all the sympathy this Committee can give and it will be doing a fine and generous thing by placing on the Statute Book a Measure which will ensure them a decent wage. Just as we have guaranteed the price of oats, barley and sheep so there should be a guaranteed price for human labour and men should see their families being properly fed and clothed and sheltered.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wilfrid Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe this wage can be paid. It is being paid in a very large number of cases. In my county the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1246</span>
minimum wage is 42s. Wages in the North of England always have been higher. I am perfectly confident that this is a practicable proposition, and unless the Government and the Minister do apply themselves to this problem there will not be agricultural workers left on the land. If they want to see a prosperous agricultural community, they have to provide reasonable conditions. If not, the shortage of labour will become a major problem, and unless they will face up to this fact and accept the principle of this new Clause they will have to do so in the future and introduce schemes for getting men back on to the land. The fact of the situation is that the largest proportion of men who have left the land are the young men. That points to a very dangerous situation, in which we are going to be left either with lads or with men who are decrepit. I would add that word of warning and request the Government to accept the principle involved in this proposed Clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Dorman-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not a question of accepting the principle of the new Clause. Naturally, one would accept the principle that the men should be properly paid. We are asked to accept an Amendment which the hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. J. Morgan) himself says is almost impracticable to carry out in its present form. He says, with great trust: "Turn it over to the Department; they will find other words and make it work," but I am afraid that trust would be falsified, because it is impossible, as I see it, to make this particular method work in this Bill. As I have said, I sincerely hope—and I would like it to be known throughout the country—that if, in fact, this Bill is, as I hope it is, going to do good to agriculture, then I want to see the farm workers get their fair share of it. I want to see that, and the Government want to see it—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Riley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Put it into the Bill, then.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Dorman-Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The difficulty is the machinery of actually putting it into the Bill and getting it on to these three commodities. I am perfectly certain that every fair-minded man in this Committee will appreciate that there is, in fact, a difficulty, however much I might like to do it and where my sympathies are—and I do not think there is any secret about that. Beyond making that definite statement—and the Wages Committee can take due

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1247</span>
note of it—if, in fact, we do get the increased prosperity that one hopes and wishes, that the labourer also will get his fair whack out of that, I am afraid that in spite of the arguments used I cannot possibly accept the Clause because we could not make it workable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tinker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is hardly doing himself justice. I expected when he got his present position that he would take a bold policy and, while dealing with the farmers, have some regard for the men. Here is an opportunity by which he can show in a practical way that he really feels for the men in their position. I have heard in agricultural debates on the Floor of the House of Commons about the land being depleted of farm labour. Why? Because the wages are too low. If you want to keep the men on the land, you must pay them a decent wage. We have had to fight for the miners. It was always said that enough money could not be found for them, but when they</span></p>

<p>organised themselves, the money was found. So it can be found for any industry that is essential for the nation. Just as mining is essential for the nation, so agriculture is essential. If you want agriculture to prosper you have to pay the men who have to work on the land. Will anybody say that £2 a week is outside what men ought to have? It is not enough; it ought to be more than that. I did expect that at this time of the day, recognising the progress that has been made on the Conservative side, they would have welcomed such an opportunity. I hope that those who are bold among the leaders of the Conservative party will take courage, as has been suggested by several hon. Members opposite, and vote and show they are not tied down to the policy of keeping low wages.</p>
