	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary, Privy Council Office (Mr. Paddy Tipping)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Ministerial and Other Salaries Order 1999.</p></blockquote>
I am sure that other Committee members will be as delighted as I am to see you in the Chair, Mr. Stevenson—I am sure that you will keep our proceedings in order. I know that you are familiar with payment rates and remuneration packages at different institutions in Europe, which is a subject that has recently attracted press interest. I anticipate that you will help us to exercise sound judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the order is to implement increases in salary for various Ministers and certain other office holders in the House of Lords. The increases were recommended by the independent Senior Salaries Review Body in its report No. 43 in March 1999. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister announced the Government's acceptance of the recommendations in a written answer on 31 March 1999 at column 716. Details of the report and the written answer have been circulated to Committee members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The procedure is that such changes of salary—by which I mean an increase of salary other than the normal annual uprating—are authorised by an Order in Council under the relevant sections of the Ministerial and Other Salaries Act 1975. That Act requires that the text of the order be approved in draft by each House before being submitted to Her Majesty. I invite the Committee to provide such approval today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be helpful if I listed the several offices in the House of Lords that will be affected by the changes. They are: Ministers of State, Parliamentary Under-Secretaries of State, the Government Chief Whip and Deputy Chief Whip, the Leader of the Opposition and the Opposition Chief Whip. I anticipate that the inclusion of the latter two posts will lead to some cross-party enthusiasm. However, I understand all too well any reservations that there may be about giving extra support to Whips. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson) will excuse me for saying that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The SSRB recommended, and the Government accepted, equivalent increases for the Chairman of Committees and the Principal Deputy Chairman of Committees. Although those salaries do not appear in the order, they will be implemented administratively when it comes into force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The individual increases are set out in the order. The simplest way to think of them is that they will increase the salaries of each of the posts that I
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
mentioned by £8,500, in addition to the standard annual uprating, which other ministerial posts have received. That produces the figures that the order contains.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The increases are quite substantial. The recommendations reflect the SSRB's finding that since the 1996 changes to the pay arrangements for Ministers in the House of Commons, the salaries of the posts in the upper House have fallen behind to an unreasonable extent. The proposed one-off increase is broadly equivalent to the amount by which the salaries of Members of Parliament that are paid to Ministers in the House of Commons were abated before the 1996 changes, and so restores the relativity. The arguments, which the Government accept, are set out in detail in chapter 4 of SSRB report No. 43, which I circulated to Committee members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order will implement precisely the SSRB's recommendations, and I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.34 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Lansley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Cambridgeshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Stevenson. I share the Minister's pleasure in serving under your chairmanship. Today is my first opportunity to do so, and I look forward to future opportunities. We intend to be as constructive as possible and, as ever, I hope that we can reach a ready measure of agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will be grateful to the Minister for explaining the order's purpose. It may be helpful if I confirm at the outset that, as in another place, the official Opposition support the proposed increases. None the less, I want to make a number of points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order and the changes that it will introduce may be regarded as unfinished business arising from changes to ministerial and related salaries recommended by the Review Body on Senior Salaries in its 38th report, published in July 1996, to which the Minister briefly referred. In it, the SSRB recommended that, in addition to their ministerial salary, Ministers should receive the full parliamentary salary, on the grounds that a Minister has the same constituency responsibilities as a Back Bencher. The Minister will doubtless concur that the desire and need to continue to serve one's constituents is a key contributory factor to Commons Ministers' very high work load.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some members of the Committee, at least, will recall that, until July 1996, the parliamentary pay of Commons Ministers was abated by, according to my calculations, £8,425. After that date, Commons Ministers' salaries rose correspondingly. The relativity of Lords Ministers' pay and Commons Ministers' pay has varied over time. As a result of the 1996 changes and the large, additional increase in MPs' pay at that time, a big gap opened up between Commons Ministers' pay and Lords Ministers' pay. In 1996, the SSRB recognised the need to make further recommendations on those relativities, but did not have time to do so. It set out to remedy the matter in its 43rd report, which was issued in March of this year. The order, which relates to Lords Ministers below Cabinet rank, the Leader of the Opposition in the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0412">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
Lords and the Opposition Chief Whip in the Lords, follows through the report's recommendations with, as the Minister said, the application of an annual uprating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After taking evidence, the SSRB stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We were persuaded that the responsibilities of Ministers and PUSSs, while different in the two Houses, are on balance broadly equivalent. By contrast, we were not persuaded that the responsibilities carried by Whips in the Lords were as onerous as those in the Commons."</p></blockquote>
I am sure that the Government Whip will concur with that. Technically, the Opposition Benches in this Committee are a Whip-free zone, but perhaps my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet (Sir S. Chapman) is standing in in that stead.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Sydney Chapman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chipping Barnet)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As acting Whip for the hordes of my colleagues, I feel power coursing through my veins. For the record, I must admit that, in better days, I was a Government Whip for six and a half years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lansley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend reminds me—once a Whip, always a Whip.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the SSRB and the views of Ministers in successive Governments, the principal underlying determination of salary should be responsibility. Therefore, the SSRB did not set out to raise Lords Ministers' salaries to the level of Commons Ministers' salaries, because the latter reflects unique constituency responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister said, the SSRB went on to recommend a one-off salary increase for Lords Ministers of £8,500. As the report states, that sum
	<br><blockquote><p>"is broadly equivalent to the amount by which the Parliamentary salary paid to Commons Ministers was abated prior to"</p></blockquote>
the 1996 changes. We should note that the total salary paid to Members of this House at that time—1 July 1996—was increased by a further £9,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even allowing for the fact that the salaries of Commons Ministers below Cabinet rank did not increase between January 1996 and April 1998, the relationship between total salary in the Commons and the Lords has shifted decisively towards the Commons. That will remain true, even allowing for the effect of the order. It is interesting that the answer given by the Prime Minister on 31 March 1999, although reflecting the SSRB report, also said that the implementation in relation to Lords Ministers "restores the relativity."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 31 March 1999; Vol. 328, c.715.] That is not exactly true, because the relativity that applied before the 1996 changes was a much closer one than will apply now, even allowing for these changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give the Committee an example. In January 1996, a Minister of State in the House of Commons would have received a total salary of £56,785 and a Minister in the House of Lords would have received £50,238. Following the proposed changes, a Minister of State in the Commons will receive £77,047, whereas a Lords Minister will receive £64,426. It is, therefore, apparent that there will be a wider differential, both absolutely and proportionately, between a Minister in the House of Commons and a Minister in the House of Lords. That is entirely due to the full parliamentary
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
salary drawn by Ministers in the House of Commons in addition to their ministerial pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, those relative salary levels are subjectively determined. There is no objective test to compare the responsibility carried by House of Commons Ministers alongside their constituency responsibilities with the departmental, and wider, spokesmanship responsibilities held by Ministers in the Lords, who often speak to a wider brief than that of their departmental portfolio.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the different party balance in the Lords, compared to that of this House, it is arguable that many Members on the Opposition Front Bench in the Lords carry a significant responsibility. of all those who speak for the Opposition in this place, only the Leader of the Opposition—	<i>[Interruption]</i>—and the Opposition Chief Whip draw a salary. However, we do benefit from our parliamentary salaries as Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Cawsey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brigg and Goole)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members are supposed to share it out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lansley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. Moreover, when I said "speak for the Opposition", I was deferring to the proposition that the Opposition Chief Whip's job is not to speak for the Opposition. None the less, if Labour Members wish to correct me, we can debate the point as to whether the Chief Whip is a spokesman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those of us who speak for the Opposition in other capacities in the House of Commons draw no other salary than our Member's parliamentary salary. Front Bench Opposition spokesmen in the Lords, other than those affected by this order, benefit only from the per diem allowance, as do Back Bench Members of the Lords. Without over-egging the point, I hope that the Committee will appreciate that a number of Opposition Front Benchers in the Lords carry a significant burden of work, without the kind of recompense attracted by a Member of this House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The SSRB report recognises that this is a short-term solution for a transitional House of Lords. I shall not prevail on the Minister to tell us exactly how short term or long term the solution will be. It would, however, be a pleasure to draw him on the subject of what respective responsibilities there might be between Ministers and Front Benchers, and between Government and Opposition, in the Lords following this transitional solution, although I suspect that he will not be drawn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever should happen—and I think that the Minister should respond to this point—I hope that the Government will ask the SSRB to make further recommendations to take proper account of the responsibility falling on the Front Benchers in another place, in the light of further proposals for the reform of the House of Lords.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier, there is common ground on both sides of the House in relation to the principle that salaries should be determined in relation to responsibilities. In that respect, the SSRB has, as one would expect, considered the Lords Ministers in general, not in particular. It has not sought to allocate any particular salary to any particular
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0413">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
Minister, in the light of a particular Minister's responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I draw to the Committee's attention the fact that the responsibilities of some of the Ministers in the group to which the order applies have changed recently. I was interested to note, given the importance which the Government profess to give to the House of Lords compared with the House of Commons, that in the departing Administration in 1997 17 Ministers of below Cabinet rank in the House of Lords would have been covered by the order. Interestingly, there are now 20 such Ministers, among whom are Lord Macdonald of Tradeston and Lord Sewel. Lord Macdonald was formerly unpaid, but has drawn a salary since May. Both are in the Scottish Office and held responsibilities prior to 1 July which have since then been transferred to the Scottish Parliament. The question is simple. If those Ministers no longer have substantive responsibilities, on what basis do the Government propose that they should be entitled to draw a full ministerial salary? With that question and with the longer-term issues of ministerial responsibilities in the Lords yet to be determined, on which I should be grateful for the Minister's assurance, I extend the Opposition's support to the measure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.46 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Tyler 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Cornwall)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome your chairmanship of the Committee, Mr. Stevenson. As you have a reputation for swift and efficient business, I am sure that you will agree that if I can find points of agreement with other speakers, I should deny myself the privilege of repeating what they said. However, I am the only person in the Room with a completely objective view of the matter, because my party will not benefit in any way from the proposed increases. As all other views will be subjective, I hope that you will forgive me, Mr. Stevenson, if I spend a little time analysing the significance of the increases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 43rd report of the SSRB gave a useful background, but does not do what any sensible body outside the House would do when reviewing salaries. It does not ask why; it does not ask why now, as the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) asked; it does not identify precisely the role of the people concerned, and it does not identify whether the nation's taxpayers are receiving value for money. I propose to touch on those issues briefly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister explained, in the words of the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire, that this is unfinished business. The great advantage of unfinished business is that it can be left unfinished for as long as wanted. I still find it difficult to know precisely why the proposal has come before us now when, as has been mentioned, we are about to embark on major reform of the House of Lords, which should have important implications for the proposals in front of us. I hope that the Minister will respond more precisely to the time scale for such decisions hereafter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the question "Who?". We all know what a Minister of State is, but it is difficult to know what the Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
Arms does. Is there still an Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms? Are they all male? Does the holder of the post have to be male? How is he recruited? Is there a problem with sex discrimination? The Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms must exist or it would not be necessary still to have a captain. If there has been a change in the role because the corps no longer exists, surely the remuneration for that job should also change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know all about the Parliamentary Secretary other than the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury, but I thought that the Captain of the Queen's Bodyguard of the Yeoman of the Guard was a minor role in the opera of that name. I did not realise that there was such a post in the Building which carries a substantial salary. What precisely are the terms of reference for the job? Is it open to all comers in the House of Lords or is there some form of discrimination?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Lord in Waiting must be a pseudonym for a Whip, but as Chief Whip for my party and a member of the Whips' trade union, as well as party spokesman, I have never regarded the Tory view that a Whip should be a political eunuch as a principle that one should follow as a matter of course. A Lord in Waiting implies a quite different role from the role that I understand is performed by a Whip in the other place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far, my objective view has confined me to questioning and probing the order, but that changes when we come to regulation 3, which I believe requires special attention from Government Members. Regulation 3 is all about putting public funds into the Conservative party, which is firmly against the idea of state funding. That should be viewed in the context of the revelations today in 	<i>The Times,</i> that the Conservative party receives huge sums of money from gentlemen with offshore billions at their disposal. We should also remember that the Neill Committee recently recommended, and the House recently approved, the sum of £5 million in state funding for the Conservative party. Yet this afternoon, we are being asked to provide a bit more cash to that party, which is firmly against the proposition that taxpayers, money should be used in any way to prop up political activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Neill Committee recommendations, which are relevant to the order, added considerable funds to the parliamentary Conservative party in both Houses. There is a new £500,000 subvention from the taxpayer to contribute to the work of the Conservative party. In addition, there is an increase of—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Regulation 3 relates precisely to that issue. The sum that it is now proposed should be paid to the Leader of the Conservative Opposition in the House of Lords— of course, after reform, it is questionable whether it will still be the Conservative party, but it is at present—is £55,631, and the sum to be paid to the Chief Opposition Whip in the House of Lords is £51,161. In my book, as well as in my constituents' book, those are considerable salaries. The Committee should ask whether we are getting value for money. In addition, both those officers and members of the Conservative party in both Houses receive a considerable amount of aid in kind, in the form of cars, chauffeurs, newspapers and staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should at least ask the Minister when the whole system will be reviewed in the context of reform of the other place. Secondly, can the Minister give an undertaking to communicate to his noble Friends, who are currently discussing the form of support for other Opposition parties in the House of Lords and the so-called Cranborne money—comparable to Short money—that those sums should be taken into account in deciding how best to ensure that all political parties perform their proper function in scrutinising the work of Government in both Houses?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.53 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Sydney Chapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make three short points, but I am encouraged to make an observation in the light of the contribution that we have just heard from the hon. Member for North Cornwall. The hon. Gentleman claims to be, uniquely, totally disinterested in the subject that we are discussing. However, hon. Members on both sides of the Committee can claim to be totally disinterested because we are not members of the House of Lords. This draft statutory instrument relates entirely to certain salaries in the House of Lords. I make that point with all the good will that I can muster; I have no ambitions to go to the other place, as we are encouraged to call it. I console myself with the dream that if, for an unexpected reason, I were invited to go there, I would, given the name of my constituency and my habits, take the style and title of Lord Augustus Barnet. I shall make no further comment on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate the Minister on his clear and concise speech on the statutory instrument. I also congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire on the way in which he responded to the Minister. I have three points to make. First, I appreciate that certain Ministers, the Leader of the Opposition and the Opposition Chief Whip are the subject of this draft statutory instrument. Will the Minister confirm that that is the entire list, and that it does not include the Chairman of Committees or the Principal Deputy Chairman of Committees? Presumably, if there were more Liberal peers than Conservative ones, Liberals rather than Conservatives would draw the salaries of Chief Opposition Whip and Leader of the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, Members of the House of Lords do not receive a salary but do receive other expenses, which I
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
shall not try to list as I cannot remember them. It would be helpful if the Minister were to tell the Committee what emoluments Members of the House of Lords receive, and whether Ministers draw those emoluments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly—this has been alluded to by the hon. Member for North Cornwall and my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire—in the event of a reformed House of Lords membership, which is a distinct possibility, legislation may be passed that will make it possible to pay a salary to Members of the reformed House of Lords. I do not want to enter the argument about whether that is good or bad, but, if it happened, a revised statutory instrument would have to be introduced. I am sure that the Minister will agree that additional salary or income for Ministers, or for the Leader of the Opposition, would have to be adjusted. It would be unfair if they were to continue to receive the salaries proposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister can provide the necessary assurances, I am happy to support the draft statutory instrument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.57 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Healey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wentworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly to welcome and support the order, and I welcome the opportunity to serve, albeit briefly, under your chairmanship, Mr. Stevenson. Having spent more than 80 hours with the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire in the Committee that considered the National Minimum Wage Bill, it is good to see him speaking from the Front Bench rather than the Back Bench.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also a pleasure to serve in support of the Parliamentary Secretary, Privy Council Office, my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood (Mr. Tipping). There is a certain irony to him representing the Government on this issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a delicate area; Members of Parliament are in the unusual position of voting to approve the salaries of colleagues and fellow parliamentarians. We should pay tribute to the work of the Senior Salaries Review Body, which makes that a much easier job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his written answer on 31 March 1999, the Prime Minister, in announcing the publication of the two reports from the SSRB—to which my hon. Friend the Minister referred—concluded that the Government were not persuaded by the arguments for the central provision of IT equipment for Members' offices, in the House and in constituencies. That is a pity, and I hope that the Government will review that judgment. The Government have said that there may be advantages to the central purchase of IT equipment for those Members who avail themselves of that facility. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister said that the Government proposed to invite the Information Committee to explore that option further and to report its views to the House. Has the Information Committee been invited to consider that matter, and what progress has it made?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I shall start where my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet left off vis-a-vis the Liberal Democrats. It is staggering to say that one has no interest in the matter. According to the latest research paper from the House of Commons Library, which is, admittedly, a year out of date, the Liberal Democrats received nearly £500,000 up until March 1999 in so-called Short money. I gather that that sum has been greatly augmented since then and that we should also consider the £31,000 of so-called Cranborne money. It is ludicrous to say that one has no interest in the money that is paid to politicians in this place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way in a moment. My hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire said that there was a question about whether Scottish Ministers should be allowed the full increase, because their responsibilities have been devolved to, I believe, a group in Edinburgh which the Liberal Democrats help to run. The hon. Member for North Cornwall must have great difficulty approaching this matter with objectivity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lorna Fitzsimons 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rochdale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree with me that the position of the hon. Member for North Cornwall could be more honest? When Liberal Democrats are in control in a council, they award themselves greater council allowances, on average, than do Labour-controlled or Tory-controlled councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sure that all Committee members appreciate the difficulty that I am placed in and want to rush to my assistance. My view is that all Committee members have an interest—if not, they would not be here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Mr. Stevenson. I receive only the humble salary of a Back Bencher, and I do not seek more than that—I am perfectly happy with my lot.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also declare that I receive only a Back Bencher's salary, and I have no complaint about that. However, I find it hard to understand the value-for-money argument, which is strongly supported by Conservative Members, and its application to the order's proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gather that, as always, the Liberal Democrats want to join both sides of the argument. I hope that they resolve the matter to their satisfaction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make one or two simple points. First, I remember a debate in the House of Commons in which we had to approve a special statutory instrument to pay a salary to the Solicitor-General, which I believe reached the princely sum of £80,000 from April 1998. What is he now paid and what will he be paid as a result of the order—I gather that is not in the Cabinet, but that he is a Minister in the House of Lords?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we approved the order, money was tight and no money could be found for the Minister for Women.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
I said that it was rather paltry of the Government not to find any money—it involved discrimination and grounds for Labour Members to join me in opposing the proposal. What is the current position? Given the extra largesse that the Government have found, can some be found for her, so that she does not feel discriminated against?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I believe that a previous temporary arrangement was made in respect of the House of Lords in 1911. It has taken until now to change that. If we went to another stage in reform of the House of Lords, would that involve greater costs than those proposed in the order, and would not that create competition for those glorious new offices that are being built across the way on the corner of Whitehall?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.4 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the general support that the order has received. I must inform the hon. Member for Chipping Campden that his abilities as a Whip have declined a little through lack of use because all members on the Opposition Benches have managed to speak and my hon. Friend the Member for Delyn has ensured that speed has been achieved in the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Hanson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Delyn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are worth it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is typical of the Whips that their traditional role of silence is punctuated by comments that advance themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of small points have been made. My hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth (Mr. Healey) asked what happened to other SSRB recommendations. That is obviously outside the scope of the order, but the Information Committee was asked to examine the matter and has reported. Discussions are taking place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lorna Fitzsimons</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I comment on the position of my hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth and the disappointment of many of us on the Back Benches at the missed opportunity of the SSRB? We want a forceful recommendation to be made to the Information Committee on the gains that could be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I realise that the hon. Member for Wentworth was referring to the SSRB report, to which the Minister also referred. Strictly speaking, that is not part of the order and I am sure that the Minister will want to reflect that in his response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall reflect on that, Mr. Stevenson, and I shall ensure that the comments are passed to the appropriate quarters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Chipping Campden—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Sydney Chapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Chipping Barnet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am so sorry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Cornwall referred to what one of my hon. Friends whispered were fancy titles—Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms and Captain of the Queen's Bodyguard of the Yeoman of the Guard. I confess that I am from the modernising wing of my party and I am not entirely sure of the range of responsibilities of those posts. I am conscious that the holders need not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0416">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
be gentlemen and could be female. I shall write to the hon. Gentleman and spell out the exact responsibilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. Can he tell me whether either of the posts to which I referred have ever been occupied by a female incumbent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot tell the hon. Gentleman now, but I shall tell him in a rapidly expanding letter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about the role of Lords in Waiting. They are Whips in the other place, but on occasions they speak on a wide range of Government matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Chipping Barnet asked whether the ministerial posts named in the order were the only ones to benefit. I should have made it clear that the Chairman of Committees and the Principal Deputy Chairman of Committees will also enjoy salary rises. That is not covered in the order, but will be done administratively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) asked about the position of the Solicitor-General and during my research for our debate, I read his earlier comments. There will be no change in salary. However, there have been changes in ministerial responsibilities in respect of women. The Leader of the House of Lords now speaks principally on women's issues and is supported by one of the Ministers of State at the Department of Health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire asked about Scottish Ministers in the other place and other hon. Members also referred to that in passing. The Secretary of State and his supporting team still have an important function in the House to ensure that the voice of Scotland is heard at Westminster. I ask hon. Members to reflect on the Speaker's statement to the House on devolution issues only yesterday, which made it clear that, in her view, this is a moving canvas, and that the full implications of the policy initiative are not yet clear. I believe that that is a forceful way forward. As we see the benefits of devolution, it will be necessary to make changes, just as night follows day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been some discussion about the extent of financial support for Opposition parties, principally in the other place but also in the Commons. Everyone has an interest in that. I am delighted that this Government have brought forward proposals on Short money that give real extra resources to all Opposition parties. I know from experience how difficult life is in opposition. I make no bones about it: to increase the level of financial support for Opposition parties by 2.7 times is a remarkable step forward. As the hon. Member for North Cornwall knows, the matter has yet to be concluded, and efforts
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
are being made to resolve certain outstanding issues. Nevertheless, I listened to his comments, and I shall ensure that my colleagues also take them on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire said, Opposition spokesmen in the other place work hard for little remuneration. During the Lords debate on the order, the Chief Whip in the other place replied to that point, which was forcefully made. There appears to be some understanding of the problems involved, to which a return may be made at a later date. As members of the Committee acknowledged, that date will arrive when progress is made on changes to the House of Lords' structure. The hon. Member for Guildford reminded us that temporary measures were put in place in 1911. I am pleased and proud to say that big constitutional changes have taken place during the past two years. My hon. Friends look forward with keen anticipation to major changes in the composition of the other place. I believe that we shall achieve those changes within a few weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The House of Lords Bill has completed its Report stage in the other place. We await Third Reading, but it will not be long before the matter is again before the Commons. Then, the question will be how long the transitional House will last. I remind the Committee of the framework of the royal commission on the reform of the House of Lords. We expect it to produce a report by the end of this year, and I still firmly believe that the House will be able to consider its recommendations during the lifetime of this Parliament. Given the preceding 88 years' struggle, that is stepping on the accelerator somewhat. The Prime Minister and I are determined to see the process through, but it will take a little time. That is why we are considering the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The SSRs report, which, as was said, dealt with unfinished business, has been in existence for some time. The SSRB looked independently at Ministers in the other place, and it is clear that they have different but complementary duties. The view has been taken that they are not being rewarded equitably for what they should do. That is the reason for the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will support the order. I concede that, in the not-too-distant future, it will be necessary to revisit the matter because of consequent changes in the House of Lords. On that note, I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
