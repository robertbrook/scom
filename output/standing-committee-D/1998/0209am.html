	<div class='title'>CERTAIN BENEFITS TO BE KNOWN AS TAX CREDITS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed</i> [4 February]: No. 20, in page 1, line 7, at the end to insert the words 'and there shall be a childcare tax credit which shall be a component of both.'.—	<i>[Mrs. Lait.]</i></p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following: amendment No. 21, in clause 16, page 8, line 31, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"including in both cases a childcare tax credit component.".</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 22, in clause 4, page 2, line 25, after second 'credit' insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"and the childcare tax credit element of both.".</p></blockquote>
New clause 9—	<i>Division of childcare tax credit</i>—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a childcare tax credit is payable as a component of either working families tax credit or disabled person's tax credit in respect of a child or children whose parents do not live together, then that childcare tax credit shall be shared between the parents in proportion to the amount of time in the course of a year, that each of them looks after the child or children, and any regulations establishing or amending provisions relating to tax credits shall so provide.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Barbara Roche)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. May I make apologies for my hon. Friend the Paymaster General, who is with us today in body and spirit but, alas, not in voice? She has 'flu' and has no voice to speak of. I crave the indulgence of members of the Committee. I am afraid that they will have to listen to me this morning and this afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric Pickles 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brentwood and Ongar)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order; Mrs. Dunwoody. It is a cruel and unusual punishment for the Paymaster General to have to sit in the Committee through out the day. I think that she should take a lozenge and put her feet up. I would have no objection and would not regard it as discourteous were she to decide to leave.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is extremely helpful. The Paymaster General is of course responding to the rule in the House that, if a minister has been taking certain
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>82</span>
amendments, he or she must normally remain while that debate is taking place. We are grateful to the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) and particularly to the Paymaster General. We wish her well, as long as she keeps her germs to herself. Should there be an epidemic in the Committee, our sympathy might be a little attenuated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point is directed to the now silent Paymaster General. She was very helpful at our last sitting, when we asked who would be elegible. The hon. Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb) asked—it is recorded in col. 76 of our proceedings—whether a grandmother, sister or aunt could register. The Paymaster General made it clear that parents could not do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the eligibility remains uncertain. The latest pronouncement from the Library says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government are still considering possible definitions for 'eligible childcare'".</p></blockquote>
The press release from the Treasury says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A major obstacle faced by many parents with young children who want to return to work—whether they are lone parents or a couple—is the cost of childcare. A radical new feature of the WEFTC—the childcare tax credit—is designed to help remove this obstacle. Choosing to stay at home with children is of course a right that many parents enjoy, and those with a working partner can also get support with WFTC."</p></blockquote>
It goes on to say that, under the new National Childcare Strategy,
	<br><blockquote><p>"parents will be able to get help with childcare costs up to the September following the child's 15th birthday. For disabled children the childcare tax credit can be claimed until the child's 16th birthday."</p></blockquote>
In answer to an intervention from myself the Paymaster General said, referring to parents:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The simple answer is that the rules will prevent it. The eligibility criteria, in combination with the provisions of the Children Act 1989 state that paid child carehas to be involved."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee D,</i> 4 February 1999; c.77.]</p></blockquote>
She was clear about the Children Act. Therefore, our questions are straightforward and relate to the eligibility criteria.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the criteria include grandparents, aunts and uncles? Will neighbours who provide mutual support by looking after each other's children meet the eligibility criteria?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) raised a matter that goes to the heart of the problem. One of her constituents consulted the Benefits' Agency and the Employment Service about her current status. She is separated, wants to set up her own company and is concerned that, in the meantime, she may lose benefit. The Benefits Agency—and, I believe, the Employment Service said that the best way for her to retain benefit would be to set up a child-minding business. Will the setting up of such a business render a person eligible for the working families tax credit? If those questions are answered, we will move on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should begin by telling the hon. Gentleman that Labour Committee members appreciate the manner in which he responded to my point of order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0405">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>83</span>
I will do my best to answer his questions on the way in which the provision will work. As he acknowledged, the procedures, which I shall briefly recap, were set out clearly by the Paymaster general during last Thursday's Committee proceedings, the 	<i>Hansard</i> account of which I have read.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rules governing the working families tax credit will broadly follow those that now govern family credit. As was said, those rules use registered care criteria contained in the Children Act 1989 to define persons who provide eligible care for the current benefit and, therefore, for the tax credit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As many Committee members will know, many child minders are themselves parents or relatives of young children and are not currently prohibited from registering as child minders. The hon. Gentleman asked about grandparents, who will of course be able to register as child minders—indeed, child minding is an occupation that grandparents often decide to undertake. Registered child minders are in the business of providing child care and they certainly provide eligible child care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the eligibility scenario that the hon. Gentleman outlined, there must be a business relationship between the parties concerned. My hon. Friend the Paymaster General made that clear during last week's Committee proceedings and in her opening speech on Second Reading. Parents and relatives, including grandparents, can register as child minders, but family credit legislation does not consider payment between partners to be a relevant child care charge. That provision will be incorporated into the rules governing the working families tax credit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Jacqui Lait 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beckenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Financial Secretary confirm that she is widening—although not in the legislative sense—our understanding of the number and categories of people who can register as child minders?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated dissent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am now confused. I thought that the Government hoped that those people who provided informal child care, such as relatives, would remain as informal child carers and not register as child minders. I now get the impression that they will be able to register as child minders. As the child care allowance can be paid to them, the cost of the measure will sky rocket.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The hon. Lady is confused. I do not mean to be disrespectful, but that confusion was apparent from our proceedings on Thursday and her speech on Second Reading, in which she made some interesting points. Clearly, there must be a business relationship. Registration under the Bill builds on the same principles that are enshrined in the legislation that relates to family credit. If we bear in mind that we must look to a business relationship, we will avoid confusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important point. The Financial Secretary says that there must be a business relationship. Perhaps she could define that. I assume that it means a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>84</span>
regular, agreed payment. Section 71 of the Children Act states that a parent or relative of a child is not eligible for registration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The principles are exactly the same. There must be a business relationship and that involves a transaction for the provision of services for monetary reward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am becoming more and more confused about the Financial Secretary's definition of a business relationship. If people register as child minders, they are creating a business. They do not have to register as a company, but they are a self-employed business. Therefore, even if they are looking after their grandchildren, they are in a business relationship in which they will submit an invoice, get paid—I assume, by cheque—and send their returns to the Inland Revenue. They will, in effect, be running a business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then am I right that a relative could set up a child-minding business to look after, for example, his or her daughter's child in an acknowledged business relationship? Am I also right that, because informal child minders will find it worth their while to become a business, the cost of child care tax relief will soar, probably to the £4 billion predicted by the Institute of Fiscal Studies, which we contend is the likely sum?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady has always been remarkably generous. She was one of the most generous Whips I have ever known—I hope that that has not destroyed her career—and I wholeheartedly accept her remarkable contribution to Treasury matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members misunderstand the purpose of the provision. The scenario that the hon. Lady outlined could happen under the Bill, but it could equally happen now with family credit. When I read the proceedings of our previous sitting, I noted that the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) used the word "Marxist". He said that he would not accuse the Paymaster General of being a Marxist because she is the very epitome of new Labour, but the Opposition's arguments are deeply Marxist. They are suggesting that people decide how their children should be looked after solely on the basis of economic reasoning and that they will enter different relationships not on the basis of what is the best care arrangement for their children, but purely on how the new arrangements will be—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to the Minister for giving way and I would certainly not accuse her of being Marxist. The hon. Lady will remember the context of my comment—I was talking about the debasing of the language. Does she accept that she has just said that parents would not have to make change in the care of their children?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The law will offer a substantial cash incentive for them to change an existing arrangement into a substantial generator of income, by dint of filling in some forms and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0406">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>85</span>
making some applications. It is a traditional view throughout most of the political spectrum that people tend to act in their economic best interests. That change will become very attractive. Besides the points made by my hon. Friends, there is one big difference between the new arrangement and that for family credit because the former will extend to a much larger group of people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Interventions should be fairly brief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My apologies, Mrs. Dunwoody.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may say so, the hon. Gentleman's comment was slightly misleading, but not intentionally so. We are discussing the eligibility criteria as they exist in legislation. I do not accept the portrait that he painted. It is certainly not the way in which people arrange child minding and I say that as a constituency Member of Parliament and a parent of a school-aged child.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had an extensive discussion of these matters and the amendments are superfluous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This may help. Would it be fair to say—the hon. Lady has been straight with the Committee, which we appreciate—that the difference between the IFS estimate and the Government's estimate is a difference in the understanding of the way in which human nature operates?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the point that the hon. Gentleman is making. I would have more regard for it if Opposition Members had made the same points about family credit legislation, but they did not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Gibb 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I really must make some progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The child care disregard provides families with help to pay for child care costs and the extra money can at present be claimed by using registered child minders, whether or not they are grandparents. The amendments would not advance the legislation and I urge the Committee to oppose them if pressed to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the sake of the health of all of us, I am delighted, that the Paymaster General has seen the light and gone back to bed. However, I am most grateful to Treasury Ministers for their assistance in trying to untangle the problems that we have foreseen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issues raised are of sufficient concern to require further thought. In addition, we have not been able to debate a few matters that have recently come to light: taxing child benefit at 40 per cent., the interaction of that tax with working families tax credit and child care tax allowance, and the Social Security Committee's report on fraud in relation to family credit. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In other words, clause 2(1)(b) and (c) would replicate clause 2(1)(a) as well as the other clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments deal with the growing trend in legislation to transfer powers from Ministers, who are directly accountable to Parliament, to officials, who are indirectly accountable to Parliament through Ministers, so they raise an important issue of parliamentary accountability. I am aware that multiple precedents for doing so have been set by previous Governments and that many precedents exist in the current tax code for giving the board of the Inland Revenue such powers. I am also aware that, in practice, many of those functions will be carried out by officials. Indeed, most of the functions under clause 2(1)(a) will be carried out by officials, even though the Bill refers to those functions being carried out by the Treasury. The legal fiction is—and should be—that the Minister, who is directly accountable to Parliament, should carry out those functions. Indeed, the Bill transfers functions that are undertaken by the Secretary of State for Social Security to the board of the Inland Revenue and its officials.

Some in the Conservative party might argue that many such functions would be more competently handled by officials than by Labour Ministers—who am I to argue with that? In our parliamentary democracy, we elect a party and those in it to do a job, however technical that job might be. Those elected can take all the advice that they need from officials and experts, but if—having taken such advice—they make a mess of the job it is up to the people to elect different individuals or a different party. Although we live in an increasingly technical and complicated age, I hope that we continue to be run by those who are elected by the people, rather than by technicians appointed by other technicians.

That may seem a wide point to make on a technical clause, but my worry is the accumulation of such measures rather than the measure itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with some astonishment to the hon. Gentleman's remarks. It was as if the record of the previous Administration, and their move towards next step agencies, had been wiped out completely. Clearly, the two previous Parliaments escaped the hon. Gentleman's attention. He must have led a Rip van Winkle existence; he has only just come to life, in the cloak of someone who is here to protect parliamentary democracy.

What impressed me was the hon. Gentleman's straight face, which reminded me of the word "chutzpah"—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The rules of the House of Commons state that we use English. Although the word "chutzpah" is marvellous and almost untranslatable, it would be kind of the Minister to stick to Anglo Saxon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, I will. I know that I have no need to translate the word for you, Mrs. Dunwoody, but for the benefit of the Committee, I was about to do so. The best way to translate that wonderful word—which I will not mention again in this Committee, as it is not Anglo Saxon—is by means of illustration. The best illustration that I know is that of the man who murders both his parents and claims, in his plea of mitigation in court, that he should not be treated harshly as he is an orphan. I was reminded of that when I heard the hon. Gentleman's speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would change some of the transfers of functions in the Bill and it may help the Committee if I explain why the functions are transferred in such a way. Clause 2 provides for the transfer of the functions relating to the working families tax credit and disabled person's tax credit to either the Treasury, the board of the Inland Revenue or an officer of the board. The reason for the division is that the board of the Inland Revenue, which has statutory care of management powers, is responsible for the day-to-day running of the tax system. It is absolutely right that the purely administrative powers relating to WFTC and DPTC should be vested in the board. Powers affecting the levels of WFTC and of the disabled person's tax credit, or DPTC, are transferred—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I understand why the Financial Secretary is using acronyms—one does so when one is familiar with a subject—but I must counsel Committee
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>88</span>
members to give titles in full. The House trips itself up when initials are eternally used in discussions that need to be followed exactly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I absolutely agree, Mrs. Dunwoody. I shall do my best to avoid using acronyms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill also provides for the function relating to the making of decisions to transfer to officers of the board of the Inland Revenue. The Inland Revenue will remain responsible for decisions that are made by its officers, who will follow the guidance that is issued to them by the board in this respect, and it will be accountable for them to Ministers and to Parliament, which is the usual arrangement. Amendment No. 27 proposes that the function should be vested in the Treasury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is normal practice for decisions about the rest of the tax system to be made by officers of the board, and the provision simply matches that arrangement. The previous Government used exactly the same arrangement in their legislation.

Clearly, the amendment is not in accordance with the means by which legislation is normally enacted and is absolutely unnecessary. If the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am saddened by the Financial Secretary's response. She accepted in her opening remarks that there was a trend away from giving Ministers direct powers, but she displayed no sympathy towards my concerns, which is a sad reflection on the Government's tone and nature. This is a serious issue. It shows that those who care deeply about parliamentary democracy need to remain vigilant about similar proposals in the future.

I shall be brief, because the amendment involves a similar theme.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret having to be harsh with the hon.

I speak more in sorrow than in anger when I say that it displays ignorance about the duties of the board of the Inland Revenue, which will administer the tax credits. The board already has a duty to report annually to Parliament and to account for all matters for which it is responsible. The new responsibilities that the Bill will give the board will be included in the report. I see no need to duplicate such provisions, as the amendment would do. As you will be aware, Mrs. Dunwoody, duplication in legislation makes for bad legislation. Moreover, the

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment does not ask the chairman of the Inland Revenue board to report annually to the House of Commons; it asks the Minister to do so. If it is not a problem for the chairman of the board or the Minister to report annually to the House, I see no reason why the amendment should not be accepted.

This amendment is on the same theme as the previous two amendments, so I shall not detain the Committee. I am saddened by the Minister's response to this group of amendments, because I believe that Ministers should report directly to Parliament, should be accountable to Parliament and should take decisions themselves, albeit with advice from officials and experts. Again, I wait to hear what the Minister says on that theme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am slightly perplexed about why the hon. Gentleman seeks to remove the board of the Inland Revenue from these provisions. He will appreciate that this is a practical provision resulting from the fact that, as family credit awards are made for 26 weeks, when the work is transferred to the Inland Revenue, awards will still be running on. As the staff currently administering the awards will transfer to the Inland Revenue on the introduction of the tax credit, without this provision the work would have to be carried out by another part of the Benefits Agency. As the hon. Gentleman and, I hope, the rest of the Committee will appreciate, that would be an administrative nightmare for the Department of Social Security and, consequently, for claimants, which is an important consideration.

I want to be fair to Opposition Members, but I cannot believe that when they tabled the amendment they did not realise that that would be the consequence.

	<br><blockquote><p>'(4) The Treasury, in making regulations under any of the functions transferred by subsection (1) above, shall ensure that in the case of a dispute as to which member of a couple shall receive the tax credit the recipient shall, in the case of one-earner couples, be the non-earning partner, and in all other cases the mother.'.</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>90</span>
The amendment involves the important issue of purse versus wallet, as it is known in the jargon. Whether the money from the wage or benefit is received by the mother or the father, it is extremely important for the family. At present, under family credit, a cheque comes through the post or is picked up at the post office, according to how the family wants to operate its finances. It therefore comes into the family home, where, more often than not, it is received by the mother who, according to voluminous research undertaken on these matters, then spends it on the children. One of our grave problems with the Government's proposal is its effect on the established position whereby, on the whole, mothers receive the family credit top-up to the family wages. The amendment relates to our concern about what will happen where there is a dispute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have given in to pressure and have allowed couples to elect who is to receive the top-up part of the wage—the WFTC element, which replaces family credit. Although a tax credit, it remains essentially a benefit. Two-parent families can decide which parent will receive the benefit—whether it will be paid in a wage packet, be picked up at the post office or arrive, as it does now, through the post. Later amendments will press for single-parent families also to be allowed to elect to have WFTC paid to them in the normal way, through the post office or by post.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing disputed procedures that involve two-parent families. Of those receiving family credit, on which WFTC is based, about 50 per cent. are single-parent families and the remainder are two-parent families. The man is the primary or exclusive breadwinner in about 75 per cent. of those two-parent families. It is unclear how the Government intend to resolve a dispute about into whose purse or wallet the extra resource for the family budget should go to look after the children—the state's primary purpose for introducing this measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to be reassured about the form that couples will complete to receive WFTC. We are concerned that people should understand how the new arrangements work. It is reasonable to believe that most couples who will receive WFTC instead of family credit will not truly understand the change. For all the Government's protestations about the new arrangements, we are incredulous—we do not know whether people will understand what is happening and whether WFTC will contain the incentives that are not in family credit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also worry whether couples will understand how the delivery mechanisms will change and who will receive the money, which has gone to the mother in the past. We have grave concerns about how the form will be set out and how abundantly clear it will be that the wife must elect to receive the money if she wants to continue to receive it. She must understand that she will no longer be in receipt of a family credit payment and that her husband may receive the money in his wage packet. In some families—sadly, we come across them in our surgeries and hear about them from other people—husbands do not see their family responsibilities in the same light as mothers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Mrs. Dunwoody, that she is unaware that the form will go to the current recipient during the transfer from family credit to WFTC. Her comments are sadly misleading.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Kirkbride</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will have to disappoint the hon. Lady yet again, as I do not accept what she said. She does not sit on the Select Committee on Social Security and I am not sure that she speaks with great authority on its proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to be reassured about the fact that the forms are as clear as they can be. Will they be sent to current recipients only on a transitional basis? It is not altogether clear whether the Government will maintain that set-up for new recipients and I should be grateful if the Financial Secretary would explain who will receive the new forms. I am intrigued by the hon. Lady's intervention, but she has not added to the clarity of our debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that it would be helpful if the Financial Secretary made available to Committee members the draft forms, which we understand from the Child Poverty Action Group are available and in circulation in the Treasury? It would be useful if we could see those draft forms before the Committee completes its consideration of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Kirkbride</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raises an important point. It is somewhat insulting that Committee members, who are deliberating on these important issues, should be the last people to see a document that is germane to our debate—outside organisations have already had that benefit. I hope that the Minister will say whether we will see the forms. It is important that they are clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What happens if there is a dispute about the forms? The father in a family may have a propensity to drink, to gamble or to spend his money in other ways—such things
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>92</span>
happen—and, although he may not want to be unfair or unkind to his family, he might prefer the money that goes into his wage packet to remain in his wallet rather than to hand it over to the mother of the family, who needs it in her purse to spend on the children, the family's meals and the household's bills, which can arrive weekly or monthly. It is important that the Financial Secretary spells out clearly the dispute procedure, which the Bill does not make clear. What will happen for example, if both partners in a couple have to sign the form—as I believe that they will have to—but one of them does not do so? What steps are the Government taking to ascertain that both partners have understood the new arrangement? What are the presumptions about where the money will be sent and, if the form is not properly filled in, about who will receive it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen in a straightforward dispute? The Inland Revenue might contact the couple to ask why a form was not filled in. I assume that that has been thought through and that there is a procedure. We wait to hear from the Minister what it might be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There could be a genuine dispute in which the mother complains to the Inland Revenue that her partner drinks and gambles and insists that he has to have the money, which comes through his wage packet. Such a father does not understand the impact of his financial incontinence—for want of a better word—on the family budget. How will the Minister mediate in such situations? What will be the presumption as to who will receive the money? Will the Minister assure the Committee that in circumstances in which the mother protests that she wants to continue to receive the money in the forms of family credit, she will be entitled to go to the post office—as, perhaps, she already does—and put the money in her own purse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Collins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Westmorland and Lonsdale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a powerful case. Would she agree that it would be disappointing if the Minister were unable to give such an assurance, as the Chancellor made it clear that a primary reason for uprating child benefit was that it went directly to the mother? We would hope to see consistency in Government policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Kirkbride</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is being generous in expecting consistency in the Government's measures. Sadly, they are inconsistent in many areas. Not least of those is the proposal to tax child benefit while extending the working families tax credit up the income scale to £38,000 a year. Forgive me for digressing, Mrs. Dunwoody, but I was tempted. The Minister should answer those points and make it clear that mothers will be protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to end on a note of caution. Family finances are often an electrifying issue in families and can cause great upset to couples. A wider reason for our opposition to the measures is that disputes will occur in couples who are eligible for working families tax credit, and that will undermine marriages, partnerships and relationships. The Government have removed the presumption that the money will go to the mother; instead, couples will have to reach an agreement, although there may be no prospect of such an agreement. In some situations, that could increase the possibility of family break-up, which is to be regretted by hon. Members on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0410">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>93</span>
both sides of the Committee. That reinforces our view that the case has not been made for the change from family credit to the working families tax credit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to support my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride), I agree with all her points. The amendment, and that which follows it, provides the Committee with the opportunity to debate what has been referred to—in shorthand—as the purse-versus-wallet argument
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have given us many reasons why the measure is necessary. It is supposed to be about ensuring that people have an opportunity to enter employment. However, if working families tax credit is to mean anything, its primary purpose must be to support children within families. Opposition Members believe that the chosen mechanisms will almost certainly result in less money being spent on children. In the case of a dispute, the most appropriate course of action is to give the money to the person providing care at home. In most cases, that will be the mother. On Second Reading, I referred to the study undertaken by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, which estimates that, in most cases, a child is likely to receive more money from the state through the mother than through the father.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We received a briefing from the Low Pay Unit, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is however a real fear that the benefit currently paid to the principal carer, i.e., the mother, will now be transferred to the father's pay packet, which may adversely affect the family budget. Currently there are 300,000 couples where the man is a principal breadwinner—receiving a total of £900 million in FC. Although couples will be able to choose who receives the credit, payment will default to the wage-earner if no choice is made."</p></blockquote>
We recognise that family disputes are likely to occur. An earlier debate revealed that it will not be possible to split the payment between those providing care. However, we believe that, where there is a dispute, payment should default to the mother.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were given some indication of what the form will look like and it would be helpful if we could see a copy of it. Having read the proceedings of the Select Committee on Social Security on fraud and having discussed fraud with the various officers concerned, we do not believe that the system can be checked. Without the amendment, it will be increasingly vulnerable to fraud. Under the transitional and, as we understand it, the full arrangements, the mother will have to sign the form. However, it will not be possible to check whether the signature is genuine. Therefore, the Bill should make it clear that, where there is a dispute, payment should default to the mother.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove pointed out a number of problems. The man of the family may be an habitual gambler, or not particularly good at budgeting the family finances. In a marriage, one tends to know which partner is best at such things. Although one does not want to come between a husband and wife the care of the child must be the paramount consideration and must override normal considerations about the state interfering in such disputes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, organisations such as the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and the Low Pay Unit have suggested that, in most cases, children are likely to benefit
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>94</span>
more if they receive state money through the mother rather than through the pay packet of the father. For the reasons that I have given, we believe that the Government should find the amendment acceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steve Webb 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Northavon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like briefly to reinforce the arguments that the hon. Gentleman powerfully presented and to add the Liberal Democrats' support to the amendment. Either there will be disputes or there will not be. If there are no disputes, the amendment, though superfluous, would not be damaging. If there are disputes, a simple resolution process will be required. It need not be an appeal tribunal, or a hearing in which cases are made—it should be a simple, obvious and sensible rule. As far as I can see, the amendment proposes such a rule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 58 of the Social Security Committee report "Tax and Benefits: Implementation of Tax Credits" states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We recommend that the claim form…should indicate that payment will normally be to the partner at home…but that, if both partners prefer payment can be made through the earner's pay packet".</p></blockquote>
That seems entirely sensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Briefly, on a point of information that may help the Committee, on Second Reading the hon. Member for Rochdale, who has looked into these matters, added an interesting statistic to the debate. If my memory serves me right, she said that in one third of cases involving two-parent families payment was made to a joint bank account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have looked at written answers on that subject in 	<i>Hansard.</i> When the Department was asked similar questions it said that it did not have the information or that the cost of providing it would be disproportionate. There seems to be some disjunction between the information being provided by the hon. Lady—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lorna Fitzsimons</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it will help, I shall make the information that I have available to the hon. Gentleman outside the Committee. He may wish to revise his comments in the light of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. First, I hope that we are not going to have a repeat of the Second Reading debate. Any comments that hon. Members want to make should be made on amendments and our discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, sedentary interventions are unnecessary. If hon. Members have something to say, they should catch my eye. They will then have the right to say it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Webb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That you, Mrs. Dunwoody. I hope that the information will be made available to me and to all Committee members through the usual channels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raised the matter because we are discussing an amendment that specifies who should receive the money if there is a dispute. The number of cases in which the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0411">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>95</span>
money goes into joint bank accounts gives some indication of how many people share resources and how many may be in dispute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Select Committee believes that people are worried about the default position. There will be disputes—otherwise, we could leave the matter alone—and we need a simple resolution procedure because the money must go quickly to whoever should receive it. A simple rule would be much better than a decision making process or appeal process. I hope that the Government will accept the amendment with good cheer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You and I, Mrs. Dunwoody, are among those members of the Committee who have reached the years of discretion and can remember debates—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should hate to spoil your image, Mrs. Dunwoody, but I suggest that you and I can remember debates before the introduction of child benefit. Some of our debates on the matter before us are reminiscent of those debates. I know that you campaigned in the House, Mrs. Dunwoody, and I campaigned in the country for women to receive child benefit to look after their children. Fundamentally, that is what we are discussing. The principal is the same—that by and large the woman looks after the children and hence needs the money to spend on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the Government's rather idealistic view that working families tax credit and disabled person's tax credit are a reward for work, but those of us who work at the sharp end know very well that, in practice, the carer, who is usually the woman, needs the money. What concerns me is that the provision is not as generous as it could be in terms of ensuring that the maximum number of carers or women receive the money for the children under this very generous tax credit. I suspect that disputes, which may not at present arise over child benefit, may arise over the tax credit because it is so much more generous. It will make a big difference to a pay packet, and its purpose is to help the children. However, if there is the slightest temptation for a partner to keep the money, for whatever purpose, the system will create disputes. Mothers of carers may not know how much tax credit partners receive. I add my voice to those who believe that we should see the forms before the Committee completes its proceedings. The woman needs to be assured that she is receiving from the husband the amount of money that he is receiving through his pay packet. As I understand the system—we know little about it—that may not be so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Rochdale said, there will be a transitional system, which is a good idea, but it will come to an end after six months, and disputes may arise thereafter. There may be a settled agreement at the beginning, but disputes could arise after that. I accept that the forms may be complicated the first time that they are filled in, but as people get used to them, they will become more familiar with them and filling them in will become easier. The reality of the situation will sink in, the large sums of money that we are talking about will have an impact on couples' relationships.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>96</span>
I hope that the Minister can give us a much clearer definition of who can have access to the money and will move the balance towards the carer receiving it, instead of idealistically believing that the tax credit is a reward for work and hence should go to the male's pay packet rather than the female's. Problems with which we are all familiar and which have been debated since the 1970s, and will continue to be debated, will then arise, because it is in the nature of human relationships that women look after the children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important amendment, because it seeks, first, to fill a gap in the Bill and, secondly, to ascertain the Government's policy on any dispute between partners claiming WFTC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 4 of the draft Tax Credits (Claims and Payments) (Amendment) Regulations 1999 refers to what happens in the case of a couple. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the case of a claim for working families tax credit, where a married or unmarried couple is included in the family, the claim shall be made by whichever partner they agree should so claim."</p></blockquote>
That is as far as the regulations go. Neither the Bill nor the regulations say what will happen when no agreement between the partners can be reached. That leaves one to conclude that one of two things could happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first is that, because a box has not been ticked on the form through which a claim for WFTC is made, it will render the uncompleted form invalid. The Department of Social Security has been keener in recent months and years to ensure that forms are fully completed before it processes them. An incomplete form can give rise to enormous costs, as officials and civil servants try to fill in the relevant facts. I accept that it is better to insist on a completed form before any benefit is paid. If I am correct about the Inland Revenue and the WFTC form, the claim to WFTC will be invalid, simply because the partners cannot come to an agreement. That would be a harsh way to resolve a dispute between partners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The alternative is for the Government to adopt an unofficial default position that the money will be paid to the earner through the pay packet, because it is Government policy to have as much of the WFTC as possible paid through the pay roll. That is different from the family credit default position: family credit is paid in almost all cases to the mother, unless serious incapacity in the mother can be shown, in which case the father can claim the money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's response is important and will be examined closely, not only by members of the Committee but by many outside bodies such as the Child Poverty Action Group. She may argue that disputes between partners will be rare, that most couples get on—that is why they are together—and will in most cases be able to agree to whom the money should be paid, but the legislation needs to be able to cope with instances where disputes cannot be resolved. Although such instances will be rare, there will be cases where couples cannot resolve to whom the payment should be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second part of the amendment states that, where both partners are working, the money should be paid to the mother. As my hon. Friends have said, that is because, if the money is paid to the mother, more of it is generally
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0412">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>97</span>
spent on the family than when it is paid to the father. The Child Poverty Action Group says in its briefing that research shows that—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I shall not always intervene on this point, but hon. Members should use their own words. I hope that large amounts of other people's briefing will not be read into the record. It is not flattering to Members of Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was trying to paraphrase, Mrs. Dunwoody. The Child Poverty Action Group quotes the research from J. Goode, C. Callender and R. Lister in their report entitled "Purse or Wallet? Gender Inequalities and Income Distribution within Families on Benefit", which was published in 1998. They say that the presumption should be that the payment will go to the main carer of the children in one-earner couples, with an option, which the Government have granted, of making the payments to the wage earner where both partners agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Low Pay Unit cites the evidence of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar also referred. It shows that, when money is paid to the mother, more of it is likely to be spent on the family.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment therefore seeks to clarify the current position, which is unsatisfactory. It says that, for one-earner couples, the default position in the case of a dispute should be for the payment to be made to the non-earner, who is most likely to have day-to-day responsibility for the children. We had originally drafted an amendment which said that the default position should be that the money would be paid to the spouse or partner who has responsibility for the child, but, in a couple, both spouses have responsibility for the child, albeit one of them may be out at work. The easiest way to deal with that is to state that the default position should be that the money will be paid to the non-earner—the spouse or partner at home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of a dispute between a couple where both partners are working we believe that because of the evidence from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and other outside groups the default position should be payment to the mother. That is also the present position under family credit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Social Security Committee felt strongly about that issue. Its report welcomed the Government's decision to allow couples to choose which partner could receive the WFTC, but is expressed a concern—I shall quote just one sentence—saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is crucial that the option of payment to the non-wage earner in a coupleshould be actively presented in a positive way."</p></blockquote>
That was the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar made about the design of the forms. The Select Committee's recommendation is that the default position should be to make payment to—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. A record is being taken. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will tell us not only the full name of the report but the page from which he is reading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>98</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. Mrs. Dunwoody. It is taken from paragraph 58 of the report, "Tax and Benefits: Implementation of Tax Credits", HC 29, at page xviii. The report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This could be done by making payment to the partner at home the 'default' position."</p></blockquote>
The Social Security Committee is right to recommend that default position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present position is unacceptable. Neither the Bill or the regulations state what should happen in the case of default. The absence of clarity in the Bill worries outside bodies. It should be unacceptable to the Committee that such a glaring gap in the legislation has not been filled. The amendment seeks to fill it. If the Government are not prepared to accept it as drafted, we shall accept an assurance from the Minister that they will table an amendment on Report to fill that gap.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I acknowledge that this is an important subject. I hope to give the hon. Member for Bromsgrove the reassurance that she seeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady asked to see the draft forms. I am not sure whether previous Administrations took such steps—when the previous Government were introducing their legislation on family credit, did they provide the appropriate draft forms? However, I should be perfectly happy to let the Committee have copies of the draft forms. In a spirit of openness and helpfulness, I shall also make my officials available to talk Committee members through the forms, if that would be helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) made some interesting remarks. I could hardly believe it when the hon. Member for Bromsgrove attacked the Government on the grounds of inconsistency—I was quite incredulous. The hon. Member for Beckenham said that the Bill was generous, but that is at variance with what Conservative Front-Bench spokesmen have been saying. The situation is incredible—the hon. Lady, who is an ex-Whip, is clearly just a little bit off message.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should examine the subject as a whole. Mrs. Dunwoody, you might want me to discuss the amendment—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I insist that we discuss the amendment, because that is what is before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, Mrs. Dunwoody. Being a natural coward, I would not want to incur your displeasure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an answer to a parliamentary question asked by the hon. Member for Northavon, my hon. Friend the Paymaster General said on 31 March that the Government's presumption was that when a couple disagreed about which of them was to receive the credit, it would normally be paid to the partner who mainly cared for the children. I assure Committee members that that is what we intend to do. However, the Bill is not the place for detailed rules of that sort. The bill will give the Treasury and the Inland Revenue the necessary powers to make the regulations that will set out the rules by which the working families tax credit will operate.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>99</span>
As has already been said, two sets of draft regulations, which relate to the powers that are contained in the clause, were placed in the Library on Monday. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton referred to regulation 4 of the draft Tax Credits (Claims and Payments) (Amendment) Regulations 1999, which fulfil our commitment to give couples a choice about who should receive the tax credit. They will build on the existing family credit regulations by substituting for the regulation that requires a family credit claim to be made by a woman a new regulation—the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton quoted it earlier—which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the case of a claim for working families tax credit, where a married or unmarried couple is included in the family, the claim shall be made by whichever partner they agree should so claim."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman is obviously keen sighted: he noticed that that, too, does not include a procedure for resolving disputes in which partners do not agree about who should claim—and therefore receive—the tax credit. The explanation for that is simple. The best way to deal with a dispute between partners, which we hope will be a relatively rare occurrence—indeed, that was reinforced by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton who used the word "rare"—is by allowing the Inland Revenue to exercise its duties of care and management of the tax credit system and, exceptionally, to allow the WFTC application form to be signed by one partner rather than both partners. But the application form will need to show the family circumstances, including information about the other partner's income and savings, so that that award can be calculated correctly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In summary, therefore, the Financial Secretary is saying that the amendment is a good idea, but that she does not want to support it now because it would be more appropriate to include it in regulations. That is not the problem. We are worried about the claim that it is best to trust the Inland Revenue. I suspect that the Government's battle-cry that we should trust the Inland Revenue, excellent though it is—I hope that it will look favourable on my tax return—will not gain them popularity. We are discussing an important point of principle which the Financial Secretary should reconsider. Surely it would be better to include the amendment in the Bill or at least in regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sometimes I fear for the hon. Gentleman, for whom I have some regard. Last Tuesday morning, there was an attack on Whips—a dangerous move when the Committee is full of current and ex-Whips. There is now an implied attack on the Revenue. I am sure that when the Hon. Gentleman has time to reflect, he will reconsider his comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I withdraw my remarks on the Inland Revenue. It is staffed by a wonderful bunch of people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Whips will have noticed the hon. Gentleman's refusal to withdraw his comments about them. I have done my best to protect him. As for his other remarks, engaging though he is, I am saying no such thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>100</span>
In cases of dispute about who should receive the tax credit, provided that the Inland Revenue has no reason to doubt the information given on both partners, it will deal with the application as though it had been signed by them both. In those circumstances, tax credit will be paid to the caring partner, either directly or through the wage packet if he or she is employed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I understand correctly, the default position in the case of a dispute will not be that the payment goes through the payroll to the person earning or directly to the carer at home, but that it will go to the person who grabs the form. The Financial Secretary is saying—she can correct me if I am wrong—that the Revenue will accept a form that has been signed by just one partner and that that person will receive the money or make the choice. Therefore, the person who controls the form will determine the resolution of the dispute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The hon. Gentleman misunderstands. The Inland Revenue will exercise its duties of care and management of the tax credit system to resolve disputes, which we hope will be rare. The new system is much better than the current system because the family credit unit has no such discretion, it always returns forms from couples with only one signature and it is impossible for a woman to get family credit without her partner's signature. Opposition Members have not referred to that situation, which the Bill improves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am somewhat concerned about the proposed new system, which will give the Inland Revenue greater discretion. However effective the Inland Revenue is—I am feeling benevolent towards the Inland Revenue because it has just paid me back some money—and in light of the Social Security Committee's recent report on fraud in the family credit system, I am concerned that the potential for fraud will be greater in the new system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady need not have that fear. The presumption will be to pay the award to the person who mainly cares for the children. That presumption should reassure her.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our way forward is the most proper and efficient way to deal with the situation—a situation about which I understand that hon. Members are concerned. We have publicly stated our commitment in that regard. That commitment will be turned into public guidance, which will accompany the application form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am more confused now than I was at the beginning of the debate on amendment No. 23, although the purpose of Standing Committees is to ascertain what is in legislation and what is Government policy.

In responding to the debate, the Minister said two things. First that, in the case of a dispute between two partners of a couple who are making a claim for working families tax credit, the Inland Revenue will pay the money on the basis of one signature on the claim form, so the money will be paid to the person who signs the form. In the case of an earner, it will be paid through the payroll, and in the case of a partner who is at home with the children, it will be paid directly. The Minister then said—after a piece of paper was handed to her by her Parliamentary Private Secretary—that there will be a presumption in favour of the partner with care of the children. Those two statements are inconsistent. What will happen if the form is signed and handed in by the earner? How does the presumption that the money will be paid to the carer of the children fit in with the fact that the form must be signed by one person, who could be the earner and who might elect to have the money paid to him or her? How can those two statements be reconciled? We cannot leave this debate until we have an answer to that question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Kirkbride</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. If one person signs the form, how will the Inland Revenue know whether a dispute is taking place and whether the form was grabbed by one person and sent off in the post the next day? Can the Inland Revenue look into people's minds?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. If the form is sent in with only one signature and there is a presumption that the money should be paid to the partner at home, but there is no dispute, the Revenue may assume that there is a dispute because the form contains only one signature. We have heard irreconcilable statements from the Minister and the Government's policy does not hold water. The hon. Lady should have another go at clarifying the issue, not only for Committee members—although their concerns should be paramount—but for people outside the House. I know that representatives of the Child Poverty Action Group and the Low Pay Unit, who are very concerned about the issue, will write to Ministers and raise their concerns with Members of Parliament until the matter is resolved. Now, the Minister has an opportunity to resolve it once and for all. What will be the proper policy in the case of a dispute between two partners? What happens when the form is submitted with one signature? To whom will the payment be made?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have done my best to try to assure the Committee. The statement that I made about the partner who mainly cares for the child was also made at the beginning of my remarks as regards the presumption that the Government have in mind. I have tried to clarify the matter for Opposition Members and I regret that I have not managed to do so. I hope that I have clarified it to the satisfaction of the other members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Kirkbride</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will forgive me for saying that she has not clarified the matter. She has raised many more questions in our minds about how
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>102</span>
the Inland Revenue intends to administer the scheme. My hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehamption amply demonstrated why we are more confused as a result of the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many groups outside the House have raised with Opposition Members the issue with which the amendment deals. Those groups will be deeply disappointed as I suspect that they will be as confused as we are by the Minister's reply.

<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0415">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>103</span>
Small Businesses among others. I will not quote in detail from their briefs, but will focus on three issues that lie behind the amendment: privacy, security and the burdensome administrative impact on small businesses and, in some cases, on the individuals concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In earlier debates in the Committee, a great deal of discussion took place on the differences in the ways in which privacy applies to family credit and to working families tax credit. It was established that, in both cases, checks must be made every few months with the employer to take the temperature of the income of the person concerned. If, as is the case with categories such as single parents, people are forced to receive the money in their pay packets the working families tax credit will, unlike family credit, appear week in, week out, or month in, month out, on people's pay slips.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Webb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In trying to ascertain the relative merits of the two amendments, which are very similar, the hon. Gentleman mentioned categories such as lone parents, who are obliged to have the credit paid through the pay packet. Is he in fact aware of other categories, or are both amendments dealing with the specific issue of lone parents?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be interested to hear the Financial Secretary's answer to that question. However, prima facie, the Conservative amendment and the Liberal Democrat amendment seem to approach the matter from the same direction, in that they deal with single parents. Will the Financial Secretary confirm whether broadening the amendments would deal with the hon. Gentleman's point?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Forcing lone parents—and perhaps other categories—to receive their money through the pay packet will allow anyone involved in the processing of pay information regularly to see whether such people are in receipt of what is a benefit in all but name. That is why the briefs of so many organisations have referred to the issues of privacy and stigma.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Privacy is important, but in some ways security is even more important. It is a sad fact that, from time to time, businesses go bust. Small businesses are more prone to such a fate than are larger businesses. Rather a lot of businesses are going bust during a recession that, officially, is not taking place. I am sorry to say that a number of small businesses in my constituency are going bust. Having been a Member of Parliament for many years, Mrs. Dunwoody, you will doubtless have received from time to time at your constituency surgery aggrieved delegations of businessmen who have gone bust, but who have yet to receive money owed to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ivan Lewis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bury, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my memory serves me right, under the previous Administration a small business went bust every three minutes. Does the hon. Gentleman recall that fact, and would he like to comment on it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do, indeed, recall the depths of a recession that was worldwide, rather than confined to this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>104</span>
The sad fact is that, under the working families tax credit, single parents will for the first time join the unhappy queue of creditors of businesses that have gone bust. Under family credit, they are paid the money as of right. As we have acknowledged, there are administrative difficulties associated with family credit, and those may be carried over. Under the present system, employees of businesses that go bust, who receive family credit, know that that benefit will continue to be paid to them through the benefit office as of right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless the amendment is accepted, single parents whose employers go bust may find not only that their wages are at risk but that their benefit is at risk. People should be able to insist that their money is paid through the Revenue, from which they can be sure they will receive a cheque, rather than through their employer, whose business may be in difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be quite wrong of me to extend the debate to consideration of this country's insolvency laws, which is one of my personal crusades.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it would.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I stand admonished, Mrs. Dunwoody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As hon. Members who have dealt with insolvency cases through their constituency surgeries know, it can take a very long time to sort out payments. Surely the Government do not want to put single parents in that wretched queue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to administrative cost. The CBI's submission, which is closely echoed by the other organisations that I mentioned, points to the additional costs involved for all employers. It says that those costs will be particularly burdensome on small businesses and we have argued, through a series of amendments, that the measure will create problems for small businesses. The CBI calls for small businesses to be exempt from the provision. It is not unreasonable for a single parent to be able to say to a small business employer, as can a parent who is one of a couple, "I do not want to impose this extra administrative burden on you. I seem to be your only employee in this situation. For goodness sake, let me deal directly with the Inland Revenue." The employer could then say, "Well, thank God for that. That is one extra piece of paperwork that I do not have to take on."

I want to pursue this important point a little further. One point of principle which the Government, the Conservatives and, I am sure, the Liberal Democrats, all share is that we want single parents to have the opportunity to work. A small business may employ only three or four people, none of whom is affected by the provision. It will know that taking on a single parent will almost certainly involve a burdensome amount of work. If it cannot say to that single parent, "Could you possibly fill in one of these forms so that the extra work goes through the Inland Revenue and does not fall to us?", that is a substantial disincentive to the business taking on a single parent. The family business with which I have most direct dealings—I declared my interest at the beginning of our proceedings: my father owns one and my wife works part-time for another—are besieged with paperwork. We must not give small businesses a substantial disincentive to take on single parents.

An additional wrinkle in the administration applies to both small businesses and single parents. An employed person may move fairly rapidly from job to job. There are a number of forms of employment in my constituency to which that applies. Many people do seasonal work picking fruit, hops and so on for a fairly short period and do different work during the rest of the year. Employers are now forced to take those people on as employees rather than treat them as self employed, for reasons that have been argued elsewhere and are way beyond the scope of the Committee. It is doubly burdensome to require those employers, on top of having to administer wages, employees' and employer's national insurance contributions, PAYE and so on for the few weeks that those employees are picking hops and fruit, to handle the working families tax credit. It is nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is often the final wrinkle—that extra straw on the camel's back—which breaks the system. The ludicrous examples, such as I have described, may ultimately undo the measure, which, from beginning to end, is a muddle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are my three arguments for why Government should not object to the amendment in principle. I have considered it long and hard, and can see no possible reason why anyone should object to it. Will the Minister not only respond to my three arguments, but explain what objection in principle there can possibly be to such an amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Webb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is grouped with amendment No. 15 in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable). Although the two amendments say much the same, amendment No. 15 is slightly narrower in scope, as there may be other marginal cases where direct payment is automatic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To assist the hon. Gentleman, I understand that, where both members of a couple work, there is no option but to have the payment made through the payroll. Therefore, amendment No. 24 seeks to allow such a couple to make the election as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Webb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that clarification. The issue about forcing payment through the pay packet relates primarily to lone parents, although I accept the further category mentioned by the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton said that the take-up for family credit is already high, but no one has yet pointed out that, for lone parents, it is even higher. The Government's own figures show that, for lone parents, a staggering 91 per cent. of family credit expenditure is taken up. Given that there are always a few people who do not take up their entitlement, such as those in transitional states who eventually will do so, almost all lone parents take up the family credit to which they are entitled. I infer from that that no significant stigma is attached to lone parents claiming family credit, because otherwise some of them would not claim it. If there is no stigma, all the Government's arguments to the effect that people feel good about something coming through the pay packet but bad about a benefit fall. Clearly, lone parents
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>106</span>
do not feel bad about claiming family credit, or they feel only marginally bad about it and are prepared to put up with it for the money—and the WFTC will be worm more money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Canterbury is right that it is hard to think of any reason why one would not want to give lone parents at least a choice about how they receive the money. Given that receiving it through the current mechanism is not stigmatising in any material sense, one can see no reason for not giving them the choice. The hon. Gentleman gave three telling reasons why we should ensure that the option is at least there. The Government would say that it is against the law to discriminate against a potential recipient of tax credit, but proving that will be inordinately difficult. If an employer chooses between one person and another who is of equal merit, it will be hard to prove that one person was rejected as a potential tax credit recipient. Another comment that we have heard is that the employer will not know, but in a small firm with few employees there are always informal conversations with prospective employees, perhaps before or after the interview, or even during the interview, when it will emerge whether the applicant has dependent children. We might wish that that were not so, but it may well be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Canterbury referred to seasonal workers who go from job to job. As I understand the regulations, when the initial claim is made the payment will go to the lone parent directly in the first place, until the employer is up and running, when it will go to the employer. If the person then changes job, a form will have to go to the Inland Revenue to say how much has been paid and that information will be passed to the next employer. In the interim, the payment will go back to the employee again and then to the second and third employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that bureaucracy seems wholly unnecessary to achieve—what? The Government have made no assessment of what forcing lone parents to get the money through the pay packet achieves. It is hard to see what it achieves, because lone parents are as able as anyone else to add together what they get through the pay packet and what they can get through a bank transfer with family credit. Many people are paid by bank transfer or get their family credit by bank transfer. Lone parents are quite able to add the two together and to understand what the return from work is: they do not need it physically on a payslip.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no wish to do the Government's work for them, but, as I understand it, their argument is that people will be more likely to find a job because they are being paid a tax credit rather than a benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mrs. Dunwoody. It is difficult to send voices in two directions. I shall shout louder.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I absolutely agree, Mrs. Dunwoody, and I apologise. I hope that the hon. Member for Northavon can hear what I am saying. I was asking him whether he

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>107</span>
thought it made a scrap of difference whether a person gets money through the pay packet or through benefit. If he believes that it makes no difference, why are we sitting here, because that makes the whole Bill fall?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Webb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Lady would expect, I have a great deal of sympathy with that point. Two categories of lone parents will move from, as the jargon has it, "welfare into work"—those who know how much money they were getting at work, supplemented by the credits, and those who do not. For those who do not, how they get the money is irrelevant; for those who do, how they get the money is irrelevant. They know that they will get the money. Indeed, they will know with more certainty that they will get the money—for all the reasons mentioned by the hon. Member for Canterbury—if it goes direct to them and is not interrupted through transitions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The charity TaxAid, which exists to help people to understand the tax system, says that, under the existing regime, firms often fail to provide P45s, P60s and payslips. Under the proposed system firms will also have to provide an outgoing employee with a certificate to say how much tax credit has been paid, so that that can go to the Revenue, which can then set up an assessment for the new firm. All that bureaucracy is not only unnecessary but will sometimes go wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making such a compelling case that I am embarrassed to intervene again. Family credit is already, with one organisation dealing with it, a complicated and burdensome matter, but at least it works. Complexity will now be introduced for a string of different employers, as well as the Inland Revenue and the recipient.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Webb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. This is a transaction between the Government and the individual. A firm is reasonably required to provide information to assist that transaction, but has no role in delivering it. As there is no benefit to be gained by forcing lone parents, possibly against their will, to take the money in this way, the Government should not do it. Therefore, I support the spirit of both amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said in my intervention on the hon. Member for Northavon, amendment No. 24 allows lone parents and either member of a couple who both work to elect to have the payment made direct to their bank or home, and not through the payroll. On Second Reading and in Committee we have debated whether the WFTC will reduce stigma. The Opposition claim that it will not; the Government say that it will. However, the Government have not told us what they expect the take-up rate to be. I was impressed when the hon. Member for Northavon cited the figure that applies to lone parents, of a 91 per cent. take-up rate on expenditure. That proves categorically that there is no stigma attached to claiming family credit, at least for lone parents. The overall figure of 85 per cent. demonstrates almost the same for other claimants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our dispute could be resolve simply by letting WFTC recipients decide whether there is stigma. If they believe that there is stigma attached when payment is made
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>108</span>
through the pay packet—after all, it is they, not Ministers, who will suffer the embarrassment of the stigma—I see no reason why they should not be able to elect to have those payments made direct into their own bank accounts or to their home. That is the view of the Confederation of British Industry, which said that single parents may wish to retain the option because
	<br><blockquote><p>"they wish to maintain confidentiality or avoid perceptions of stigma associated with payment of benefits."</p></blockquote>
That is also the view of the Institute for Fiscal Studies. In its evidence to the Social Security Committee, it said that people will observe that colleagues are receiving the WFTC, and that a stigma will be attached to receiving it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore see no reason why the Government should not give recipients of working families tax credit the option of electing to have the payment made directly. It would be kind and humane to do so, and I hope that the Government will accept either of the two amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In many ways, amendment No. 24 is the crunch amendment. It determines whether the Government believe in their measure; whether they believe that less stigma is attached to the working families tax credit than to family credit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, it was claimed repeatedly, despite the evidence, that family credit was stigmatised. Neither Opposition Members, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation nor the Child Poverty Action Group believe that. The only people who believe it are Labour Members. The amendment provides them with the opportunity to—in the old phrase—put their money where their mouth is. If they were to vote for the amendment, they would be letting the people decide. Those who feel that it would be better to receive the money though the wage packet will be able to do so, but if they prefer to receive it directly in their bank account or across the post office counter, that will also be possible. That would be in accordance with the best principles of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to address a narrow point. The Committee has discussed Marxismi and the class system, which has been most entertaining. I stand before the Committee as a champion of workers' rights—another compelling reason why people should be able to decide on the method of payment is to protect them for unscrupulous employers. My hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham referred to the informal ways in which employers could work out whether someone was receiving working families tax credit. In a similar way, it is possible to work out what kind of employer someone might be—an unscrupulous employer or something of a Jack the lad. If workers receive payment through the wage packet, the employer is put in an especially strong position. That is particularly true with regard to industrial disputes—when workers go out on strike, an unscrupulous employer will not be in a rush to make payments. That issue was raised in discussions with the Child Poverty Action Group last night, and it also worries the Low Pay Unit, which normally supports the Government on such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The response to that is in an Inland Revenue document, which—although I do not wish to incur the Revenue's displeasure—is extremely naive. It suggests that employers must act reasonably and make the payments.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0418">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>109</span>
That will simply not happen, it will give added weight to any industrial dispute by allowing employers to grind down the faces of the poor and end the dispute earlier. The workers will be denied not only wages but benefits. It may be that The Financial Secretary may find it strange to hear a Conservative Member speak in this way. I remind her that the first industrial relations legislation was introduced under a Conservative Government. I urge labour Members not to reject the message because of the messenger. Do not dismiss the point just because it is made by a Conservative Member. If people are not able to decide how to receive the benefit, it will put a considerable weapon in the hands of unscrupulous employers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right on one point: this is a crunch amendment, because it rehearses the arguments that were advanced on Second Reading, the amendment goes to the heart of the Bill and clearly exposes the political difference between Government and Opposition Members, both Conservatives and Liberal Democrats. Indeed, when I made that point on Second Reading, the hon. Member for Northavon acknowledged that there is a different view about the way in which these matters should be addressed. We want to reinforce the link between payment as a tax credit and the rewards of work, so the tax credit should be paid through the wage packet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. Is she saying that the Government are prepared to take on board the problems that will inevitably result when the carer, usually the woman, does not receive the money to which she is entitled in order to look after her children? Are the Government prepared to take that on the chin and deal with the fallout that will result?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course. The hon. Lady invites me to return to our previous debate, but she paints a scenario that I do not accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order to address valid concerns raised by many groups outside and, as I have already acknowledged, by many hon. Members, the Government decided that there should be a choice about which partner received the tax credit. Of course, the choice will be dealt with in an even-handed way that favours neither the man nor the woman. If the person who receives the tax credit is employed, the money will be paid through the wage packet. We believe that that demonstrates the rewards of work in the clearest possible way. If the couple choose to have the money paid to a partner who has no earnings or
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>110</span>
who is self-employed, it will be impossible to pay it in that way. That is why direct payment will continue for the working families tax credit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We come to the heart of the matter: families are to pay the price to maintain the smokescreen. Is the Minister really saying that she does not believe that single parents or, indeed, married couples in which both parties work, are incapable of adding up and working out what their pay packet amounts to at the end of the week? For sensible administrative and security reasons that I shall not repeat because they have already been outlined, there is a lot to be said for people having the right to choose payment through the Revenue. In order to maintain the smokescreen, people will be denied that right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said to the hon. Member for Beckenham, who is not in her place at the moment, I do not accept any such scenario. The hon. Gentleman is rehearsing arguments that were made on Second Reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Canterbury made some specific and important points in response to an intervention by the hon. Member for Northavon about the scope of the amendments. Lone parents in employment and couples who are both in employment will receive payment in their pay packets. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton also made that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Canterbury mentioned insolvency. The tax credit is not at risk. The Inland Revenue will make direct payments in insolvency cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Inland Revenue pays money to an employer who goes bust—a likely scenario—will it make a second payment to the employee, or will the employee have to recover the money from the employer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, many different situations will arise but the tax credit will not be at risk. The Inland Revenue will make a direct payment and it will sort out the problem with employers who do not pay as instructed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Canterbury rightly asked about privacy. I understand his concern. Employers and others who handle personal data are under a common law duty to protect that information from unauthorised persons. They are also required under the Data Protection Act 1998 to preserve an employee's personal details. It is a private matter between employer and employee if employers treat tax credits like pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members asked about discrimination against those in receipt of tax credit. They decided that the protection afforded to employees would be difficult to provide. I have heard that argument used in all debates on employment law, whether they were proposed by the Labour party or by others. Their arguments have no weight or merit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Webb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unless the amendments are accepted, lone parents will have no choice. They wil not be allowed to exercise their preference for direct payments because the Government want to teach them the lesson that work pays.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0419">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>111</span>
That is what the Minister said. Surely lone parents can be treated as adults. They do not have to be taught a lesson by the Government. They should be allowed to express their preferences. Is not that less patronising?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a great regard for the hon. Gentleman and for his expertise in this matter, but he is completely wrong. I am saying no such thing. The Governments are so committed to the Bill because it reinforces the connection with work. We are not being patronising; we are saying that work is important for people's dignity. That is what the Bill addresses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 15 would give a new choice of payment method to lone parents—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Financial Secretary has been very courteous in giving way. She has not dealt with my point about giving unscrupulous employers a considerable lever over employees. Several bodies, including the Chartered Institute of Taxation, made it clear that the regulations placed no obligation on an employer to make a working families tax credit payment when no other payments were due. What will happen in an industrial dispute involving an individual? That is different from the subject that the House will consider later today—the trade unions barons. In this context, we care about individuals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am shocked that the hon. Gentleman is already in retreat. I was about to leave the Committee when we adjourned for lunch—not one second before, Mrs. Dunwoody, I assure you—to break the news to the waiting world of the hon. Gentleman's conversation. Alas, I see that he has reneged already.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about my other point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg your pardon, Mrs. Dunwoody. What has become of me?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman made a sedentary intervention, and I would not dream of answering it. If he had waited one second longer, I would have told him that in an industrial dispute that covered an entire pay period, the Revenue will pay the tax credit direct—the employee will not miss out on a tax credit payment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Inland Revenue booklet, which I shall not quote, makes it clear that during a pay dispute, the employer—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Perhaps I have misled the Committee. I am sure that Committee members accept that I do not want large chunks of other people's briefings to be read on to the record. We are here to examine the Bill line by line. If the hon. Gentleman would identify the document from which he wishes to quote—it is perfectly legitimate for him to do so—he would ensure that the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>112</span>
Committee's record reflects what happened. That may be embarrassing from time to time, but we just have to live with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful. The Inland Revenue document, "Working Families Tax Credit and Disabled Person's Tax Credit", contains instructions about how the system will work in practice. It says that during a trade dispute, when employers have no obligation to pay a tax credit after one pay period if they are not also paying a wage, employers will have to give an employee a certificate of payment that shows the amount of tax credits that were being paid. The employee would take that certificate to the Inland Revenue, on receipt of which the employee would continue directly to receive working families tax credit. However, that requires the employer to give the employee that certificate. The point that was made by my hon. Friends the Members for Brentwood and Ongar and for Canterbury was that if there is acrimony between the employee and the employer during a dispute, it may not be possible to obtain those certificates. That is the key purpose of the amendment—it would allow claims to be made directly even if a dispute was anticipated. How will the Financial Secretary deal with that problem, and the hardships that would be involved?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very easily. In the very rare cases that the hon. Gentleman outlines, it will be for the Revenue to resolve the matter—that is the normal practice. I am pleased that Conservative Members noticed the care with which we tackled the matter and the thought that we put into the ways in which payment could be made in such circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 15 would give a new choice of payment methods to lone parents alone. My right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) expressed concern on Second Reading about how vulnerable that group might be to pressures placed on them by employers. Despite those concerns, we believe that the protection contained later in the Bill, coupled with the procedures that the Inland Revenue will be putting in place—I referred to that earlier—to deal with non-compliant employers and safeguard the right of employees to receive tax credits, will amply protect the interests of that group in the same way as it will secure the working of the new system as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that reassures the Committee, but if the hon. Member for Canterbury does not see fit to withdraw his amendment, I shall invite the Committee to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not persuaded and I may raise the matter on Report, but I shall ask the Committee's leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Webb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I very much share the lack of conviction of the hon. Member for Canterbury at the Government's responses. We have discussed three substantive issues and

on each I have been left less convinced than I was at the beginning. I consider myself a fundamentally reasonable man who is swayed by argument and I have an alarming tendency to believe the last person I heard. That is probably why I am in the party I am— 	<i>[Laughter.]</i> However, on this occasion that tendency has not occurred and the force of argument has been with those who oppose the Bill.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. May I make it clear that if we have a full debate in the Committee, hon.

That is normal procedure and I want to make that clear. Withdrawing an amendment does not ensure that the subject will be debated again.

For example, she stressed the procedures that employers must go through when insolvency is threatened and how the Inland Revenue would handle that. She also referred to the safeguards that will protect employees form the sort of intimidation that has been mentioned. We hope to be able to consider those matters further if we are so lucky as to persuade Madam Speaker to return to them.

I shall be reasonably brief. The reason for the amendment arises from an intervention by the hon. Member for Northavon to whom I pay tribute and in the coming weeks, I shall try to ensure that I am the last person to speak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment refers to the level at which the tax credit should end. We have criticised parliamentary answers from the Paymaster General concerning the level
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>114</span>
of £38,000 and I am putting my money where my mouth is. We believe that the tax credit should not be paid to individuals whose income exceeds the top rate of tax. Moreover, it should not be paid to couples whose joint income exceeds the higher rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You have castigated us for quoting too much, Mrs. Dunwoody. What I am about is not contained in any of the Government or Opposition briefings. There should be a degree of honesty about the amendment. It is true that, if it were applied to family credit, certain people would lose out. I shall give a typical example. Let us imagine that the doors at the far end of the room crash open and the entire von Trapp family enters, along with their child minder. If they were in receipt of family credit, they would undoubtedly be worse off under the amendment. Families with seven children who are top-rate taxpayers—as, I suspect, the von Trapp family was—would undoubtedly lose out. Our contention is that, under the amendment, the von Trapps would have had their chips.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In pursuing their social policies, the Government are determining the top rate of tax and the income of families according to that top rate. Families will automatically move up or down according to those policies. We are concerned that the much-vaunted £1.5 billion is being frittered away by moving the working families tax credit further up the social and economic ladder. Instead, those sums should be concentrated on people at the bottom end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Worries have been expressed to us about how the taper will operate and how the working families tax credit will operate against other benefits, particularly housing benefits. Those at the lower end of the income sale will not really benefit; materially, there will be virtually no effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are saying two contradictory things about those at the top end of the scale whom, like the von Trapps, the amendment seeks to exclude from the provision. They claim that the new system is much more generous because it extends higher up the social and economic ladder, but the Chancellor of the Exchequer has said that child benefit will be taxed. So, what the Government attempt to give with one hand, they will take away with the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would deal with the rather silly examples of the payment of tax credit to people on £37,000 or £38,000 a year with five children, and would ensure that the money is concentrated on those families at the lower end of the income scale who are most in need.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Webb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sympathise with the spirit of the amendment and I shall offer a couple of brief reflections on it. Clearly, it is absurd that a reform that seeks to make work pay should apply to higher-rate taxpayers. If higher-rate taxpayers' jobs are not worth doing, we all might as well go home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, I am not convinced that the amendment is the right way to tackle the problem. It would prevent the payment of the tax credit not only to individuals who have incomes above the higher rate threshold, but,
	<br><blockquote><p>"to couples who have a joint income in excess of the income at which the higher rate of tax would be payable by an individual."</p></blockquote>
I assume that the amendment would therefore include couples who each earn £16,000.

Given that they introduced it, the Conservatives presumably accept the principle of independent taxation. If one accepts that principle, it seems rather hard to penalise a couple where both partners earn £16,000 and effectively treat them as though they were a couple.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the point that there is an overlap between the benefits system, which examines family income as a unit, and the tax system, which correctly taxes people on an individual basis. The amendment encapsulates the combination of the two systems. It is drafted to prevent unfairness creeping in to the application of an upper limit on the income that can be earned before claiming the working families tax credit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Webb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The anomalies described by the hon. Gentleman apply under independent taxation. A couple with one earner on £30,000 will pay a lot more tax than a couple with two earners on £15,000. If that situation is anomalous under the independent taxation regime that the hon. Gentleman apparently supports, it is just as anomalous under the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a more substantive reason for disagreeing with the amendment—it raises the targeting of the working families tax credit. It extends to higher-rate taxpayers partly because the taper is applied higher up the income scale, but the main reason in the taper itself. The taper is lower—55 per cent., not 70 per cent., so it stretches all the way up. We have not yet heard the Government argue convincingly that tapers matter. Clearly, combined marginal tax rates such as 99 per cent. or 96 per cent. are an absurdity and their removal is welcome, but the result will be that lots of people will lose 50p or 60p in the pound. No empirical evidence or research has shown that that is, on balance, beneficial in terms of work incentives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, the few who no longer pay 90 per cent. might be willing to work slightly harder, but what about the many—the Government speak about governing not for the few but for the many—who will now lose 60p in the pound or more. What research has been done to show whether those people's work incentives will be adversely affected?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a strong case, but the position is much worse than he suggests. The interaction with other benefits will mean that the marginal rate for those in receipt of WFTC and housing benefit, even assuming that they are not in receipt of council tax benefit, will be 89 per cent. Very high marginal rates of tax and benefit withdrawal will extend well up the income scale.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Webb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not unduly worried by that, as relatively few people who are well up the income scale rent. Certainly there will be relatively few who, once they
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>116</span>
have received the tax credit, will not be floated off housing benefit altogether. The hon. Gentleman will find that the number of people who are in receipt of both benefits at the same time is fairly small and fairly concentrated, and not at the high income levels that we are discussing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That merely affects people at the lower end of the scale. One of our principal concerns in drafting the amendment was to ensure that such resources as are available go further down the income scale.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Webb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that interpretation of the gesture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My impression is that many people who are in receipt of means-tested benefits would not know a taper if—for want of a better phrase—it hit them in the face. They do not know whether the taper is 70 per cent., 55 per cent., or anything about it. They know what they are getting now, and perhaps if they get a better job they will see—six months later when the necessary adjustments have been made—that they did not receive much net benefit. The evidence that tapers influence people's behaviour is negligible. Can the Financial Secretary cite academic studies showing that by changing tapers people change their labour market decisions—or even that they understand what a taper is? I would be surprised to hear about them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Imposing an arbitrary cut-off point, which would provide help if the income was a penny below the line, but none if it was a penny above, is not the way to solve the problem of higher rate taxpayers. Such a system would create discontinuity, which is undesirable. A better way would be to maintain the taper at 70 per cent.—this is a slighly radical proposal—and spend the extra money on higher credits. Therefore, the credit would extend a little further in terms of distribution, but not into the income ranges that we have discussed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes some valid points about the taper. Has he read the evidence given by Patrick Minford to the Social Security Select Committee? He said that by bringing an additional 750,000 people into higher marginal tax rates of between 50 per cent. and 60 per cent., the Government, in trying to deal with the unemployment trap, have worsened the poverty trap. They have reduced the incentives for people to improve their job skills and promotion prospects, which cannot be measured but will have an effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
