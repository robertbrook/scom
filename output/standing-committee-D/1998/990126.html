	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Mental Health Act 1983 Code of Practice.</p></blockquote>
It is a pleasure, Mr. Cook, to serve in a Committee under your Chairmanship. I hope that our proceedings this morning will be enlightening and interesting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The code of practice does not have statutory force, but it has a powerful influence on the practice followed in our mental health institutions. Because the code can be cited in legal actions—for example in cases relating to claimed negligence—it is very important. The Opposition understand the difficulties of achieving a balance between the interests of patients, the public and the professionals involved in treating patients. We are not attempting to take a sledgehammer to the code of practice, which in many respects is widely welcomed by all those concerned with mental health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the code has provoked some concerns. The Opposition's duty is to subject such measures to proper scrutiny. Our intention today is not necessarily hostile to the Government or their proposals but stems from the belief that, where the rights of vulnerable people are affected, it is right and proper that Parliament should scrutinise the regulations and that it would be failing in its duty if it did not probe the intentions behind the code as well as its practical implications and potential weaknesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are especially concerned about the consultation process. The code of practice has been out to consultation for more than two years. One might think that all interested parties would therefore have had adequate opportunity to present their views, but in two important areas—the provisions for random searching of patients and visits by children to patients in psychiatric hospitals—the code of practice incorporates wording inserted late in the proceedings, and certainly after representations had been made by a number of interested and qualified bodies. That betrays an arrogance in the Government's approach to this matter that we have detected elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that, until now, the code of practice with its regular revisions has always been accepted as a consensus document, arrived at after widespread consultation. It is therefore unfortunate that at least two of the major institutions representing patients' interests are now on the warpath over the insertion of provisions after the consultation procedure. I shall deal with that more fully later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
There have been many stylistic changes in the code and its organisation. Chapter 1 now helpfully summarises the guiding principles underlying the code. Perhaps less helpfully for a Government who insist that there is no rationing in the national health service, the first page of chapter 1 also contains the most explicit statement on rationing in the NHS that I have seen. It states that patients assessed for admission should
	<br><blockquote><p>"have their needs taken fully into account, though it is recognised that, within available resources, it may not always be practicable to meet them in full".</p></blockquote>
That may seem an uncontroversial, rather commonsense statement, but it sits uncomfortably with that made in the House before Christmas by the Minister for Public Health, the right hon. Member for Dulwich and West Norwood (Ms Jowell), who told my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe) that there was no rationing in the national health service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of rationing interfaces with that of compulsory treatment orders, to which I shall return. In a regime where the most appropriate drugs are rationed—for example, the use of atypical anti-psychotic drugs for the treatment of schizophrenia—it is important that all available best treatments are offered to patients, regardless of cost, before comtemplating the constraining of their freedom through measures such as compulsory treatment orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An explicit debate is needed on rationing, not just in mental health but throughout the NHS. Nevertheless, practising mental health clinicians, with whom I spoke in preparation for this morning's debate, expressed the deep-rooted feeling—of which I am sure the Minister is aware—that mental health is a Cinderella service, notwithstanding the Government's reassuring words. A director of one mental health trust said that we should contrast the provision of expensive treatment for HIV with less expensive but heavily rationed treatments for schizophrenia. Such contrasts inevitably lead those working in mental health to feel that, in some respects, they are bearing the brunt of rationing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also concerned by the absence of proposals for a new mental health Act. Before the general election, it was widely understood across the mental health community that a Labour Government would be committed to introducing a new mental health Act during this Parliament. It now appears that one will not be introduced, although I understand that consultations are taking place. This code and the new guidance that it offers will therefore be regarded, to some extent, as a short-term substitute for a new mental health Act. Clinicians and practitioners will look to the code for guidance on recent areas of concern, such as the Bournewood judgment, to which I shall refer in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before dealing with the substantive issues raised by the code, I wish to make two minor, technical points about its drafting. In future, when producing such documents—this one is 110 pages long—will the Minister ensure that the Department produces a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0036">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
highlighted version, with any changes printed in italics? That is common practice in, for example, the legal profession, where draft contracts are passed back and forth between parties. Highlighting makes it easier for someone who is not familiar with the detail of the documents to locate important changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to raise another minor point. Can the Minister clarify what paragraph 20.9 is intended to say? A typographical error in the first line of that paragraph makes it impossible to understand its precise meaning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addressing the substance of the code, I shall attempt to adopt a chronological approach, although not all the issues that I wish to raise fall neatly into the code's existing chapter structure. The first matter relates to compliant incapacitated patients. Those are not voluntary patients; they have no mental capacity to consent to treatment, but are deemed from their behaviour not have to dissented from treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue was highlighted by the Bournewood judgment. The Minister will know—at least I hope that he knows—that I have a personal interest in the Bournewood judgment because the Bournewood community and mental health trust provides services in my constituency. Patient "L", on whose behalf the legal action was taken, is my constituent. The judgment relates to the scope of section 131 of the Mental Health Act 1983. When the judgment was received, the Minister's predecessor, the hon. Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng), expressed concern that it could result in a large number of patients who are currently admitted informally having to be subject to formal admission processes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To put that into context, at any one time about 13,000 patients in the system are formally detained. If the initial judgment in the Bournewood case, which stated that those patients would have to be formally detained, was allowed to stand, it was estimated that figure would rise to approximately 35,000—a startling increase. It would have added 48,000 admissions a year to the number that had to be processed. It is clear that that would have created a substantial increase in the work load of people working in the mental health sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case went to the House of Lords, which, much to the relief, I suspect, of Ministers, determined that informal admission procedures could continue and that it would not be necessary formally to admit all those patients. However, the concerns that were raised in the case of patient "L" have not gone away. The gist of what Lord Justice Steyn said at the time of the judgment, which he considered carefully, was that those patients who would continue to be admitted informally would continue not to benefit from any of the protections provided by the Mental Health Act 1983. In particular, they would continue not to have the right to apply for, or to be automatically referred to, mental health review tribunals in accordance with the provisions of part V of that Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord Steyn said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Given that such patients are diagnostically indistinguishable from compulsory patients, there is no reason to withhold the specific and effective protections of the Act of 1983 from a large class of vulnerable mentally incapacitated individuals. Their
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
moral right to be treated with dignity requires nothing less. The only comfort is that counsel for the Secretary of State has assured the House that reform of the law is under active consideration."</p></blockquote>
It will be some years before a revised mental health Act is introduced, and we had hoped that the Government might have sought to deal in the code of practice with the matters that were raised in the Bournewood judgment. That would ensure that patients who are informally detained benefit—as far as is practicable—from the rights that formally detained patients have under the Mental Health Act 1983.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Chapter 10 of the code of practice relates to the powers of the police to remove people to a place of safety. I have no difficulties in theory with that chapter, but I want to raise some practical difficulties, which underlie a problem that runs throughout the code, namely, that it relates to an ideal world. The code raises matters without referring to the real constraints that practitioners face on the ground. Reality is different from the situation in the code.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 10.5 suggests that hospitals should be preferred over police stations as a place of safety. No one would disagree that that is an ideal situation—patients should be taken to hospitals rather than police stations as a place of safety. However, practitioners with whom I have spoken are concerned about the resource implications of delivering straight to a hospital patients who have hitherto been kept in a police station as a place of safety. They are also worried about the associated diversion from treatments of patients who are already in that hospital. Will further resources be made available to hospitals to cope with that additional work load?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That leads me on to paragraph 10.3, which refers to the responsibility of police officers to "remain in attendance", where appropriate, and where the protection of others so requires,
	<br><blockquote><p>"when the patient is taken to a place of safety other than a police station".</p></blockquote>
Once again, that clearly has substantial resource implications. When a patient is taken to a police station, police officers are, by definition, available if needed. If the patient is taken to a hospital, good practice suggests, and the code recommends, that where it is appropriate—for reasons relating to the protection of the safety of any persons—police officers should remain in attendance. We all know the truth—the police are over-stretched and under-resourced. I am told by clinicians that, in practice, police officers normally remain at the hospital for only a short time—and one can fully appreciate their reasons for doing so. Has the Home Secretary had discussions about making available additional resources that will help the police to discharge the duties placed on them by paragraph 10.3? If the code gives guidance that is theoretical and cannot be implemented in practice, that could leave a damaging lacuna. If the guidance in the code cannot be implemented, clinicians will have to fall back on their own ingenuity, which is potentially dangerous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Chapter 14 of the previous code stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"all patients should be given, throughout their stay in hospital, as much information as possible about their care and treatment".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0037">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
That seems rather unexceptional—it represents good practice, and respects the dignity of patients and their right to be informed. Those words were removed from chapter 14 of the present code, and I should appreciate the Minister's explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraphs 2, 9 and 10 of chapter 16 deal with treatment and the requirement for consent or a second opinion, in the context of electro-convulsive therapy. Various groups expected the code of practice to incorporate, by reference, the Royal College of Psychiatrists' guidelines on the administration of electro-convulsive therapy. Its 1997 report found that there was poor practice in two thirds of ECT clinics, including badly trained staff and the use of obsolete equipment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are serious concerns about electro-convulsive therapy. It is a contraversial treatment and there is not universal agreement on its effectiveness. Policy varies widely across health authorities, and it would appear that it is not always used as a genuine last-resort treatment. At present, for a patient to receive ECT, either the patient must consent or there must be a second clinical opinion. That is to say, the treatment is administered under section 58 of the Mental Health Act 1983. Will the Minister comment on suggestions that it should be moved from section 58 to section 57 of the Act, which provides that both consent and a second opinion are required before ECT can be given? Will he explain what the involvement of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence will be establishing uniformity in mental health treatment generally and ECT in particular?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Chapter 19 deals with the management of difficult patients. May I cite a small example of a creeping use of politically correct and, in some cases, wholly meaningless language in this document? I refer Committee members to paragraph 19.12, which refers to restraint of patients. An otherwise sensible paragraph concludes by saying that any restraint used should be
	<br><blockquote><p>"sensitive to gender and race issues."</p></blockquote>
I understand how physical restraint of a patient might need to be sensitive to gender issues, but I have racked my brains to think how physical restraint could be sensitive to race issues or what race issues it could raise. Is there any substance to that, or is it simply a nod in the direction of political correctness?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a more substantive point, chapter 19 contains no reference to the use of CS spray. The Minister will be aware that CS spray is increasingly used by the police, either when conveying difficult mentally ill patients to hospital or when they are called into psychiatric hospitals to deal with management problems. Serious questions remain over the interaction of CS gas with psychoactive medication. I am not necessarily critical of the use of CS gas; I understand that it is an important tool in the armoury of the police. I know, from talking to police officers, how difficult and frightening it can be to have to restrain seriously mentally ill patients, but given that this issue raises
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
such widespread public concern, I am astonished that the code of practice contains no reference to the use of CS gas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also want to address the question of mixed wards and sexual harassment. The Minister will know that my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis) has run something of a campaign on the issue of mixed wards in psychiatric hospitals. I was surprised when I looked at the code to find only one passing reference to the segregation of patients by gender, and certainly nothing that could be described as prescriptive guidance to that effect. That contrasts sharply with the Secretary of State's apparently strong line on this issue in responding to my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, East when he has raised these matters in the House. Can the Minister explain why the code contains no clear guidance to trusts on phasing out mixed accommodation as soon as possible?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some hospitals have written policies on dealing with sexual harassment complaints and when to involve the police in such complaints, but, rightly or wrongly, there is a perception in the mental health community that not all such allegations from patients in psychiatric hospitals are treated with appropriate seriousness. Will the Minister consider whether all hospitals should be required to have a written policy on dealing with sexual harassment complaints and whether that should be made explicit in chapter 19?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to the two most controversial and important chapters of the code, chapters 25 and 26. Those chapters have caused most concern to the bodies interested in these matters, not least because that is where the consultation process has broken down most significantly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Chapter 25 deals with the powers to search patients. The code of practice permits all hospitals admitting patients under the Mental Health Act to search patients at random. This guidance, which appears to have resulted from a case relating to Broadmoor hospital, is outlined in paragraphs 2 and 3. What the Opposition and many outside object to is an apparent generalisation to all psychiatric hospitals of what is considered reasonable and appropriate in special hospitals. It can be argued that generalised search policies upset the therapeutic balance in a hospital, and the code does not appear to rule out the searching of patients admitted voluntarily. Will the Minister clarify that point?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The code of practice acknowledges that there is a conflict between the maintenance of a therapeutic environment and the maintenance of security in the hospital, but it also acknowledges that random searches are required only where patients have violent or criminal propensities. It therefore appears to recognise that the measure is suited only to special hospitals and it calls into question why the code appears to extend that to all psychiatric hospitals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wording in chapter 25.3,
	<br><blockquote><p>"The policy may extend to routine and random searching without cause",</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0038">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
is offensive to many people. Although it is understood that random searching may be required in some cases, to say that it should be "without cause" seems to invite entirely arbitrary searching, which can never be helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Chapter 26, which is probably the most controversial aspect of the code of practice, deals with visits by children to patients in psychiatric hospitals. The code of practice states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A visit by a child should only take place following a decision that such a visit would be in the child's best interests."</p></blockquote>
That mirrors the terminology of the Children Act 1989. We fully accept that the interests of the child must be paramount where there is any concern about the child's safety or security. However, the code of practice shifts the burden of proof. It makes the automatic assumption that all psychiatric patients are dangerous to children. It starts from the premise that no visits should be allowed unless a positive decision has been taken that such a visit would be in the child's best interests.

When this chapter went out for consultation, it did not include all the following—critical—words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A visit by a child should only take place following a decision that such a visit would be in the child's best interests. Decisions to allow such visits should be regularly reviewed."</p></blockquote>
Something that is so obviously controversial should not have been inserted into the code of practice at the last minute after lengthy and widespread consultation. Clearly, the wording follows the Secretary of State's guidance on high security special hospitals, which was issued in the light of the Ashworth case. We all accept the need for careful provisions to ensure that the terrible events that took place at Ashworth are not repeated, but that does not justify treating all patients in psychiatric hospitals in the same manner as patients who are in special hospitals because they are a danger to others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only about 15 per cent. of formal admissions to all psychiatric hospitals under the Mental Health Act are criminal sections, and they are usually admitted to special hospitals. It is highly inappropriate that the chapter should suggest that the remaining 85 per cent. of patients pose a risk to children. Indeed, the Prison Service rules for children's visits clearly state that account must be taken of the prisoner's background and offence when deciding whether a child's visit is appropriate. The code of practice does not give the same scope for considering the particular circumstances of the patient in question, such as the nature of his illness and his history. The code of practice discriminates unreasonably against mental health patients and puts them in a worse position than people who have been convicted of criminal offences and who are in prison subject to Prison Service rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also worth noting that this chapter gives no guidance on who should decide to permit the visit of a child or how the decision should be made. Giving such a large amount of discretion to individual hospitals and social workers is likely to lead to regional disparities and unfairness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
Should not the code of practice distinguish between special hospitals and other psychiatric units? Should not it be assumed in the case of the latter that there is no reason to start from the premise that children would be in danger by visiting a patient unless the patient's history—diagnosis and other surrounding circumstances—indicates that? Should not there be procedures for reviewing a decision not to allow visits to take place? The chapter presumes that visits will be allowed only in exceptional circumstances. Will the Minister deal with the concerns that the code's provisions may contravene article 8 of the European convention on human rights, which is mentioned in chapter 1 of the code? Article 8 states that everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, although that can be restricted on grounds of public safety or the prevention of crime. Many commentators doubt whether a blanket ban is consistent with article 8.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will be aware that the public and the press have expressed concerns recently about patients who suffer from personality disorders, and questions have been raised in the House about the admissibility of personality-disordered patients for treatment to psychiatric hospitals. How will the code deal with that topical and serious matter? What guidance does it offer to clinicians to help them to deal with the admissibility of personality-disordered patients? While the Minister is at it, will he also acknowledge the need for an open debate on that matter before we proceed with other measures, including the possibility of introducing renewable detention orders?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to have taken up so much of the Committee's time, Mr. Cook, but I hope that the Minister will deal with all the matters that I raised. I hope that he will deal not simply with the high-profile issues of searching and child visits, which have attracted much publicity, but with the less dramatic but equally important matters that I identified. It is our duty, on behalf of the vulnerable people whose lives will be affected by the code, to bring all those matters into the open and to air them in the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Evan Harris 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Oxford, West and Abingdon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must say how pleased I am to serve on this Committee under your chairmanship, Mr. Cook. I share some of the concerns raised by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond), but I hope to be more positive than he was about some of the changes that have been made in the code of practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome many of the changes that have been made in the code, including, for example, greater clarity in the role and functions of hospital managers in the discharge of patients. Concerns that were raised in the Glen Grant case and in the Huzzey case have been taken on board. Perhaps in contrast to the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, I also welcome explicit recognition of the fact that gender and race issues have to be considered in relation to the management of patients. In view of recent cases, it should not be hard for Committee members to appreciate why racial sensitivities must be borne in

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
mind in questions of restraint. It is appropriate to mention that matter explicitly in the guidelines, because they lead to professional and legal decisions about the appropriateness of care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also welcome the root-and-branch review of the Mental Health Act 1983 which the Government are undertaking. I share little of the hon. Gentleman's confusion about the Government's legislative intentions. I imagine that their review is based on a presumption that some changes in the legislation are needed, and I appreciate the fact that the Government have a crowded parliamentary agenda. However, in a meeting about 12 months ago I was disappointed when the Minister's predecessor said that he ruled out absolutely making any changes to the 1983 Act during this Parliament. I hope that the Government will keep an open mind on that matter, that the review will be full and that it will recognise the relevant matters that need to be discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the hon. Gentleman's concerns about late additions. I, too, noticed the remarkable statement in chapter 1 that people to whom the Act applies should
	<br><blockquote><p>"have their needs taken fully into account, though it is recognised that, within available resources, it may not always be practicable to meet them in full".</p></blockquote>
That is a welcome admission of a reality, but the Government do not necessarily support it. Indeed, they have repeatedly said that it is a reality that they inherited. The shortage of beds for mentally ill patients may not be as obvious to the media as the shortage of intensive care beds. Critically ill patients do not bear the stigma associated with mental illness. Unlike the mentally ill, they are rarely transferred to hospitals that are miles away from their families, although some cases have recently come to light.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The guidelines refer to the duties incumbent on other people, but the Government have a duty to ensure that mental health gets the recognition that it deserves and is no longer treated as a Cinderella specialty. They must also recognise the importance of bed numbers in local areas, so that mentally ill patients have the support that they need and families can visit them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have stated their ambition to put more resources into mental health and to establish frameworks that will raise the quality of care throughout the country. The matter is now urgent. Further resources must be provided for mental health so that the rationing to which chapter 1 refers is reduced as much as possible. Similar funding must also be provided for social services. Funding should not be taken from one area to provide for another, as has happened in my constituency. That would be a false economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where rationing occurs, it should be based on the ability to benefit from the treatment and related to the severity of the condition. Does the Minister agree that the decision to treat should not be based on the cause of the signs and symptoms at presentation? Other drugs—certainly, one other drug to which recent attention has been paid—have been rationed
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
according to cause rather than to the severity of the condition or the ability to benefit from the treatment. That is wrong and unethical practice. Where two patients with illnesses that have arisen from different causes might benefit equally from a particular treatment, I, as a doctor, would not be willing to decide who deserved treatment on the basis of the relative political correctness of the causes. The Minister must take this opportunity to make it clear that such things will not happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the comments of the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge on electro-convulsive therapy, and I shall not therefore detain the Committee by adding to them. I also agree with his comments about the use of CS gas. He made some important points in relation to the Bournewood case. Clearly, the House of Lords' ruling that overturned the Court of Appeal hearing relieved the Government of a large resourcing problem. I shall not comment on the merits of that ruling, but it highlighted whether patients who are mentally incapable of giving consent have the same level of protection as those who are formally detained under the Mental Health Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as I am aware, prisons constitute a different case. The physicians who were looking after a constituent of mine who was starving himself in prison found it extremely difficult to get him transferred to a hospital, despite the fact that he had become physically ill, simply because a psychiatrist deemed him not to be mentally ill at that point. The division of medical services between prisons and hospitals is a continuing problem and there is a considerable amount of mental illness in prisons. If prison medical services are brought under the NHS, the problem can be solved and consideration of the rights of the mentally ill in prisons can be brought up to scratch. Many hon. Members will be aware of cases in their constituencies that have raised concerns about the consideration awarded to mentally ill prisoners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also associate myself with what the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge said about personal searches. Although I shall not detain the Committee by adding to that, I should like to comment on one of his major concerns—the issue of child visits. The hon. Gentleman and I received some of the same briefings, and I am especially grateful for the information provided by MIND; Schizophrenia—A National Emergency, known as SANE; the National Schizophrenia Fellowship; and the Mental After Care Association, which were all worried about children's visits. Those organisations do not always concur; they often have different perspectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned not only about civil liberties and the rights and consideration of the interests of people detained, but about the stigma that continues to be attached to mentally ill patients. The media are obsessed with the more extreme cases of people who may be a danger to the general public, but it must be stressed time and again—Ministers do not do this enough in public—that that applies to only a small minority of mentally ill patients. According to the latest available research, the risk to the public has reduced despite the problems caused by the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0040">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
underfunding of community care. It is sad not only that the Secretary of State makes statements that cannot be supported by the evidence, but that such statements give rise to the stigma that community care has failed and that the public are at a greater risk. The inference in the code that all hospitals and mentally ill patients pose a threat to visiting children does nothing to detract from the impression given by comments in the media and by Ministers that the mentally ill pose a general threat to the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mental illness is widespread. The number of people who will encounter mental illness is shocking. If the proportion of people who will suffer from mental illness is applied to those who work in the House, we must accept that people around us will, have or are suffering from mental illness. It is vital—not only because of the numbers but because of the principle—that those people are protected as much as possible from the stigma and fear that surrounds mental health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wide terms of the chapter give rise to concern. It is entitled:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Visiting patients detained in hospital or registered mental nursing homes".</p></blockquote>
That takes the definition beyond special hospitals. However, paragraph 26.3 refers only to hospitals having written policies on the arrangements. The distinction is unclear because the title also refers to "registered mental nursing homes".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Organisations that work with the mentally ill have expressed concerns. The Mental After Care Association believes that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the blanket wording of the Code implies that all detained patients (including those not in a Special Hospital) are a risk to children."</p></blockquote>
Although it agrees that
	<br><blockquote><p>"all hospitals should have written guidelines on visits by children",</p></blockquote>
it believes that
	<br><blockquote><p>"there should be no automatic presumption of risk across all patients."</p></blockquote>
The Minister will know from a letter written by the Mental After Care Association on 6 January that'
	<br><blockquote><p>"patients' ability to maintain good family connections while in hospital is often a key element of their welfare and their responsiveness to treatment".</p></blockquote>
My limited experience of clinical practice in this area has shown me that that contact is vital. There is a concern that the need to have a presumption of no visits will lead to delays in a stretched health service and that those delays may occur at a critical time in a patient's care. The presumption of no visits before guidelines are followed and a decision is made will therefore not benefit patient care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other concerns are listed by SANE, which often does not take the same view as other organisations. In the guidance that I and other members of the Committee have received its adviser says that SANE does not believe that it would be appropriate to have that presumption of peril.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
The impression given to the media by Ministers' language is as important, if not more important, as the wording. It is therefore regrettable that the final paragraph of the Minister's answer on 19 January 1999 stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Code is drafted in wide terms to ensure that all visits by children are considered in this way …. However, where hospitals or units care for mentally disordered offenders or those patients with more severe forms of mental illness, policies on visiting will need to be more detailed and rigorously enforced."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 19 January 1999; Vol. 323, c.427.]</p></blockquote>
The sweeping generalisations and the presumption of peril mitigate against the need to ensure that the considerations of people with mental illness are dealt with equally. I urge the Minister to make an early statement in an attempt to destigmatise the mentally ill, but, broadly, I welcome many of the Government's policies and many of the changes in this guidance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Gunnell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Morley and Rothwell)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome the Government's work, but I agree with two points made by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge: it would be helpful if the revisions in the code of practice were highlighted. I introduced a private Member's Bill on electro-convulsive therapy in an attempt to make changes to the Mental Health Act. I was much less familiar with the code of practice, which I received only this morning, and it would have helped me if the changes had been highlighted, particularly in the section beginning on page 51, on capacity and consent to treatment and the section beginning on page 60, which deals with second opinion appointed doctors. I accept that highlighting a code of practice in time for a Committee takes a good deal of work, so I understand why it has not been done, but it would have been helpful to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge also referred to the 1997 report of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, which highlighted the RCP's concerns about the way in which ECT was administered. As the hon. Gentleman said, there was a question about the validity of the readings on machines. It is important that machines are calibrated accurately and that the exact dosage is known. The RCP was also concerned that the therapy should be administered by properly trained staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of consent is important, especially when treatment is given without consent, and my Bill sought to deal with that matter. Indeed, it proposed a change suggested by the hon. Gentleman—the transfer of ECT to section 57 of the Mental Health Act 1983. Clause 2(2) of my private Member's Bill proposed that a new subsection be introduced into that Act, and it stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Section 57 of this Act, insofar as it relates to electro-convulsive therapy, applies to any patient liable to be detained under this Act."</p></blockquote>
That Bill also proposed an annual review by the Mental Health Act Commission
	<br><blockquote><p>"of all medical facilities providing electro-convulsive therapy treatment".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0041">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
It stated that that commission should be satisfied with the ability of people who administer the treatment to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I introduced my private Member's Bill, I said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"At the time of the debate on what became the Mental Health Act 1983, the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), then the Secretary of State for Health, said that he had decided not to include ECT under treatments requiring both consent and a second opinion</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'but as experience is acquired, and if opinion changes, we shall be able to move it into the more serious … category.'—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 18 October 1982; Vol. 29, c. 86.].</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>My Bill would take us to the situation that the right hon. and learned Gentleman envisaged might be necessary. It would also ensure that ECT is carried out in safe circumstances and that the patient can be given ECT only if he or she has given informed consent and if a second opinion appointed doctor agrees, unless urgent treatment is judged necessary by the responsible medical officer."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 3 December 1997; Vol. 302, c. 394.]</p></blockquote>
I later allowed the Bill to fall, and I expressed my views on the matter to the Minister's predecessor, who is now the Minister of State, Home Department, the hon. Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng). He sent me a letter in response, which stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"When I met you … to listen to your concerns about electro convulsive therapy … I explained that I was minded to take some action with the Royal College as I was concerned to ensure best practice and was determined to drive up the quality of care and eradicate poor performance and practice.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>At that time I was not able to give an indication of the action that we were considering but I promised to let you know of any developments. I enclose for your information a copy of a letter that has been sent to all NHS Trusts and psychiatrists signed jointly by the Chief Medical Officer and the President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists."</p></blockquote>
That was the position in October 1998, and I have every reason to believe that the Minister now responsible for such matters has made progress. I look forward to hearing his account of the way in which he has done so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important matter, and I regret that I could not quote from the loads of letters that I received, after I introduced my private Member's Bill, from patients who underwent ECT. Many of the letters are heartrending, and they show the need for safeguards relating to the use of the treatment. I decided that it was not sensible to bring such letters with me or to read them to the Committee—all that was necessary today was that I state the case in general.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am confident that my hon. Friend the Minister will make progress and I look forward to hearing his response. Like the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon, I welcome the Government's review, but I want it to be incorporated in the legislation as soon as possible. I hope that the necessary processes of consultation and discussion will allow some changes to be made. In particular, I should like thought given to the matter of ECT patients who are treated without consent. I should also like the second opinion appointed doctor procedure to be followed where appropriate, as that would instil greater confidence in the system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Mr. John Hutton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a well-informed discussion about the Mental Health Act 1983 code of practice and I am grateful to all those who have contributed to the debate, particularly the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, who made some thoughtful remarks, and the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon. I shall deal specifically with the points made about ECT by my hon. Friend the Member for Morley and Rothwell (Mr. Gunnell).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge said in his opening remarks that, in preparing this new code of practice, we were trying to strike the right balance, and we are determined to do that. It is a difficult process. We do not underestimate that, but we are sure that the amended draft code of practice strikes the right balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regret, however, that the hon. Gentleman felt that we were being arrogant in developing the text. I reject that accusation absolutely and fundamentally. The consultation process on the code began in October 1996 and was based on advice from the Mental Health Act Commission, which has responsibility in that area. The initial consultation period ended in March 1997, during which time we received over 130 responses. The text, some of which the hon. Gentleman objects to, was amended to take into account many of those representations. We have tried to be as open as possible with all those who take an interest in this subject—patients, patients' representatives, social services departments and the voluntary organisations that are active in this field—to ensure that the new code provides the right balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge also said that the mental health service is a Cinderella service in the NHS, a view which I know is commonly held. We announced before Christmas the largest ever investment in mental health services since the inception of the NHS: nearly £700 million of additional resources will go into improving and supporting good mental health practice in the NHS over the next three years. That is a significant and positive investment in good mental health. The hon. Gentleman was right to imply that good mental health is fundamental to the well-being of our society. We strongly agree. That is why the Government are determined to modernise mental health services and provide those who want to use the NHS with a first-class service across the board. I am proud of our actions to implement that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have worked out that some 20 specific comments have been made about this draft code of practice. I shall try to answer each of those points today. We have only 55 minutes left, so I shall struggle—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Twenty-five minutes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh dear! That is worse than I thought. It might not be possible for me to respond to all the points. If hon. Members feel that I have not fully responded to their comments, I shall write to them to try to tidy up their concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0042">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge first referred to paragraph 20.9 of the draft code of practice. He is right: there is a typographical error there. It should read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The rmo may direct that the patient remains in custody while on leave of absence".</p></blockquote>
We shall make sure that the paragraph is amended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the hon. Members who have spoken, including my hon. Friend the Member for Morley and Rothwell, were concerned that the draft code of practice does not highlight, in the margins, the parts of the text that are now different. The reason is simple: the draft code has been substantially reordered and revised; it has been restructured in a number of fundamental ways. We therefore thought that it would be unhelpful, and probably impractical, to highlight individual textual changes in the margin. To try to meet those concerns, we have provided an explanatory memorandum at the beginning of the draft code, which highlights all the parts that have been changed. We are aware of the issue and have tried to respond to it in the most practical and feasible way, given the interest in the amended code.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge also referred to information to patients and was sorry that the proposed code did not repeat the earlier recommendation that information to patients and quality of information should be a priority. We have simply re-ordered the layout of the code, so that information is now dealt with in paragraph 11 of chapter 1, the chapter which sets out the general principles underlying the code. Therefore, there is no truth in the hon. Gentleman's implied concern that we were removing from the code the necessity for the patient to be kept as up to date as possible with all the relevant information about his or her treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All hon. Gentleman's referred to ECT. I know that there are strong feelings and sensitivities on ECT, which we want to try to respond to. My hon. Friend the Member for Morley and Rothwell was right to say in his short but well-informed remarks that in September 1998 the chief medical officer, together with Bob Kendell, the president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, wrote to all NHS hospital trusts to remind them of the need to make sure that its guidance on ECT practice and procedure was observed at all times. We are following that guidance closely and shall continue to do so, but we are taking action in the NHS to ensure that that best practice is spread as widely as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. Gentlemen said that the subject of ECT should be repositioned in the Mental Health Act. As I am sure all hon. Members know, a root-and-branch review of the Mental Health Act is taking place, led by Professor Genevra Richardson, and it will look at that part of the Act. We await Professor Richardson's recommendations with keen interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Runnymede and Weybridge and for Oxford, West and Abingdon were disappointed that there will be no mental health legislation in this Parliament. It is difficult, two years into a Parliament, to predict what will be in the Queen's Speech in year four or five, and I shall not try
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
to do so today. However, we should very much like to have a mental health bill in this Session. That is the timescale that we hope to work to, and we expect to go out to consultation on Professor Richardson's recommendations later in the year. Clearly, I have no absolute control—I wish I had—over the parliamentary timetable; that is for others to decide, but the department is anxious to press ahead with that work and see what Professor Richardson can present to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge referred to chapter 10 and assessment in police stations. Assessment in a police station requires both health and social care staff to attend, which diverts resources more than if the assessment takes place on hospital premises. We are aware of the issues, and this is a subject for consideration by the scoping group. However, the problems of police officers and the drain on resources are not new: they have been recurrent issues and we are looking at them closely. Ultimately, they are for the chief constables to decide, and it would be inappropriate in a code of practice that explains the operation of the Mental Health Act to deal with those wider resource issues. The hon. Gentleman's comment undermines some of the good points that he made. He has misunderstood the purpose of the code of practice and the extent to which it can influence or change other key policies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point that I was trying to make is that running through the code is the sense that it is set in an ideal world. Clinicians have told us that the restraints under which they operate make many of the recommendations fantasy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I agree with the hon. Gentleman. The code is realistic and sensible. Of course we had to recognise the reality of clinical practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman welcomed the "rationing" reference in the code of practice as though it was something new. He is wrong. It is not new. It was contained in paragraph 1.3 of the previous code of practice. We want the code to reflect reality and to provide practical advice to all those responsible for providing mental care. We strongly believe, partly because of the consultation exercise but also because of our awareness of what is going on, that the code of practice properly and fully does that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman and, I think, the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon, referred to the use of CS spray. The Bethlem and Maudsley national health service trust recently carried out a survey into the use of CS spray on people with mental health problems, which was published last August in 	<i>Mental Health Care.</i> The Royal College of Psychiatrists has been approached by the Association of Chief Police Officers' sub-committee on self-defence, as well as by the authors of the Maudsley research, to provide further guidance and help. The aim of the meeting is to discuss the use of CS spray on people with mental health problems and to establish where new guidelines
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0043">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
are needed. Guidance has not yet been issued by the Royal College, but it is obviously an on-going concern which we take very seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also mentioned mixed-sex hospital accommodation. He will know that the Government are committed to getting rid of mixed-sex accommodation. No new mixed-sex wards will be approved. We expect almost all health authorities to have eliminated mixed-sex accommodation by 2002.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I comment on other issues raised in the debate, it might be appropriate for me to refer more generally to the code of practice and to respond to the issue of child visits, which worried hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. It might be helpful if I briefly recount the background to the code, its purpose and how we arrived at today's draft code.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 118 of the Act states that the Secretary of State shall prepare, and from time to time revise, a code of practice for the guidance of all health and social services professionals and managers in relation to the use of the Mental Health Act. Section 118 also requires that relevant bodies be consulted on proposed revisions to the code before it is issued, and that the Secretary of State shall lay the code before Parliament for 40 days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In accordance with section 118, this version of the code has been subject to extensive consultation. We received more than 130 responses from health and local authorities, NHS trusts, community health councils, voluntary organisations, the legal profession, the Royal College of Psychiatrists and the Royal College of Nursing. Those responses were considered by officials in my Department and by the Mental Health Act Commission, who have a responsibility to monitor the effective operation of the Mental Health Act. Subsequent amendments to the text of the code were made in the light of those responses, including the changes made to child visits, before it was laid before the House in December. Both sides of the Committee would probably agree that a new version of the code is long overdue. It was last revised in 1993.

The purpose of the current revision is to update guidance in the code to reflect relevant developments in case law—in particular the Bournewood judgment and the judicial review of the search policy at Broadmoor; to reflect further amendments to the Mental Health Act and other relevant legislation; and to reflect changes in terminology and developments in practice over the past five years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Act does not impose a legal duty to comply with the code, but failure to follow it can and has been referred to in legal proceedings. Guidance in the code is a powerful lever in ensuring high quality and consistent practice in mental health service provision. We have spent more than two years revising the code to ensure that it is workable and that it accurately reflects the legal responsibilities outlined in the Mental Health Act, which have recently been clarified in substantial case law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
In addition to changes in specific guidance, the code has been substantially reworded and reordered for clarity's sake. The general principles that were previously repeated in several places throughout the code have been drawn together in chapter 1. That provides the background against which the rest of the guidance in the code can be read.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not read out all of the six general principles contained in the draft code, but I should point out that they lay a solid foundation for the principal recommendations contained in the code itself. The six principles are extremely important and should be considered in the context of all patients who receive treatment for mental disorder. Much of the guidance in the code is therefore relevant to the treatment and care of both formal and informal patients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the beginning of the new code, we have also included a section setting out the key elements of the care programme approach that should underpin the care of all patients with mental disorders, whether they are detained in hospital or receiving after-care in the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The essential elements of the care programme approach include a thorough assessment of health and social care needs, the provision of a key worker to coordinate care, a robust care plan and a regular review of the plan. Those principles are widely supported, are congruent with sound health and social care practice, and are reiterated in the Government's strategy document entitled, "Modernising mental health services".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are consulting key interest groups about harmonising and streamlining the care programme approach and care management processes, in order to retain good practice and to develop and revise where necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also taken care in chapter 1 to reinforce the importance of ensuring effective communication between staff and patients. Patients with mental disorders are particularly vulnerable: they may lack insight into their condition or be unable to make decisions for themselves. We have stressed the need for staff to have access to specialist help—including, where necessary, interpreters—so that they can communicate effectively with patients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless it is in the public interest for information to be shared, all clinicians have a clear duty of confidence towards their patients. In the spirit of the victim's charter, the code includes new guidance on the sharing of information with the victims of mentally disordered offenders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the comments made by the hon. Members for Runnymede and Weybridge and for Oxford West and Abingdon about the Bournewood case, it may help the Committee if I give some examples of the significant new guidance contained in the code. Paragraphs 2.7 and 2.8, to which the hon. Gentleman's referred, clarify the definition of an informal patient. That clarification has been included in the light of the House of Lords judgment in the Bournewood case. Guidance is given on the factors that should be considered in the case of a mentally incapacitated patient who does not object to being admitted. Attention is also drawn to

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
the need for such a patient's clinical and social care requirements to be considered on assessment, for the patient's views and feelings to be ascertained as far as possible, and for the views of the patient's immediate relatives and carers to be sought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
References to informal patients and their capacity, and the question of consideration of formal detention under the Act, are included throughout the rest of the code. For example, chapter 19 refers to patients who present particular management problems. Chapter 3 contains much new guidance on court reports and aims to ensure a more consistent approach to the compiling of reports, which will ensure a more appropriate outcome for the mentally disordered offender.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The guidance on personal searches given in chapter 25 has been substantially revised to take account of the judicial review—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will wait a moment, I shall respond to the concerns he has raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The guidance on personal searches given in chapter 25 has been substantially revised to take account of the judicial review of searching policy at Broadmoor hospital. We must understand the importance of protecting staff and other patients. In that respect, clinicians need to be vigilant. There is disturbing evidence of patients bringing guns and knives into hospitals, so we must remain alert and ever vigilant. Of course, we should not forget that there are violent patients in local NHS services. Moreover, there is the problem of the increased use of drugs in some units.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before he leaves the Bournewood case, can the Minister tell us why the code has not been used to extend to informally detained patients those protections that the Mental Health Act currently extends to formally detained patients, particularly the right to review?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a very technical question, to which I shall give some thought. We must not lose sight of the fact that we are discussing patients who are not detained under the Mental Health Act 1983. If the hon. Gentleman is patient with me, I shall respond to his question more fully in correspondence. The question of searching applies across the NHS—it is not simply a question of high-security hospitals, as the hon. Gentleman seemed to imply. Paragraph 25.1 makes it clear that the policy applies not only to those patients who are detained under the 1983 Act. I hope that that at least partly deals with his concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several Committee members discussed child visits, and I am aware that this matter has caused some concern. I must place on record the fact that the text of the draft copy was changed, partly because of representations that we received from social services departments and other childcare organisations, which wanted an explicit reference in the code of practice to the child's best interests. It is important to include such a reference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
I responded to many of the questions that the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon asked about child visits in the written answer to which he referred. That answer contained a precise response to many of the questions that he asked, including, for example, who will take the relevant decision. The hon. Gentleman was not sure whether proposals about child visits applied to registered mental nursing homes because, as he said, the text refers only to hospitals. He will be aware that the term "registered mental nursing homes" is used to describe private sector hospitals, which admit patients who are detained under the 1983 Act. Many of those hospitals treat patients in the private sector. So, yes, the policy of child visits will apply to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must also put on record the fact that mentally ill people who are potentially violent and who might cause distress to children by their unusual or odd behaviour are not only found in special hospitals. I must make it clear that we shall supplement the code's guidance for the benefit of NHS trusts and hospitals, the private sector and special hospitals. We shall send them specific directions about how policies on child visiting should be developed. With respect to the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, the problems are not simply in high-security and special hospitals. They apply, I am afraid, across the board, and we must be careful about how we proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must dispel one myth to which the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon and for Runnymede and Weybridge both succumbed: we will not impose a blanket ban. The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon used that phrase—I took a note of it while he was speaking. He referred to the fact that the new code of practice somehow implied that there was a blanket ban on child visits, but that is not the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our concern stems from the fact that the code states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A visit by a child should only take place following a decision that such a visit would be in the child's best interests."</p></blockquote>
That is a positive test. Following a review of the individual circumstances, it might be determined that a child is in no danger and at no risk through making such a visit, but that is not sufficient to pass the test. It will have to be determined that the visit is in the child's best interests, and that positive test is a very tough hurdle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the code is right, and that the test is as it should be. We consulted widely on that matter, and I know that there are strong dissenting views. The wording that we use takes into account the views of social services departments and of national childcare organisations. I must make it clear to the hon. Members for Runnymede and Weybridge and for Oxford, West and Abingdon that we shall supplement the code's recommendations with guidance on how to implement the policies, which will help hospitals, including high-security hospitals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not trying to stigmatise people who suffer from mental health problems—that is not on the Government's agenda, and we refute strongly the suggestion that that lies behind the new guidance
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0045">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
about child visiting policies. That suggestion is far from the truth. The strategy that we are trying to pursue is to raise awareness about mental health issues in our society, to develop the right response and to tackle mental health problems when they occur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon was right when he said that mental health problems were widespread—as I am sure he is aware, they are more common than asthma. We want policies that will respond to the needs of those who suffer at some point in their lives from mental health problems. We believe that our general thrust in modernising mental health service policies is the right one. On child visiting, we believe strongly that this is the right way to protect the interests of the child, without, as the hon. Gentleman suggested, either stigmatising patients or imposing a blanket ban.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am encouraged by the Minister's sentiments on stigma and on the motives behind this move. I urge him to remember that I said that there was a blanket presumption. That refers to the positive test that is required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is concerned that children may be distressed or disturbed by the odd behaviour of patients who are mentally ill. If that is the test, there may be fewer child visits than there were. In society, there are mentally ill people and I think that children are more able to adjust to what older people may consider to be odd behaviour. If we are to allow mentally ill people back into the community, we must overcome some of the prejudices that even children may have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are determined to overcome those prejudices. That is the thrust of our approach to modernising mental health services. However, it is not the job of any Minister to attempt, when discussing the draft code of practice, to prejudice decisions that might be made in respect of individual child visits. I am not saying that odd or unusual behaviour would be enough to deny access to a child. That judgment is for others to make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Who?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is clear from my answer of 19 January: the hospital managers will make those decisions, apprised of all the relevant information about what is in the child's best interests. I shall not prejudge individual applications, because none of them will come to me for decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have been able to reassure both hon. Gentlemen about the recommendation in the code. As a result of the consultation exercise, we were asked to include a reference to the interests of the child in the code of practice and we have responded to that. We are not imposing blanket bans, but we are clear that the interests of the child must come first in all these issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge raised two other issues, one of which concerned patients with personality disorders. In modernising mental health services, we set out the general strategy that we wanted to pursue and we have made the direction of travel clear. I confirm, however, that we want the widest possible discussion about the best way to take this policy forward, and that is what we shall have. We want to understand and address the serious issues not only of public safety, but of the safety of those who suffer from personality disorders themselves. The two go together. We want to develop a more rational, coherent and sensible policy for dealing with patients who suffer from severe personality disorders, and we shall pursue that agenda determinedly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to the medical services available to people in prisons. We are aware of the concerns and are committed to improving those services. We are discussing the matter and expect to be able to make some announcements soon about the best way to proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried in the short time available to deal with some of the hon. Gentleman's concerns. This is a sensible and practical draft code of practice, which reflects changes in legislation and case law, and confirms what we believe to be best practice. It will provide practical and useful guidance to all practitioners in the field, as well as to patients, on their entitlements and rights under the Mental Health Act, and will ensure that the Act works as intended. I commend the code of practice to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
