Rent Acts (Maximum Fair Rent) Order 1999</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Waterson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Eastbourne)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the Committee has considered the Rent Acts (Maximum Fair Rent) Order 1999 (S.I. 1999, No. 6).<br><br>
I am delighted to serve under your fair but firm chairmanship, Mrs. Roe.<br><br>
The measure is ill thought out and designed to solve the wrong problem. It sends the wrong message to those who might be interested in investing in our private rented sector. We should consider the survey that the property research unit of the department of land economy at Cambridge University carried out for the British Property Federation. It found a discernible change in investors' attitudes towards investment in the private rented sector. It claims that while only 30 per cent, of the institutions covered by the survey were currently involved, through equity investment or lending, in the private rented sector, twice that number are considering investing and believe that they could have started or increased their involvement in the next two years.<br><br>
The survey also concludes that Housing Ministers' proposals to regulate rent increases in the regulated fair rent sector could be portrayed as a response to specific problems. Even so, more than half the institutions viewed Ministers' proposals negatively and 40 per cent. believed that regulation would be extended to the assured and assured shorthold sector. The survey claims that institutions' almost unanimous response to the prospect of extending regulations to those sectors was that they would not invest in the private rented sector.<br><br>
The survey concludes that the long-term importance of the findings depends on the funding that is actually needed. An estimated £3 billion net new investment per annum is required for the private rented sector to grow effectively. The survey's final comment is:
<br><blockquote><p>"viability depends on the market sector remaining free of controls. If regulation is extended, institutional interest will disappear very quickly."</p></blockquote>
That is a crucial point.<br><br>
With the possible exception of the left on the Government Benches, we all support a viable and successful private rented sector in this country. The term "social inclusion" will remain a slogan unless people have decent homes. The private rented sector has a pivotal role in providing many of those homes.<br><br>
Many landlords agree that old Labour's fair rent formula was intrinsically fair. It provided that a fair rent constituted a market rent that would prevail for the relevant property in circumstances in which demand did not substantially exceed supply.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
Therefore, it was a genuine market rent—as someone famously said, "You can't buck the market"—but it factored out the scarcity element in a specific area. The tenant was protected against the scarcity premium and the landlord received a fair return on the inherent value of his investment.<br><br>
The British Property Federation and other landlords' organisations are genuinely apprehensive that the order will have an impact on capital values, cash flow, and therefore, the ability to fund repairs and improvements. It cannot be sensible to widen the gap between market and regulated rents. That differential has narrowed recently. The British Property Federation estimates that, using the capping formula in the order and assuming a constant retail price index of 2.5 per cent, per annum, it will take approximately 24 years for market and regulated rents to converge. Moreover, if market rents show any sign of moving forward, the gap will start to widen again.<br><br>
Approximately 5 million fair rent determinations have been made since a Labour Government introduced the formula in 1965. It is estimated that regulated tenants have benefited at the expense of landlords to the tune of £100 billion. Indeed, quite a number of registered fair rents still have a long way to go to achieve the levels envisaged under the previous formula.<br><br>
The Minister may seek to rely on some recent court decisions in order to justify this unhappy measure. A reference document produced on 17th June 1997 and updated on 11th January 1999 by the social policy section of the Library states:
<br><blockquote><p>"In the case of Spath Holme Ltd v Greater Manchester and Lancashire Rent Assessment Committee (1995) the landlord successfully argued that, as the company was offering similar properties in the same block at much higher assured tenancy rents, those of regulated fair rent tenants should be allowed to rise to levels higher than allowed by the RAC. The Court of Appeal held that the tenancies were similar and that scarcity of rented accommodation was not a factor in this case."</p></blockquote>
At the time, my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison), who was the Minister responsible, made it clear that the then Conservative Government rejected calls to intervene to stop changes in the light of the Spath Holme case.<br><br>
That case was followed in October 1997 by another Court of Appeal decision in Curtis v. London Rent Assessment Committee. There are various issues in that case that do not concern us today, but the essential point—as set out in the reference document to which I referred earlier—is that the Court of Appeal
<br><blockquote><p>"reaffirmed the principle established in the Spath Holme judgment that the starting point for a determination of a fair rent under section 70 of the 1977 Rent Act could only be the market rent, adjusted for scarcity."</p></blockquote>
Those decisions do no more than confirm the market rent approach, and that is also endorsed by the Institute of Rent Officers and Rental Valuers. What is more, rents declined sharply in the 1970s and 1980s—so much so that some fair rents do not even cover the cost of maintenance. What has happened since has been an inevitable market correction. The National
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0095">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
Trust pointed out in its response to the consultation paper that a large catching-up operation had been taking place.<br><br>
There is evidence from the BPF and elsewhere that because fair rents are reviewed on a two-year cycle, the majority of rents have already been reviewed, or are in the process of being reviewed, in the light of those judgments. Does the Minister agree with the view expressed by the Institute of Rent Officers and Rental Valuers in their response to the consultation document, that to cap increases now appears to be shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted?<br><br>
The Government should not be allowed to portray the issue as one between wicked rapacious landlords and poor downtrodden tenants. Apart from the substantial and responsible companies that are members of the BPF, there are also small landlords who can ill afford the Labour Government's brand of social engineering. I am indebted to my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) for giving me an example, in a letter from one of her constituents, who writes:
<br><blockquote><p>"Dear Mrs. Lait, I am writing on behalf of my 83 year old mother who purchased and then rented out a flat 35 years ago to a tenant who then became a 'sitting regulated tenant'."</p></blockquote>
She goes on:
<br><blockquote><p>"Because the rent my mother receives does not even cover the cost of repairs and maintenance to the flat she has tried to sell it, but because of the tenant she would have to sell the flat for half of its market value which doesn't seem very 'fair'."</p></blockquote>
She then goes on to say that she and her husband have an elderly parent, who is
<br><blockquote><p>"paying extra to live in sheltered accommodation, paying for carers, home helps etc."</p></blockquote>
while at the same time subsidising the tenant. She concludes:
<br><blockquote><p>"To impose these further restrictions on this rent and what is rightfully hers is surely immoral and wrong."</p></blockquote>
There are also major constitutional issues that I would like the Minister to deal with seriously in her reply. First, the measure is, in effect, retrospective legislation. It is a fundamental principle of natural justice in this country that that should be avoided wherever possible.<br><br>
Secondly, the order came into force on 1 February. Its effect, in simple terms, is to insert a new paragraph into schedule 11 of the Rent Act 1977. I question the constitutional propriety of using secondary powers to amend primary legislation in that way. Indeed, the Minister for London and Construction, has been positively brazen on the subject. Speaking in the House on 26 January 1998, he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"A more attractive option, which may be possible through secondary legislation, is the application of a maximum limit to the size of the rent increase".</p></blockquote>
He made it clear that that aim would require primary legislation. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"in view of the many other pressures on parliamentary time, any opportunity for that would be likely to lie some way ahead."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 26 January 1998; Vol. 305, c. 125.]</p></blockquote>
So the Government are following their usual fashion of going round the other way. On what precedent is the Minister relying for that constitutional outrage?<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
Does the Minister accept that a consequence of the measure may be a reversal of improvements in recent years in the private rented sector? Why did the Government ignore the views of the supply side of the industry in the consultation process and disregard sensible proposals for less damaging options?<br><br>
Is not the Government's real motive for introducing the measure to save on housing benefit payments? Does the Minister accept that the cap might have perverse effects, such as protecting wealthy tenants with, perhaps, two homes and large incomes, as well as tenants receiving housing benefit, whose full rent is paid by the state? Does the Minister have any proposals to compensate landlords who are unfairly treated by the order? Does an application for a new registration made on 1 February escape the cap? The formula includes the figures of 7.5 per cent, and 5 per cent. Why are those fixed amounts, no matter how long the interval between registrations?<br><br>
Under the primary legislation, regulated tenants can enter into rental agreements with landlords to pay more realistic rents. Will such agreements be overridden by the cap in the order?<br><br>
Does the minister accept that, under the order, the retail prices index increase will be two months short? That is because the RPI figure published in any month gives the RPI two months earlier. So the published RPI figure for the months of the new registration will be used, as opposed to the actual RPI figure for the month of the previous registration.<br><br>
Why is Scotland, apparently, not to have the benefit of a similar measure? Finally, will the Minister give an absolute commitment that the Government will not seek to extend such limits—or ones similar to them—to assured and assured shorthold tenancies that currently allow landlords to charge open market rents?<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will respond to my questions. I would be content, on one or two of them, if she would write to me after the Committee has finished sitting. Conservative Members have important concerns about the order, which has not been thought through. Its ultimate effect may be to reduce the supply of decent rented accommodation. I will not press for a Division, but that is subject to the Minister's comments.</span></p>
<p>10.42 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Housing (Ms Hilary Armstrong)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raised a number of issues, and voiced concerns that the British Property Federation has also expressed.<br><br>
I hope to reassure Committee members of the Government's commitment to a healthy private rented sector. However, we also wish to achieve the right balance for those who are in regulated tenancies. I therefore welcome the opportunity to explain to the Committee the steps that we have taken to limit rent increases for fair rent tentants.<br><br>
The Government are totally committed to providing a private rented sector that gives real choice to people seeking housing. There is a clear demand for privately rented accommodation, and estimates for household growth indicate that that demand will continue. We
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0096">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
are, therefore, committed to a policy framework for the sector which encourages new investment by responsible landlords. However that does not mean that we can ignore the present problems in the sector, particularly where those affect the most vulnerable tenants. Not all vulnerable tenants are on housing benefit. That is one reason why the higher rent increases have produced so much concern among regulated tenants.<br><br>
Some commentators, as well as the hon. Gentleman, have expressed fears that controls on fair rent increases will be seen as a prelude to wider rent controls, and that that will discourage new investment in the private rented market. Let me lay those fears to rest. The order addresses a transitional problem in a small and declining part of the rental market sector. The number of tenancies affected by the new limits on fair increases is small—some 120,000 private tenancies and some 235,000 secure tenancies of registered social landlords.<br><br>
The limits will not apply to lettings made after 15 January 1989; that is the deregulated sector which now accounts for 90 per cent, of all private lettings. They will not apply because landlords and tenants were aware when the Housing Act 1988 was introduced that market rents would be charged for new lettings and that rent increases would follow market trends.<br><br>
We have given repeated assurances that we have no plans to change the legal framework for deregulated private tenancies and I am happy to repeat those assurances today. I am pleased to say that there are signs that the message is getting across. Research published by the British Property Federation last year, the survey to which the hon. Gentleman referred, suggests that those institutions looking to invest in the sector were much less concerned about our proposals than those not looking to invest. In other words, those who were in touch with the Government's intentions and listening to what we were saying recognised that this was not an extension to all tenancies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Michael Spicer <span class='memberconstituency'>(West Worcestershire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister say how many private sector properties are available to let?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not have the figures with me this morning. I am happy to let the hon. Gentleman have them. This order would not affect any of them because if they were to be let, subsequent to the order, they would be let under the Housing Act 1988 and, therefore, would be part of the deregulated sector.<br><br>
It may be helpful if I explain why fair rent tenants have been facing exceptionally high rent increases in recent years, why we felt it appropriate to intervene to moderate increases in those particular and limited circumstances and how the new limit will operate. When the Housing Act 1988 introduced market rents for all new lettings, the right of existing regulated tenants to a fair rent was not changed. Those tenants and their landlords may still apply to have a fair rent registered for the tenancy every two years by an independent rent officer. They can appeal against the rent officer's decision to a rent assessment committee.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
Indeed, that answers one of the points that the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) raised. Where rent levels are agreed privately and not registered they will not come within the terms of the order. When setting fair rents, rent officers and committees are required by the Rent Act 1977 to take into account the age, character, locality and state of repair of the property, but to disregard any premium resulting from a scarcity of similar accommodation in the locality. The principle was first established long before that—in 1965.<br><br>
In the past, rent officers tended to decide rents by referral to fair rents previously determined for other comparable properties in a locality. Before 1989, when no evidence on market rents was available, that was the only practical approach. More recently, a number of landmark court cases have held that rent officers and committees should give more weight to market rents for comparable properties now that there is a growing volume of open-market evidence.<br><br>
The starting point should generally be the comparable market rent, which is then adjusted to take account of scarcity. Changing to this method caused fair rents to rise steeply in recent years. Fair rent increases have been well above increases in the retail prices index over the same period. Many tenants have faced rent increases on reregistration that were at least 10 percentage points highter than the increase in the retail prices index in the same period. In Merseyside, the average increase on reregistration was recently about 45 per cent.; in London, some tenants faced rent increases of 60 per cent, or more in two years. For example, a tenant in Hammersmith and Fulham had a rent increase of 65 per cent, in 1998, which took the rent to £7,750 per annum from £4,700 per annum in 1996. We all agree that it is the amount of increase that has proved a problem for some tenants. I have had representations about this from colleagues on both sides of the House.<br><br>
The previous Government introduced market rents for new lettings in 1989, but left intact the fair rent provision for existing tenants. We do not believe that at that time anyone could reasonably have expected rent increases of this magnitude under a fair rents system. Indeed, the right hon. Member for Louth and Horncastle (Sir P. Tapsell), who wrote to me last April, said:
<br><blockquote><p>"This seems to be a situation in which the courts have in effect overridden the declared aim of Parliament in passing the fair rent legislation and have changed the policies of the previous Government as well as the present one … it cannot make sense for rent restriction to be abandoned to this extent."</p></blockquote>
It is true that many landlords did not acquire their tenanted properties as speculative investments, or indeed, in some cases, acquire them for investment reasons at all. They may have inherited a property, built it, acquired it to house employees, or purchased it as part of a much wider property portfolio. However, that does not alter the fact that acquisition will have taken place against the background of the fair rent controls as they were understood and expected to work at the time. The idea that growth in rental income might massively exceed inflation will not have occurred to these landlords when they acquired
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0097">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
their properties. Therefore, given the problems being reported to us, we felt that there was a strong case for Government intervention.<br><br>
The order does not change the way in which fair rents are determined under the Rent Act 1977. It simply limits exceptionally high fair rent increases under the Act. Linking rent increases to the change in the retail prices index means that they will follow the change of market rents. In addition, in recognition of fair rent increases being artificially low in the early 1990s, we have allowed a further uplift of 7.5 per cent above RPI for the first application made after the order comes into force and 5 per cent, for subsequent applications. Ultimately—except in the most extreme cases—this will allow fair rents to reach the limit that they would have reached had we not introduced a limit, but at a slower rate.<br><br>
There are two exemptions from the limit. It will not apply if there is no existing fair rent registration for the property. We also felt that there should be an incentive for landlords to carry out major works to the property. The order therefore exempts landlords from the limit where a substantial rent increase—which we have defined as a rent increase of at least 15 per cent.—is due because of an improvement in the property's condition resulting from repairs or improvements by the landlord.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Waterson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that an effect of the order may be to widen the gap again between regulated and market rents? If so, does she consider that a good thing?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have made it clear that the order will slow down movement towards direct comparability between the two. However, any Government must consider the interests of the entire group affected by an order. We cannot consider only the landlord's interest. We must consider what the law assumed, and what people assumed that the law meant, when the new regulations came into play, and the effect that changes in the market have had on those assumptions.<br><br>
We do not accept that the measures override the principle of a fair rent. Most landlords and tenants could never have antcipated increases of the magnitude that have occurred in some parts of the country under fair rent legislation. It has been suggested that the order introduces a new element of affordability into the fair rent system and requires the rent officer to take account for the first time of a tenant's personal circumstances. It does no such thing. The provisions apply uniformly to all tenants, irrespective of their personal circumstances. In many cases, the fair rent will continue to be determined exactly as before under the original Rent Act principles. It is only in cases where the increase in fair rent would otherwise have outstripped inflation by a generous margin that the order will slow the increase to a level that is manageable for the tenants and consistent with what would until very recently have been the high point of the landlord's reasonable expectations.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
The hon. Member for Eastbourne asked how the Government justified the measure as retrospective legislation. It is not retrospective. It applies only to applications for rent registration made to a rent officer on or after 1 February, the date when the order came into effect. He also asked why the order did not apply to Scotland. It relates to limits to fair rents in England and Wales. The fair rent provisions in Scotland are broadly similar, but fair rent increases are generally significantly lower there. There are therefore no plans to introduce a limit in Scotland, but my colleagues will keep the relevant matters under review and act if necessary.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also expressed constitutional outrage—which I thought was a bit over the top—because the measure was being passed through secondary legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Waterson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have got over it now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Good. The order indeed modifies primary legislation. It modifies schedule 11 to the Rent Act 1977 in respect of those applications for registration of a new rent to which the order applies. Section 31 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985, under which the order is made, provides the Secretary of State with the power to include within the order
<br><blockquote><p>"provisions excluding, adapting or modifying any provision made by or under any enactment (whenever passed) relating to rent."</p></blockquote>
That provision in the 1985 Act was subject to parliamentary scrutiny during its passage through both Houses, though I accept that neither the hon. Gentleman nor I were Members of Parliament then.<br><br>
I think that the hon. Member for Eastbourne referred to the European convention on human rights—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Waterson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case I shall not mention it. I do not want to detain the Committee longer than I need to.<br><br>
In summary, the order is designed simply to ensure that the protection that has long been afforded to regulated tenants works as it was intended and expected to do. The important point is that it is a limited measure to address a small and transitional problem. It is not, I stress again, the prelude to wider rent control. The vast majority of tenancies are, and will continue to be, unaffected by the order. I do not expect Conservative Members to go as far as the hon. Member for Louth and Horncastle who in a letter to me in January, declared the measures "eminently fair and reasonable". However, I hope that they will agree, on the basis of what I have said, to let the order stand.</span></p>
<p>11.1 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Michael Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Despite the Minister's assurances about the limited application of the order, one is still left wondering how limited it is. In view of applications made under section 13 of the Rent (Agriculture) Act 1976 and section 87 of the Rent Act 1977, the order may be less limited than she suggested. However, the problem is that the order sends out all the wrong signals to the private rented sector.<br><br>

There are two main difficulties. The first is that our private rented sector is small compared with other countries—Germany, for example, whose private rented sector is around five times bigger than ours. That is a problem because it can lead to labour immobility and inflexibility. It is important to recognise how small our private sector is.<br><br>
Secondly, a great deal of private accommodation that could be rented out remains empty. I am surprised that the Minister did not have an answer at her fingertips on that. When I was a Minister with responsibility for housing—and you, Mrs. Roe, were my wonderful Parliamentary Private Secretary at the time—the fact that we had 600,000 empty private sector houses was at the forefront of my mind. My gut feeling is that it remains at around 500,000, if not more, which represents a serious distortion in the housing market.<br><br>
If the objective of housing policy is to make the best use of the housing stock that we can manage—surely it must be—it is important that there remains a disincentive for landlords to come forward and use our existing housing stock. That applies particularly to property above shops in city centres.<br><br>
The fact that the Minister does not know how many empty houses there are is a serious feature of the landscape. If she is serious about not developing new green-field sites because housing stock is available in existing areas, focusing on private rentable sector should be a high priority—for her and for any Government. The signals that she is sending out now—that the Government are prepared further to distort the private sector, albeit in a limited way—cannot be good for encouraging private landlords to offer their current properties or to develop new ones.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne said, there is great potential investment in the private sector, but it is not forthcoming at the moment. Sending out the wrong signals must, as I said, be bad news in the long term for those concerned with the proper use of housing. The Minister is being disingenuous in saying that the proposal is different from that which applies to the mainstream of private rented accommodation. Factually, she is right; that sector is only 10 per cent, of the market, but the proposal sends signals. It is a distorted move that will cause alarm among potential private landlords. Given the problems in that sector, the Government should be encouraging people with property to let to come into the marketplace. Of course, abuse of the system such as bullying tenants was made illegal under the Conservative Administration and carries criminal penalties, but distorting the marketplace is a different matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roger Casale <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wimbledon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman mentioned the large amount of rented accommodation available in Germany as if there were no legislation in that country of the kind proposed here. In fact there is extensive legislation in Germany to protect landlords and tenants which is similar to the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
measure before us. It has not been a disincentive in Germany; why does the hon. Gentleman believe that it sends the wrong message in this country?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Michael Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Most of the legislation in Germany relates to bullying and other bad practices by landlords, and rightly so. Germany is, of course, now in socialist hands and could rapidly go in the wrong direction, to the detriment of the economy. Legislation in this country was tightened up by the Conservative Government. German landlords earn a proper return on their investments; that is why they let their property. Thus there is a large and vibrant rented sector in Germany which encourages greater mobility and benefits the economy. Of course, bad practices must be stamped out. It is a matter of striking the right balance in the marketplace and encouraging people to let empty property, especially accommodation above shops in towns and city centres.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will do more to encourage private landlords rather than implementing primary and secondary legislation that sends the wrong signals to people who have empty houses which could be put to better use.</span></p>
<p>11.7 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I reject what the hon. Member for West Worcestershire (Sir M. Spicer) said. The order is small and specific; it is designed to solve a particular problem. I repeat what I said earlier. When people invested in the properties that are subject to the order there was no expectation of the huge returns that would result from the change in legislation in 1988. As I said, Governments must strike a balance between commitments made to people living in rented houses, taking into account the nature of their tenancies, and landlords' understanding of what would be the return on their investments at the time.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman is talking about the much greater problem of how to encourage financial institutions to buy housing as an investment and to increase the amount of private rented sector accommodation. The Conservative Government introduced several different initiatives, none of which produced the effect that he wants. For example, housing investment trusts, which were introduced in the latter years of the Conservative Administration, did not take off. We have been unable to make them work. We shall present other ideas. I am consulting the private sector to find ways in which to work with it, and to ascertain why we have been unable to attract the investment that we would like.<br><br>
However, the order covers a small group of tenancies. I do not know whether the tenants involved went to see the hon. Member for West Worcestershire. They are not on housing benefit, but earn a fixed income, which is just above the figure that would qualify for housing benefit. They have suffered from the way in which the rents have been reasssessed in recent months. Therefore, the order deals with a short-term problem. No one who enters into a new tenancy will have that protection. The order applies to a limited group of properties.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0099">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
I confess that I do not go about with figures in my head. I am not that sort of person. I emphasise to the hon. Member for West Worcestershire that I have been more worried about the increasing number of empty properties than many previous Ministers with responsibility for housing. I am told that, in previous years, local authorities did not dare to admit that the problem existed because, if they did, they would be denied future investment.<br><br>
The housing market differs greatly in different areas of the country. In some areas, people simply walk away from many houses and refuse to accept them. That casues problems. We are dealing with them in ways that have never been previously tried.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Waterson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me pursue the Minister of the figures. If she was a Health Minister, surely she would know how many people were on the waiting list. If she was a Defence Minister, she would know how many people were in the Army. Why does not she know the answer to the simple question that we have asked?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I do not remember such figures. If I was asked about unemployment figures in my constituency, I would have to go back and find out. I cannot retain figures, for which I apologise. It is not a matter of efficiency. My officials have now given me the information, but I am not sure that it is relevant to our debate. I try to be honest with Opposition Members, but they try to score silly political points. The previous Government were never honest about the number of void properties in this country. There are almost 700,000 empty private sector properties. They are not in the private rented sector because many are in the process of being sold. No one knows the exact figure.<br><br>
The hon. Member for West Worcestershire asked me how many private rented properties were vacant. I do not have those figures, and I suspect that he never had them. If he wants to make a fuss about the way in which the figures are kept, I shall join in, but it is rather silly, and I shall not take any more interventions on the matter.<br><br>
The housing market is hugely varied throughout the country. Some private rented sector properties should not be let. In the next couple of weeks, we shall introduce a consultation document on houses in multiple occupation and their licensing. Too many vulnerable tenants have been exposed to risks in houses that are not fit for occupation. We believe that it is important to do something about that.<br><br>
The constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Burnley (Mr. Pike) has the highest number of voids in the country because of huge changes in the private rented sector and the market. It is deeply unhelpful to use a global figure. There are no vacancies in London at present; everything is taken up. In places like Burnley, Oldham and other areas of the north-west there are significant vacancies. But a void property in Burnley is no use to someone working in London. That is why the most important factor is not the crude number: the essential message is what we are doing to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
get a more stable and sustainable housing market that will encourage investment and provide the quality of houses in which people want to live.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter L. Pike <span class='memberconstituency'>(Burnley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has seen the problem in north-east Lancashire, as have other Ministers on many occasions. We have 3,000 empty properties in Burnley, 300 of them council houses and 200 housing association properties to rent. There are a small number of private sector rented properties and the rest are available for sale on the open market but are terraced houses that no one wants to buy. There is a decline in the population and we are building new houses because builders want to. At the end of the day a local authority such as Burnley will have to demolish them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are beginning to stray from the order. This is not a simple, straightforward issue. It is not possible to say that there are 600,000 empty houses so there should be no waiting lists anywhere. Life is more complex and the housing market operates in different ways. We are keen to encourage activity in the private rented sector and to make sure that it is done in a way which reassures both landlords and tenants that this is a form of tenure that offers them the opportunities that they are looking for and the sort of security and safety that we must be concerned about too.<br><br>
Just so that Conservative Members do not think that I quote only one of their hon. Friends, I shall read out a letter from the right hon. Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Mr. Clark). He writes:
<br><blockquote><p>"A very large number of my constituents who are statutory tenants are concerned about the increases in rent which are being imposed on them by the landlords.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>I have always been uneasy on this question, even though I recognise that I am expected to pay deference to 'market forces'. And I appreciate the irony of a Conservative Member of Parliament approaching you and appealing for interventionist assistance."</p></blockquote>
We are giving some assistance to the right hon. Gentleman and his constituents and to others while at the same time upholding our determination to have a robust private rented sector. I hope that on that basis we can proceed with the order.</span></p>
<p>11.18 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Michael Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister slurred the Office for National Statistics in saying that in some way the figures for vacant private properties were fiddled when we were in office. [<i>Interruption.</i>] She said that we had fiddled the figures.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Armstrong</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What I am saying is that, in the social rented sector, there was never any admission of what was going on. Authority after authority now acknowledge that they did not admit to the number of difficult to let properties they had, nor to the number of voids that they were finding difficult to re-let. They felt that if they did that they would be told that they did not need any money for further investment or further help with those properties. In vast areas of the country money was put into social housing without a proper strategic framework. For example, 100 houses were
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0100">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
pulled down last week in Newcastle that had benefited from state renewal challenge funding under the previous Government. Millions of pounds had been uselessly poured in.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Michael Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We will see what the <i>Official Report</i> says, but I am pretty certain that I heard the Minister say that we had in some way fudged or fiddled the figures of vacant properties in the private sector. We would have had no incentive to do that because the thrust of our argument was that it was a large sector and we needed to do more to improve the position of landlords. We would have had the opposite motivation.<br><br>
The figures that the Minister has given us show that, under this Government, the number of empty private sector properties has risen from the figure of about
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
600,000 that we left behind to the figure of 700,000 that her officials have just given her. That is a rise of 100,000 during this Government's tenure in office. If one adds to that, which she rightly did when she answered me, the public sector empty houses, the result is over 1 million empty houses in this country. That figure needs to be put on the record time and time again. It is a massive indictment of the system, whatever party is in charge. Before we start building houses all over green-field sites we should recognise that there are 1 million unoccupied dwellings in this country. That is an important point to have on the record.</span></p>
