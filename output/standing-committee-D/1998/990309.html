Education (Infant Class Sizes) (Grant) Regulations 1999</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Theresa May <span class='memberconstituency'>(Maidenhead)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Education (Infant Class Sizes) (Grant) Regulations 1999.</p></blockquote>
I welcome you, Mr. Stevenson, to the Chair. This is the first time that I have had the pleasure of serving under your chairmanship.<br><br>
The regulations arise from sections of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 on the requirement placed by the Government on local authorities to ensure that a limit is placed on infant class sizes in maintained schools, whether they are infant schools or primary schools.<br><br>
Like other Committee members, I spent many long hours in Standing Committee debating in depth the School Standards and Framework Bill and, indeed, the clauses to which the regulations refer. Unfortunately, we were unable to see the Government's proposed draft regulations on those issues. We would have preferred to have been able to consider them as a whole, even if they were only draft outlines.<br><br>
The regulations, S.I. 1999, No. 14, relate to section 3 of the Act. They provide for the Secretary of State to regulate the terms on which grants may be paid to local education authorities to reduce infant class sizes. Money will be made available for the employment of extra staff and for capital projects such as the building of new classrooms. Such projects might include the provision of additional space for, say, an extra classroom to reduce numbers in an existing infant class. Traditionally, a school might have 32 or 33 pupils in its infant class and would therefore require extra space to reduce that number to 30. A school might also incorporate classes from other schools. Some local education authorities are looking at merging schools to achieve the infant class size reduction that is required under the Act.<br><br>
Much has been made of the fact that, to back up their pledge to ensure that local education authorities are able to reduce infant class sizes, the Government have made grants available to authorities. However, the regulations raise a number of questions about the Government's intentions in relation to those grants and the way in which they will be used by local education authorities.<br><br>
The circumstances in which grants will be made available to local authorities, given the fluctuating nature of pupil numbers in schools, was debated particularly strenuously in Standing Committee. In any one or two years, an infant class might contain
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
more than 30 pupils. As I understand it, under the plan for reducing infant class sizes, local education authorities will have to apply for money in advance. An authority might anticipate that circumstance and apply for a grant to provide, say, extra capital for the building of a classroom to accommodate extra pupils. However, pupil numbers might subsequently prove such that the classroom was not in fact needed to meet the infant class size reduction proposals.<br><br>
The regulations attach conditions to payment of the grant. First, the grant can be paid only if the local authority's plan to reduce class sizes has been approved by the Secretary of State. Secondly, the Secretary of State can determine what amount of the grant applied for shall be provided to a local education authority, and whether it should be 100 per cent. or less than 100 per cent. of the approved expenditure to which it relates.<br><br>
I wish to concentrate on part III of the regulations, under the heading "Supplemental", especially regulation 9, which provides that the Secretary of State may attach certain requirements to payment of the grant to the local education authority. Under those requirements the Secretary of State may require the local authority to repay the grant and may require the payment of interest on sums due. I do not recall the issue of repayment of grant being raised at all during discussions on the School Standards and Framework Act 1998.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. May</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman confirms my recollection of what happened in the Standing Committee.<br><br>
It is, at best, unfortunate that the Government failed to raise the issue when we considered the 1998 Act because it is fundamental to the way in which the Government propose to fund their infant class size reduction pledge, and to the expectations of local education authorities in planning their budgets and making plans to reduce infant class sizes. The suggestion that, having been made a grant to ensure the reduction of infant class sizes, the Secretary of State may somehow require that the grant or some portion of the grant be repaid to the Government, is an issue that has not been raised before. If that is the Government's intention, it should be made absolutely clear.<br><br>
The Government made an announcement last week, with much fanfare and blowing of trumpets, about money being made available—it was a sum that they had already announced twice before, but we are getting used to that—but they failed to give the detail. Another lesson that we are learning from this Government is that the devil is always in the detail. The headlines may sound fine—motherhood and apple pie—but when one considers the detail, one discovers the dangers that are lurking and the practical problems that will arise.<br><br>
Therefore, I ask the Minister to make absolutely clear what proposals on the repayment of grants accompany the regulations. A local education authority, which has submitted its infant class size
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0217">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
reduction plan as required under the Act, had it approved by the Secretary of State and received a Government grant under part II of the regulations, be it 100 per cent. or less of its approved expenditure, will spend that money on whatever in its plan has been approved, on the understanding that that is what was required to achieve its infant class size reduction plan and what the Government agreed it could do.<br><br>
If the Government are now saying that, at some stage in future, they might ask the local education authority to repay some or all of the grant, that is an entirely different picture, and it is necessary for local education authorities to know exactly where they stand. Many have already made proposals and many have received notification of grant on the understanding that it was given to them so that they could build classrooms or employ teachers in order to achieve reductions in infant class sizes with no expectation that, somewhere down the road, they will have to adjust their budgets to meet the repayment requirements.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Lady read regulation 9(3)(d), which refers to the ability of the Secretary of State—admittedly after consultation—to "vary" the requirement? Could the Secretary of State suddenly require the repayment of a grant that had already been allocated, or of interest on that grant?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs May</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising that pertinent point. He is absolutely right—a local authority might apply for a grant and receive it on the understanding that it may have to repay it, and subsequently have to repay it. I am particularly concerned about grants that have already been allocated to local education authorities. Have the Government told LEAs that have had their grant applications approved that some of the grant may have to be repaid? Have they told those LEAs that the relevant conditions may vary? Although the Government may have said that a grant does not need to be repaid, they may be able subsequently to require an LEA to repay it.<br><br>
I have discussed the repayment of grant, but we should also consider the payment of interest on sums that are due to the Secretary of State. I have discussed regulation 9(2)(b) and regulation 9(2)(d), but we also need to consider regulation 9(2)(c), which refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"the payment to the Secretary of State of other sums related to the value of assets acquired, provided or improved with the aid of grant".</p></blockquote>
What does that rather sinister sub-paragraph mean? The Secretary of State may say to an LEA, "Fine. You want to build classrooms in X, Y and Z primary schools in order to meet the infant class sizes pledge. By doing so, you will improve the value of a school's assets. We will also require you to pay us some sums of money." That was never hinted at during the passage of the School Standards and Framework Act. With reference to regulation 9(2)(c), what "other sums" of money do the Government have in mind?<br><br>
Regulation 9(2)(d) refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"the payment of interest on sums due to the Secretary of State".</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
Are the sums those that are contained in regulation 9(2)(c), or do they involve interest that would be due if a local authority were subsequently required to repay a Government grant? Could a local authority be required to repay interest, perhaps over a specified period?<br><br>
In a nutshell, the problem with the regulations is that they give LEAs no confidence in Government grants. We are all acquainted with the difficulties that LEAs and local authorities suffered as a result of the bad settlement that many of them received from the Government this year. Local authorities are having to increase other budgets to passport increases in education spending to schools.<br><br>
Social services departments are suffering because of the way in which the Government chose to provide funding. Shire counties and shire unitaries have been hit especially hard by their settlement. LEAs are already in the difficult position of having to search for extra funds. Some London LEAs, for example, find it difficult to fund a teachers' pay award, which was not fully funded by Government. They are already finding it difficult to deliver the education budgets that they believe are right for their schools. Those budgets may be raided by the Government to repay grants that were made available in the expectation that the money needed to be paid only because it was meeting a Government pledge. Many local education authorities would question the Government's intentions and examine closely their glossy headlines about grants.<br><br>
The regulations introduce uncertainty for local authorities, schools and council tax payers because of the bills that they may have to pay should the Government requirement repayment of sums or payment of extra sums to the Secretary of State under the regulations. That was not mentioned when the School Standards and Framework Bill was being considered and it is incumbent on the Government to make absolutely clear exactly what burdens they will impose on local education authorities through the regulations.</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Phil Willis <span class='memberconstituency'>(Harrogate and Knaresborough)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for arriving one minute late for the start of the Committee; it was an unforgivable indiscretion.<br><br>
It is always interesting to follow the hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) and to hear how the Tory party has had a change of heart. The Tories are now friends of the NUT, the NUSAWT and LEAs. All we need for completeness is an announcement from an Opposition Front Bencher that the Tories want teachers to be paid in euros.<br><br>
I support almost everything that the hon. Lady said, but that is not a bid to change our position, although my hon. Friend the Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) may say something else.<br><br>
The pledge to reduce class sizes was popular and the Liberal Democrats and the Labour party campaigned strongly for it before the general election. We were delighted to see that on the pledge card and we were delighted that it was implemented in the School Standards and Framework Act. The hon. Member for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0218">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
Maidenhead and her hon. Friends opposed the provision but the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Mrs. Browning)—I am pleased to see her in the Committee this morning—and the right hon. Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell) said that they had been wrong and that class sizes matter. I remember the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton saying that they should fall to 25.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Angela Browning <span class='memberconstituency'>(Tiverton and Honiton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Official Report is consulted, it will show that the hon. Gentleman is being rather poetic with his interpretation of what was said on the School Standards and Framework Bill. I did not say that class sizes should be reduced to 25; I challenged the Government to explain why, if they believed that class sizes should fall to 30, they should not fall to 25. The Government failed to answer the question, as usual.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The record will show that the hon. Lady said that there was empirical evidence to suggest that 25 was a better number than 30, but we must not disagree because we are friends.<br><br>
The Government must regret the way in which they took the pledge through the House and the Standing Committee. There was agreement on both sides of the Committee about the reduction in class sizes, but we wanted to achieve that with the minimum impact on the organisation in schools, LEAs and Government. We wanted flexibility, but the then Minister for School Standards, the right hon. Member for Tyneside, North (Mr. Byers) and the present Minister made it clear that the Government were not for turning and that there would be no compromise, so the rigid provision was forced through.<br><br>
The pledge has created enormous difficulties for LEAs, schools and now for the Government. The hon. Member for Maidenhead is right to say that the £150 million for revenue and capital spend, which was announced last week, has been recycled. The reality was hidden—before the election we were told that the ending of assisted places would produce £60 to £70 million, which then increased to £100 million, and that that would pay for the lowering of class sizes. But on 2 November 1998, the Minister admitted in a written answer, at column 405, that the phasing out of assisted places would produce savings of £85 million by the end of 1999–2000. On 18 November 1998, in the Eighth Standing Committee on Delegated Legislation, at column 24, the Minister stated that the cost of the introduction would be £620 million, which is ten times the original figures. The difference in cost terms is £535 million. That should be put on the record, as it represents the reality.<br><br>
Liberal Democrats are delighted that £620 million will be spent on primary schools, but head teachers and LEAs should have been given greater discretion to allow more flexibility in that spending. According to an answer that the Minister gave me on capital spend on 2 March this year—in response to a question on 10 February—the shortfall between the capital expenditure bid for by LEAs to meet the class size
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
reduction pledge, and the amount that they actually received, was £159.3 million. That is a significant shortfall. In a previous Committee, I asked the Minister whether the class size pledge would be met with temporary classrooms. She will remember that she said that it would not, and that she would not approve any bid by a local authority that met the class size pledge with temporary classrooms.<br><br>
Does that commitment still stand? Has she approved any local authority requirement to meet the class size pledges for its capital build through the use of temporary classrooms? If so, the regulations would be put in a different frame. Clearly, erecting temporary buildings to meet the class size pledge, and obtaining money to do so from the Government, would be a different interpretation of the regulations, especially part III, the supplemental regulations.<br><br>
On part II, regulation 3, does the infant class supplementary grant cover LEAs for the cost of temporary buildings? Yes or no. If that is the only way in which the school can meet the pledge, will the school be ruled out from receiving capital? Will those schools therefore not be able to admit the children? The Minister must clarify that.<br><br>
Regulation 9 deals with the repayment of grant, and the hon. Member for Maidenhead was absolutely right to raise the issue. It is the first time—the Minister will correct me if I am wrong—that a Government have given capital grant to an LEA on the basis that if the value of the buildings is enhanced as a result, the Government should take a slice of any subsequent sale. That is my interpretation of regulation 9(2)(c).<br><br>
My last point is on the repayment of grant, which is dealt with by part III. If a school uses money that it is given to reduce class sizes and for new build to build classrooms for key stage 2, in order to free up facilities for key stage 1, does that give the Government the right to say, "You have not met the letter of the law. Therefore, we can ask the LEA to reclaim the money"? Schools need to be as flexible as possible in interpreting the regulations and meeting the class size pledge. Will the Minister clarify whether the Government are specifically saying, "Unless the build is for key stage 1, you are not entitled to the money and we have the right to claim it back"?</span></p>
<p>10.55 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Browning</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister add further detail to the interpretation of part III? In passing, I should say that I found it a bit rich to hear a Liberal Democrat advocate head teachers and schools being given more flexibility in the way in which they spend money. In the previous Parliament and during proceedings on the School Standards and Framework Bill Liberal Democrats spoke eloquently about the need for LEAs to take those decisions rather than head teachers and individual schools. I, too, am delighted that they have had a change of heart.<br><br>
The money is divided into two parts. A capital allocation goes to additional classrooms and much of the rest is taken up by the recruitment of additional teachers. If we are concerned about the possible repayment of capital expenditure by the LEA or, as is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0219">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
more likely, an arbitrary adjustment of the education standing spending assessment from the centre to claw money back without negotiation, what happens when the money is specifically allocated for the recruitment of new teachers? Will teachers recruited under this grant money know that the contracts could be short-term contracts, or will they be taken on under the usual terms and conditions of employment, without realising that the money has a termination date not far down the track?<br><br>
My second question relates to the allocation of capital for new classrooms. If the money is to be clawed back from the LEA, will there be a knock-on effect on the school? I see from the list that the majority of schools that have received their grant have received it for one classroom. Some schools, particularly in urban areas, have three or four classrooms, but some LEAs would have only a few new classrooms in their catchment area. Lancashire has 61 classrooms under this grant and Nottinghamshire has 38. Any one financial year's standard spending assessment clawback would make a significant difference to the education SSA for that authority. How will LEAs absorb that money? Would they have to spread it uniformly across all schools or all primary schools, or would the LEA change a school's allocation simply because it had two or three classrooms?<br><br>
We have now had a chance to see the regulations in detail, which we could not do when the Bill was before us in Committee. When the Government introduced the policy of 30 in a class, I asked the right hon. Member for Tyneside, North, who is now the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, on the Floor of the House shortly after the election how the provisions would be put into practice in rural areas. He said, "That's a very good question. It's a question that I have asked myself."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for School Standards (Ms Estelle Morris)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So he answered the question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Browning</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He answered the question, but it is something that the Government should have thought through before taking the opinion of some focus group, producing the policy and now having to work out the detail of putting it into practice fairly. As I look at the allocation of the grant, I see that in rural areas very few new classrooms will be built as a result. Is it the case that where urban schools will receive capital grants under the scheme, in rural areas, vertical streaming will help the Minister to implement her policy? If so, that is extremely disadvantageous, especially to children in rural primary schools where treachers already teach across an age range, which has a knock-on effect to key stage 2.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Ms Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you to the Chair, Mr Stevenson. This is the first time that I have served under your chairmanship.<br><br>
The debate is notable for what has not, rather than was has, been said. This is the third context in which I have discussed class sizes. The first was during consideration of the School Standards and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
Framework Bill and the second was in relation to the regulations. On each of those two previous occasions, the Opposition started by saying that we would not meet the pledge, we would not deliver, we would deny parental choice, we would make children travel miles to school and we would impose vertical grouping. With the exception of vertical grouping, which was just mentioned by the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton, none of those things has been raised today because the reality is that, today, every parent, teacher and local authority knows that the Government will deliver on that key pledge.<br><br>
Let us not forget what that means. It will mean goodbye to five, six and seven-year-olds having to be educated, in those vital early years, in classes of45,35, 32 or 31 pupils. I believe that matters. The best thing we can do for children is to ensure that they have small class sizes in those early years and give them a fighting chance to learn the basic skills that they need.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. May</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I make a little progress?<br><br>
Our announcement last week was not an oft-repeated announcement. I do not deny that there is not the odd occasion on which the Government—<i>[Laughter.]</i> But that was not the allocation for this year. The overall allocation has been made once or twice—<i>[Interruption.]</i> That part of the revene for this year has been allocated only once, but I suppose that it is still early and we might refer to it again.<br><br>
However, no one knew until last Thursday that, by September, the number of infants in such large classes will be reduced to under 200,000, whereas, at the time of the general election, it stood at 480,000. That is possible due to the extra provision of classrooms and teachers from the money that we announced last week—1,000 extra classrooms and 4,300 extra teachers in those classrooms. That is to be welcomed.<br><br>
Since the previous debate, we have now approved all the class size plans and have a clear timetable for implementation. The scheme will be implemented almost in full by September 2000, and it will be implemented in full throughout all local authorities by September 2001, a full year ahead of our pledge. I had honestly thought that someone had prayed against the regulations as an opportunity to celebrate the success of our class size policies and give credit to a Government who have kept their pledge. Perhaps I should have known better.<br><br>
We should be examining part III, the supplemental regulations, and having a good old debate about the letter of the regulations, for the benefit of those who want to put the fear of God into hon. Members that we intend to claw the money back. It might be useful if I explained what approval of the plan means. We have worked closely with local authorities, which in turn have worked closely with parents and schools to produce a plan for fulfilling the pledge. I pay tribute to local authorities for the speed with which they have worked and their co-operation. The extra work has been done without public complaint, although I cannot promise that there has not been the odd private moan when we have demanded more information
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0220">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
more quickly. Their willingness has, I think, stemmed from their understanding of how important it is that we get this show on the road.<br><br>
After approval of the plan—this is important and I do not want anyone to get the wrong idea—we shall not ask for the return of any money provided for its support. We shall not retrieve the grant, charge interest on it or change our mind—and if, say an extra classroom is sold at some time in the future, we shall not do anything other than Governments normally do. We shall not take any of the money.<br><br>
Part III is intended to preserve the Government's position and safeguard the public purse if a local authority does not spend the money on the items in the plan. I shall give an extreme example. If it decided not to build classrooms, after we had provided the money, but decided instead to build a leisure centre, town hall or go-kart track, we would, under the supplemental regulations, have the right to claim the money back because that was not what it had been given for. The reference to assets relates to what might have been purchased with the money. We should retain our power to charge interest on that.<br><br>
If what hon. Members are asking of me is an assurance that money properly spent to carry out the plan agreed with us will not be claimed back, I am happy to comply. I hope that hon. Members will accept that—as is always the case—the regulations have been drafted to cover every eventuality. We know that that is sometimes needed. The letter of the law is what matters in the end. I should be livid if I discovered that a local authority had built not the extra classrooms but a town hall and that I or my successors could not do a thing about it.<br><br>
I do not think that the approach in the supplemental regulations is a new one. I am informed that it is fairly standard practice. For example, the Education (Grants for Education Support and Training) (England) Regulations 1998 (S.I. 1998/656) that were made under sections 484 and 489 of the Education Act 1996 do the same. They are essential measures to ensure that the Government can protect the public purse. If the fears expressed by hon. Members in their opening comments came to fruition, I should be just as worried about that.<br><br>
I should like to deal with temporary classrooms, because having reread the debate that we had previously, I double-checked about them. To the best of my knowledge we have approved no funding for temporary classrooms other than for those needed while a permanent classroom was built. In those cases the temporary classroom would be approved as part of the capital allocation. When we examined that handful of cases it emerged that by putting up a temporary classroom for, say, three years, until the permanent classroom was built, local authorities could make substantial progress with a school.<br><br>
We did not allow temporary classrooms to be put up during building in every case. Certain circumstances led to that happening. Because of the very legitimate points that the hon. Member for Harrogate and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) raised about the matter in Committee previously, I sought assurances about every instance. I should be disappointed if in future I was told that there was no intention to build the permanent classroom in a particular instance. The cases have been carefully considered, because the pledge needed to be kept.<br><br>
As to mixed age classes, strangely, rural schools rather than urban schools have them. They are used to handling them in a way that as a teacher I would not choose to do. My admiration abounds for two-class schools—one infant, one junior—that teach five to sevens and seven to elevens, and we ought not to pretend that that does not happen. Indeed, past practice has almost always been to close rural schools because there were not sufficient children to make up single age group classes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Browning</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Looking at capital allocations for the rural counties with which I am familiar, one realises that few new classroms are being allocated because they go mainly to largely urban schools, for reasons that I understand. Rural schools are used to teaching across an age range, but in the past few months this has often meant children going up to the next class before they should, or need to, simply in the interests of achieving that base level figure of 30 to a class for infant schools. That is the dangerous part.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady must remember that the fact that there is nothing in capital allocation to say that money is there for a classroom does not mean that an extra classroom is not being provided. Many schools have new bricks and mortar—classrooms into which they were waiting to put teachers—and many schools are meeting the pledge and creating extra classrooms through using space in existing classrooms. I do not know which county the hon. Lady is talking of or whether her comment was general rather than specific. She did not name a county, but that often happens.<br><br>
In negotiations with local education authorities, I made it clear to officials that people should not be forced to teach mixed age groups if they were reluctant to do so. I felt that it was wrong and would lead to bad teaching because some teachers were unwilling.<br><br>
Many local authorities whose schools already teach mixed classes have rearraanged figures for admissions so as to continue to teach mixed classes. This may mean that they are teaching more mixed classes rather than that they have never taught mixed classes. I cite Solihull as an example, merely because it is adjacent to my constituency. I know for a fact that its first class size plan, which involved changing to mixed age classes, was rejected by teachers. It was therefore not approved by the authority, which went back to the beginning, and came up with a plan that did not oblige teachers to teach mixed age classes.<br><br>
Our aim all along has been not to force mixed age classes if teachers and parents do not want them. However, some teachers feel able to teach them and are happy to meet the pledge because there will be fewer children in a class. That is an important aspect in the teaching of mixed age classes. It would be wrong
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0221">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
to give the Committee an assurance that there will not be extra mixed age classes. What I can say is that in some instances it is already the practice, and that in others there has not been substantial opposition from teachers and others in local government. I have not forced any local authority or teacher to teach mixed age classes if they did not wish to do so. The educationist and teacher rather than the politician in me would have been most uneasy about doing that. I hope that I have allayed any fears that members of the Committee may have.<br><br>
We are part of the way through the month of delivery of the Government's class size pledge. I feel that after little less than 18 months in government, this is the time to celebrate the delivery of a May 1997 pledge that will make a genuine difference to the standard of education that we offer children. Yorkshire Members know that £3.5 million extra has been spent on delivering the class size pledge. Devon Members will be aware that the figure there is a little below that, at slightly under £3 million. That real money has allowed the expansion of 1,600 popular schools where parents will find more places. That will increase parental preference and ensure that more children have access to successful popular schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has given a clear exposition of the Government's intentions in relation to the supplemental regulations in part III of the order. She has given a number of important assurances.<br><br>
However, the Minister has not answered one of my queries. Will she give a clear explanation of how the Secretary of State may vary conditions under regulation 9(3)? Hopefully, she will give the same assurances to schools that she did in relation to other provisions in the order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Estelle Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will be corrected, if I am wrong.<br><br>
We will vary conditions of the plan only in consultation with local authorities. We will maintain a relationship with local authorities, as we seek implementation of the plan. In agreement with them—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In agreement?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, we will find better ways of implementing the plan in agreement with local authorities. Much of regulation 9 applies to misspent money.<br><br>
I will clarify matters, lest I am quoted in future. The hon. Member for Bath will know from his long experience in politics that sometimes two parties do not agree initially. However, negotiation and a common goal helps those parties to reach an eventual agreement. I do not envisage major changes to the plans that we have agreed. I do not see the point. I hope that I have reassured him that we would not impose such changes, now that plans have been agreed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Browning</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister respond to my earlier point about 4,308 new teachers being funded by the grant? Are those teachers being employed on teachers' normal terms and conditions of employment or are they on short-term contracts?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Estelle Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to give the hon. Lady an assurance that those teachers are being employed on normal teaching contracts, not on short-term contracts.<br><br>
Politicians from all parties have agreed that class size matters, even if we deny the means to achieve our aims. So it would be perverse to vote against regulations allowing money to be passed to local authorities to build classrooms and employ teachers. I hope that the regulations will gain the approval of every Committee member, so that we can ensure the improvement of children's education.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be churlish of me not to say how grateful Harrogate's five primary schools are for the new build that they are getting. They are excellent, and I am sure that schools that did not get new build this year will get it next year.<br><br>
There is great anxiety in North Yorkshire—especially Harrogate—about the valuable work of classroom assistants. There is no mention of such assistants in the Government's pledge. However, the single status agreement has had a most disastrous effect in North Yorkshire. As a result of it, virtually every classroom assistant in Harrogate, along with library assistants and assistants helping special needs children, have had their terms and conditions varied and their pay reduced by 25 per cent.<br><br>
I accept that the regulations are not directly concerned with such matters. However, will the Minister examine what is happening in North Yorkshire and assure some of the most poorly paid people in education that they are a valuable resource and will be properly appreciated? The Government must ensure that assistants' pay is not cut and that their conditions are not varied as a result of the single status agreement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his comments about money being well spent in his constituency. I agree about the importance of classroom assistants.<br><br>
I had a notion that I could be accused of deploying the regulations to use classroom assistants rather than teachers to reduce class sizes. Classroom assistants are probably best left out of the regulations. However, I will take the opportunity to announce again the 20,000 extra classroom assistants announced by the Prime Minister at conference. The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough already knows about that pledge.<br><br>
Our commitment on funding for extra classroom assistants and on their pay and conditions has led us to embark on recommendations contained in the Green Paper on reform in the teaching profession. We have asked the Qualification and Curriculum Authority to examine classroom assistants' qualifications, so that there is a semblance of order about such matters and so that people have a ladder of opportunity to progress through the profession. The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough is right: I am not directly responsible for the single-status agreement
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0222">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
and the employment of classroom assistants, but given the importance of their role in schools we will keep a watching brief on the matter.<br><br>
I hope that the Committee will support the regulations.</span></p>
<p>11.19am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. May</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. I am grateful for the Minister's categorical assurance that the Government will not require the repayment of grant to local education authorities in respect of the approved plans to reduce class sizes. LEAs, too, will be grateful for that assurance.<br><br>
The Minister made some general comments about infant class sizes and said that the Government's implementation of the infant class size pledge means that parental choice is not restricted and that parents have an increased choice. The reality is different: as a result of the pledge, children are being turned away from infant classes in schools that their parents want them to attend.<br><br>
In response to my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton the Minister said that some rural schools were not getting money for capital grant because they were using existing space and not building new classrooms. That is another problem. Schools may have space that they can use as
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
classrooms but often it is space that has been used as a music room or a library. Thus schools are losing out in implementing the class size pledge.<br><br>
The on-going problem for local education authorities is that although there may be an initial grant for the extra teachers required to fulfil the pledge, it was clear from the Minister's reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton that those teachers are employed not on short-term contracts under grant funding but on the normal terms and conditions of employment. When the grant runs out, the education authority is faced with the responsibility of having to match the education budget to the needs of those extra teachers. I am worried about the on-going costs to schools of servicing the new buildings and continuing to employ teachers, which go beyond the extent of the grant.<br><br>
The pledge is not being implemented without it having a practical, and in some cases, adverse, impact on schools. As we said during the passage of the School Standards and Framework Bill, rather than rigidly imposing a limit of 30 to a class we want the Government to implement the proposal with greater flexibility and allow local decisions to be taken. Sadly, the Government set their face against our suggestion and children and parents are losing out as a result.</span></p>
