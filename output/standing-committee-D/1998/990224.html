	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Health (Mr. John Denham)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><q><p>That the Committee has considered the draft National Health Service Estate Management and Health Building Agency Trading Fund Order 1999.</p></q>
National Health Service Estates is an executive agency of the Department of Health, which employs approximately 260 staff at its head office in Leeds, in the eight regional offices of the NHS Executive and in eight other office locations. It has an annual turnover of approximately £13 million. The agency is a firmly established member of the NHS family, and its primary function is to be the centre of excellence and knowledge for the health care estate. Its customers respect it highly for its breadth of expertise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The four principal activities of NHS Estates are identified in its framework document. First, the agency advises and supports Ministers and the NHS Executive through the development and implementation of policies, strategies and systems for the cost-effective management, maintenance and use of the estate in the NHS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the agency supports the NHS Executive regional offices. Regional teams assist with the performance management of NHS trusts, review business-cases for capital investment and provide advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the agency manages and disposes of surplus NHS property that is owned by the Secretary of State. Its estate professionals have the expertise to maximise the disposal income while delivering savings in holding and disposal costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, the agency provides advice, guidance and support for NHS organisations, including bespoke consultancy, property and project services, training, technical information and guidance, and software.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should remind hon. Members of the agency's history. Policy and consultancy work relating to the NHS estate was orginally handled by the health buildings directorate of the Department of Health. The National Health Service Estate Management and Health Building Agency, to give it its full title, was established as a next steps agency in 1991. It was felt that the greater managerial freedoms afforded by agency status would improve responsiveness to the increasing and diverse needs of the NHS, and allow delivery of more demanding performance targets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
NHS Estates has made a number of significant improvements in its performance since it was set up in 1991, the most notable of which is the delivery without loss of quality of a £4 million reduction in the annual cost of delivering the service requirements of Ministers and the Department of Health. The agency has consistently delivered its key tasks and targets and is justly proud of its achievements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consideration has been given to whether the work of the agency would be more efficiently and effectively delivered in the private sector. In July 1997, the Government confirmed that NHS Estates would retain its status in the public sector. The agency is a firmly established member of the NHS family, and NHS Estates will play a full and active part in implementing the Government's vision for a modern NHS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 1 April 1998, NHS Estates acquired Capitec, a trading agency that was formerly the estates advisory organisation attached to the Bath mental health care NHS trust. Capitec provides expert estates advice and support for NHS trusts in a consultancy capacity. The merger has achieved a synergy between managerial and technical skills to support the NHS nationally in delivering optimum use of the estate for better health care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should now like to say something about the funding of the agency. When it was first set up as an agency, NHS Estates operated under a gross cost control regime. Its expenditure level was voted by Parliament and its receipts were appropriated in aid. Under that regime, the agency did not charge the NHS or its Executive directly for the services that it provided. The arrangement had an obvious disadvantage, in that individual NHS customers were unable to order specific services that they required. Instead, they had either to rely on a service that the agency was able to provide within the constraints of its general responsibilities and overall capacity, or to go eslewhere at an additional cost to the NHS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To improve the agency's efficiency and increase responsiveness to its customers' needs, two things happened. First, over time, resources allocated to pay for NHS property advice were transferred from the Department of Health vote to the NHS vote. In effect, customers were given the necessary resources to buy the property services that they needed from the source of their choice. NHS Estates now had to compete with other private sector suppliers for business. Hitherto, it had been the sole supplier and had enjoyed a guaranteed income. I am pleased to say that NHS Estates met the challenge head on and continues to be the main source of property advice to the national health service. Secondly, NHS Estates changed to its current financial regime of net running cost control on 1 April 1996. Under that regime, the agency charges for its services and is required to cover its costs by receipts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government believe, however, that the establishment of NHS Estates as a trading fund will give it a more flexible financial regime, and will enable it to continue to improve the way it manages its affairs. Hon. Members will be aware that trading fund status
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0559">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
provides the closest analogy to a commercial operation that is available within government. I should emphasise at the outset, however, that there is no question of setting NHS Estates a financial target that will require it to make excessive surpluses. That would be entirely inappropriate for a public body that acts as a professional adviser to the NHS Executive and the NHS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a trading fund, NHS Estates will operate off-vote, and the usual Treasury cash limit and virement controls will cease to apply. Consequently, it will be able to adjust all its expenditure—not just its running costs—to meet variations in demand and therefore income. Such additional flexibility will be particularly valuable given the difficulty of accurately predicting the level of advice required by the NHS in any one year and, therefore, the resources needed. As a trading fund, NHS Estates will continue to build on the excellent links that it has with the Department and Ministers. The Department will continue to obtain the advice it requires from NHS Estates through a service and financial framework, which will be unaffected by the move to trading fund status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More generally, a trading-fund will establish NHS Estates as a separate body set up under statute, which will place day-to-day responsibility for managing the fund on the chief executive and her team. External controls will be restricted to essential strategic matters, notably the agency's external financing limit and its financial and performance targets. Experience has shown that, in suitable cases, next step agencies becoming trading funds can lead to significant improvements in efficiency and effectiveness to the benefit of customers, taxpayers and staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members should be advised that in accordance with the requirements of the Government Trading Funds Act 1973, as amended, staff and major customers have been given an opportunity to make representations concerning the Government's proposal to establish NHS Estates as a trading fund. No objections were expressed, and the responses were generally supportive of the Government's proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will also want to know what policy the Government propose in respect of fees and the financial and other performance targets that will be set. NHS Estates' financial target for 1998–99 is to break even in cash and income and expenditure terms, after making a 5 per cent, efficiency saving. The cost of work done for the Department in support of the policy and performance management is negotiated before the beginning of each year according to specified outputs and efficiency savings. Work for NHS trusts and wider markets is costed according to a pricing policy, which is written in accordance with the Treasury fees and charges guide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Assuming that the order is approved, NHS Estates will be set a financial objective that will require the fund to earn an operating surplus. This will be about £270,000 over a three-year period before interest. A financial objective requiring a return on NHS Estates capital employed is not appropriate as it owns a few assets. Costs are not expected to increase because the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
objective is a fair reflection of the operating surpluses forecast to be made by NHS Estates in the next three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To turn to the order itself, article 1 indicates that the operative date will be 1 April 1999 to coincide with the start of the financial year. Article 2 covers the operations that will be funded from the revenues of the fund. Those operations are described more fully in schedule I, and comprise all the activities currently carried out by NHS Estates. Article 3 provides that NHS Estates' loans, and any subsequent loans, will be provided from the Department of Health vote. Article 4 and schedule II describe the assets and liabilities that are to be transferred to the fund on 1 April 1999. Article 4 also provides that half the capital needed to fund the excess of assets over liabilities should be provided in the form of public dividend capital, the other half being loans from the Department of Health. Finally, article 5 puts a limit of £3 million on NHS Estates' total borrowing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
NHS Estates has achieved significant improvements in performance in recent years. However, we are convinced that the additional flexibility available to it as a trading fund will enable it to achieve even greater improvements in its planning and performance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.40 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Philip Hammond 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Runnymede and Weybridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This matter does not give the Opposition any great problems in principle, nor will the measure have a significant impact on the operation of the NHS at the sharp end, which is the bit that matters to most people. However, I want the Minister to clarify a couple of points. In his opening statement he made me more confused that I was before. I shall come to that in a moment and ask him to clarify what is covered by schedule I, because there appears to be a discrepancy between that provision and the agency's overall functions outlined by the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister clarify whether, in regard to maintaining effective parliamentary scrutiny of the fund's activites, there is a mechanism in place that provides for regular reports to Parliament and regular presentation of the accounts? Will he also confirm that the more flexible financial regime to which he referred will not include the ability to borrow, other than from the Secretary of State? I think that that is the case, but I should be grateful if the Minister could confirm it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am more confused that I was before about the operations covered by the order. The Minister said that the agency has four functions—giving advice on policy and strategy to Ministers, carrying out disposals of surplus property for the Secretary of State, giving advice to regional offices and giving assistance to health service bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule I shows only three items. The first is advice and support to Ministers in the development of policies; the second is assistance to any health service body; and the third is any incidental or ancillary operations thereto. I read the schedule initially as meaning that only the parts of the agency's operations listed in schedule I were to be transferred to the fund, but I understand from what the Minister said that the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0560">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
whole of the agency's operation will be transferred. Can he explain why schedule I contains no reference to the agency's function in acting for the Secretary of State in disposals or to its function of giving advice to regional offices of the NHS Executive?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear from paragraph (2) of the order that the Secretary of State considers that the operations being transferred to the fund
	<br><q><p>"consist substantially in the provision of goods or services in the United Kingdom otherwise than to departments of Her Majesty's Government".</p></q>
In the Minister's list, those functions include the supply of services to Departments of Her Majesty's Government or agencies of those Departments. It is important for us to understand how the agency's Current activities are split between advice given to the Secretary of State, Ministers, the Department of Health centrally and NHS regional offices, and advice given to NHS bodies such as trusts and health authorities, and also the part of the agency's function that relates to disposals of property on behalf of the Secretary of State. That is clearly an area of concern, because it is where the agency's work comes most directly in competition with private sector bodies. I hope that the Minister will clarify the situation, which is confusing to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister shed more light on the consultation process? The order states:
	<br><q><p>"The Secretary of State … has … taken such steps as appear to him appropriate to give an opportunity to such persons as appear to him appropriate to make representations to him and has, in accordance with section 6(4) of that Act, laid before Parliament a report about the representations received and his conclusions."</p></q>
That report, which consists of a minute on half a sheet of paper, states that the agency—not the Secretary of State—has consulted its customers, which it did by telephone. It also states that all the queries that were raised during that telephone consultation exercise "were satisfactorily addressed", and that
	<br><q><p>"the responsible Minister has expressed himself satisfied with the level of consultation and its outcome".</p></q>
Is that the process of consultation, reporting and parliamentary scrutiny that the drafters of the original legislation had in mind? Does the Minister really think that customers are the only "appropriate … persons" who need to be consulted? The Government agency is moving closer to being in an arm's length relationship with the bodies that it works for, and to having a commercial structure. Might not the associations that represent the professions and the private sector entities with which it competes—or might compete—also be appropriate consultees? Does he think that telephone consultation is an adequate form of consultation? The legislation states that a report on representations received must be made to Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report contains no details of the representations or queries that were received, or of anything else. Obviously, it could not contain them—representations and comments were not solicited in writing or in a form that could be reported to Parliament, as the legislation requires. Is the Minister entirely satisfied
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
that that is consistent with the spirit of section 6(4) of the Government Trading Funds Act 1973? Does he really feel, on reflection, that his Department's report—all 17 lines of it—is adequate for the purposes of parliamentary scrutiny?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is fortunate that the matter before the Committee is broadly uncontroversial. Should we not, as parliamentarians who are charged with the scrutiny of legislation, insist, as a matter of principle, that the spirit of reporting requirements should be complied with in full? That would allow us—the scrutineers—to establish, on a properly informed basis, our view of the merits of secondary legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Evan Harris 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Oxford, West and Abingdon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have two questions for the Minister. First, on the consultation process, what was the view of the trade union that represents the staff who work for the estates agency? Was it formally consulted or were staff members approached? Secondly, does the proposal suggest that the Government ruled out the agency's privatisation for the duration of this Parliament?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Joan Walley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to flag up one point of concern, on which I hope the Minister will comment. The Select Committee on Environmental Audit, of which I am a member, recommended that we should not treat environmental issues as a bolt-on extra, and that we should consider the questions of sustainability before embarking on any policy. Although we may not have precise knowledge about the agency's functions, will the Minister include procurement and environmental sustainability among the new framework's performance targets? Although I am aware that that is not spelt out in black and white, it would help the Committee to be reassured that environmental issues will not be bolted on and that they will influence decision making from the outset, after 1 April.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) said about consultation and, in particular, paragraph (1)(ii) of schedule 1. I am anxious that, when we give a public sector body commercial freedom, which I favour in principle, we do not disadvantage private sector competitors. Are there any competitors? If so, why have they not made representations? The only representations were made by customers. Who are those customers? Do they include private finance initiative contractors? What is their opinion of the proposal? It seems non-contentious, but I should like to be reassured that the new operators in the health market are content with what the Minister is suggesting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Gentleman was correct to say that the only source of borrowing available to the agency is the Department of Health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked about the extent of consultation. It is for me, as the Minister responsible, to decide what consultation is necessary under the curcumstances. The vast majority of the agency's customers are internal—they are within the NHS. We had to decide on the appropriate consultation in case the changes had a major impact on customers. It would cost a great deal of time and money to go through a major consultation exercise on a measure that is—the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge put his finger on it—broadly uncontroversial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general response from customers—I apologise if this is not in the report—was surprise that someone had bothered to ring them up on an issue that would not affect anyone. I was satisfied that the exercise was adequate. Had issues arisen from the telephone consultation, we would have had to decide whether a more extensive operation was necessary. I judged that it was not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked about the competitive position of the trading fund. In some cases, it will operate in direct competition with the private sector. For those parts of its business the price is set in accordance with Treasury guidance, which is subject to wider discussion elsewhere in the House. We shall follow that policy and the step towards trading fund status is reasonable. Department of Health work is covered through the service agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A question was asked about the scope of the work concerned. The split is broadly 40 per cent, on Department of Health work, which includes advice to Ministers, and 60 per cent, on trusts and other NHS bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should clarify the position of the residual estate. Ownership of the estate is not being passed to the trading fund. The fund will operate for a management fee and will advise and carry out functions on behalf of the Secretary of State. Until disposed of, ownership of the residual estate remains with the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised at the percentage split quoted by the Minister because paragraph (2) states that the Secretay of State has determined:
	<br><q><p>"that the operations in question consist substantially in the provision of goods or services"</p></q>
other than to Departments of Her Majesty's Government. I was expecting him to tell us that the percentage of the agency's turnover related to dealings directly with the Department of Health was rather smaller than that, but I suppose that one could interpret 60 per cent, as being substantial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
The Minister referred in his opening comments to the agency's activity in carrying out disposals on behalf of the Secretary of State, but that was not apparent to me from reading the document. Will that activity be included in the activities transferred to the fund and, if so, which part of schedule 1 covers that activity?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can confirm that, from 1 April 1999, the date at which the trading fund will be established, any NHS estates will assume responsibility and accountability for disposal of the retained estate. That transfer will take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the drafting of schedule 1, I am assured that all the functions set out in my speech are covered by it. Paragraph (1)(i) states:
	<br><q><p>"advice and support to Ministers the development and implementation of policies, strategies and systems for the cost effective management, maintenance and use of the estate in the NHS".</p></q>
Paragraph (1)(ii) states:
	<br><q><p>"assistance to any health service body … to secure maximum value for money from both capital investment and revenue expenditure".</p></q>
Both those functions would cover the situation in which ownership of the estate remains, as I made clear, with the Secretary of State, with the NHS acting in a management capacity, effectively advising and carrying out disposal of the estate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that there is a point of substance. To be helpful to the Committee, in my opening speech I separated the functions into four. The parliamentary draftsmen decided to cover those four functions in three sub-paragraphs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have covered the point raised by the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Mr. Luff) on the commercial competitive activities of the trading fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) asked two questions. The first was whether there had been full consultation with staff and unions. The answer is yes, and no objections were raised to the process. I know that there was a second question, but I must ask the hon. Gentleman to remind me what it was.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I read nothing into the Minister's failure to remember my question. I asked whether that step meant that the Government have ruled out privatisation of the agency for the whole of the current Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We announced on 31 July that the agency status would remain in the public sector, and there are no plans to revisit that decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Ms Walley) asked about sustainable management of the estate. That is a legitimate question to put to the NHS and the Department of Health. How we handle our buildings is an issue that we can perhaps discuss at length on another day. NHS Estates provides a service to those responsible for making sure that the buildings are managed or land disposed of. It certainly, as I understand it, has the capacity to provide the right sort of policy advice, if commissioned to do so. The assurance that I can give today is that, as
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0562">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
a professionally run body, it is capable of providing that advice to the component parts of the national health service. Perhaps we can return to the question of whether it always commissions advice on that basis at a later date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I take one minute of the Committee's time? I have listened carefully to what the Minister said about the functions covered in schedule I and I want to place it on the record that I do not think that the explanation is adequate. The operation of a commercial estate agency business to carry out disposals by the agency on behalf of the Secretary of State does not appear to be covered in Schedule I. It cannot be covered by paragraph (1)(ii), because that relates to assistance to "any health service body"—that is, trusts and authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The NHS estate that comes up for disposal is in the hands of the Secretary of State. It cannot be covered in a transparently obvious way in paragraph (1)(i), which refers to advice and support in the development of policies, strategies and systems. I do not see where the disposal of parts of the estate comes in. Would it have been clearer if that specific and easily identifiable function of NHS Estates had been set out as an operation that was clearly transferred to the fund by the order? Many members of the Committee may, like myself, have read the order and, knowing a little about the work that NHS Estates does, have understood it as only partially transferring the agency's work to the fund, perhaps leaving some residual parts with the agency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with what the hon. Gentleman has said, because all too often legislation is not as readable in its raw form as we would like it to be. When the skills of the parliamentary draftsmen are brought to bear, they often produce something that is considerably more terse and compressed than the words that we might use when speaking about a subject in debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am assured that the brief to parliamentary counsel and the response adequately cover all the functions of NHS Estates as a trading fund that are necessary in law. The fact that it is not listed as a separate activity arises from the way in which it has been drafted rather than from an attempt to conceal the function from the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In summary, NHS Estates has a significant role in delivering expert advice and support to Ministers and the NHS Executive. It is rightly proud of its role in delivering the Government's agenda for the NHS. Achieving a modern, dependable national health service will need NHS Estates' professionals to shape new policies and help to implement them. In delivering those services, NHS Estates will focus on its primary function as the centre of excellence and knowledge for the health care estate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To achieve those objectives, NHS Estates needs the operational flexibility to respond quickly and effectively to changes in customer demand and the environment. Trading fund status is the most appropriate means of providing that flexibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
