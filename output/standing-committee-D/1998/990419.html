	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department (Mr. Geoffrey Hoon)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><q><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Civil Procedure (Modification of Enactments) Order 1999.</p></q>
The most fundamental reform of the civil justice system for more than 100 years will come into effect on 26 April. The reforms aim to provide a single system of civil justice based on the fundamental principles of proportionality, clarity and efficiency. The civil procedure rules that will come into force on that day are a key aspect of the reforms—a new unified code of civil procedure to implement the expressed objectives of the new system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other steps to be taken in this process of reform which, although comparatively minor, still make an important contribution to the achievement of the modernisation of the civil justice system. One step is the implementation of the Civil Procedure (Modification of Enactments) Order 1999, which is before the Committee today. The order is made under section 4(2) of the Civil Procedure Act 1997, the Act that provided the machinery for the reform of civil procedure. It established the civil procedure rule committee and gave it the task of drafting the new rules of court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the 1997 Act was passed, it was recognised that certain aspects of the reforms might conflict with existing provisions of primary legislation. At the time, Parliament recognised that some changes of substance might be necessary to make the new reforms effective. However, it rightly wanted an opportunity to debate the changes before they were made. Section 4(2) of the 1997 Act therefore permits the Lord Chancellor, by order, to make amendments to primary legislation to facilitate the making of civil procedure rules. The orders, such as that before the Committee today, are subject to the affirmative resolution procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments made by the order to primary legislation are small but significant. The order amends section 11 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990. Section 11 permits the Lord Chancellor, by order, to provide that there shall be no restriction on the persons who may exercise rights of audience, or rights to conduct litigation, in relation to proceedings in a county court. That power is restricted to the types of proceedings listed in section 11(2). Section 11(2)(e) currently provides that the power is exercisable in respect of proceedings
	<br><q><p>"referred to arbitration in accordance with county court rules made under section 64 of the County Courts Act 1984 (small claims)".</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
These are currently the only proceedings for which an order allowing lay representation in county court proceedings has been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The civil procedure rules have moved away from treating small claims cases in county courts as if they had been referred to arbitration. It is fiction now to think of small claims as arbitration. Article 3 of the draft order amends section 11(2) of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 by referring to small claims inst ead of arbitration. That will reflect the new rules and allow the current, successful practice of permitting lay representation in small claims cases to continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other amendment that is proposed is to the Civil Evidence Act 1995. That Act made new provisions for the admissibility of hearsay evidence and the proof of documentary evidence in civil cases. Before the implementation of the 1995 Act, the law on hearsay evidence was governed by the Civil Evidence Act 1968, which contained an elaborate system of notices and counternotices to enable parties to adduce hearsay evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parliament greatly simplified the procedures in the 1995 Act by providing that hearsay evidence should generally be admissible in civil proceedings and by providing for notification to be given to the other parties in accordance with rules of court. Section 16(3) of the Act provided that transitional provisions could be contained in the commencement order but, subject to any such provisions, the Act would not apply to cases begun before the commencement of the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Act was brought into force on 31 January 1997 but, by an oversight, the power to provide transitional provisions was not exercised in the commencement order. As a result, cases commenced before that date were not brought under the new Act and had to continue to apply the cumbersome and expensive provisions of the 1968 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part 33 of the Civil Procedure Rules 1998 contains the mechanism for the admissibility of hearsay evidence under the 1995 Act. The amendment proposed in article 4 of the draft order allows for rules of court or practice directions to make transitional provisions for the application of the Act to cases commenced before 31 January 1997. It is intended that such provision will be made and thus provide that there will be only one set of rules for hearsay in all cases. That will be beneficial, and the regime that the uniform rules will apply will be simpler and more economical for litigants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have given sufficient explanation of why the various provisions of the order are necessary. Together, they will help achieve the objectives of the civil justice reforms. I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.35 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Garnier 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harborough)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I begin by welcoming you to the Chair, Dr. Clark. I declare an interest: I am a practising member of the Bar. Article 3 of the order should not affect my practice, but article 4 may from time to time have some bearing on my work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we see from the explanatory notes, the order makes two changes—first, to section 11 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990; and, secondly, to the commencement
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0081">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
provisions of the Civil Evidence Act 1995, so as to enable that Act and the Civil Procedure Rules 1998 to apply to cases begun before 31 January 1997.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 11(2)(e) of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 is to be changed. Subsection (1) states:
	<br><q><p>"The Lord Chancellor may by order provide that there shall be no restriction"</p></q>
on who may appear as an advocate or who may conduct litigation in county court proceedings of certain categories. Subsection (2)(e) includes small claims cases. On reading the draft order and the Act, I was not sure why the change was needed, but the Minister has assisted me, at least in part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of more concern is the fact that section 11(10) of the 1990 Act states that
	<br><q><p>"Before making any order"—</p></q>
such as the one now being debated—
	<br><q><p>"the Lord Chancellor shall consult the Senior Presiding Judge."</p></q>
Given the Lord Chancellor's record for consultation, and given the Minister's inability to keep a check on the Lord Chancellor's demands for ever more executive power over the courts—such as the extermination of the Advisory Committee on Legal Education and Conduct under the Access to Justice Bill—it is entirely right that the Minister should tell us when the Lord Chancellor consulted the Senior Presiding Judge, and to identify that judge; and whether he did so orally or in writing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister publish his letter of consultation or provide us with a written memorandum of any oral consultation and any relevant replies? Will he assure the Committee that he personally ensured that the consultation process was properly conducted and was in line with the judgment of Mr. Justice Webster in the case of The Crown v. the Secretary of State for Social Services, ex parte The Association of Metropolitan Authorities, reported on page 1, volume 1 of the Weekly Law Reports, 1986?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that the provision on consultation is mandatory, it follows that for there to have been consultation with the meaning of that word in the 1990 Act, there must have been a genuine request for advice and a genuine desire to receive it. Will the Minister assure the Committee that the Senior President Judge was not placed under any time restrictions for his reply or given inadequate time in which to consider the Lord Chancellor's? request for advice, and that he was given all the necessary information upon which to base his advice to the Lord Chancellor?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister assure the Committee that he has considered not only Mr. Justice Webster's judgment but those in the cases of Fletcher v. The Minister of town and Country Planning, reported in the second volume of the All England Law Reports of 1947; of Rollo v. The Minister of Town and Country Planning, reported in the first volume of the All England Law Reports of 1948; of the Union of Whippingham and East Cowes Benefices, Derham v. The Church Commissioners for England, reported in the Appeal Cases Reports of 1954; and of The Agricultural, Horticultural and Forestry Training Board v. Aylesbury Mushrooms Ltd., reported in the first volume of the Weekly Law Reports of 1972?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those cases are all about deeply esoteric matters, but, if the Minister is doing his job properly, I have no doubt that he will have considered them so that he could come
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
to a view about whether the Lord Chancellor had gone through the proper consultation process under section 11(10) of the 1990 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 4 of the order relates to section 16 of the Civil Evidence Act 1995. Section 16(3) will be changed in quite a major way, although I understand that the change is required because of an oversight. At the moment, the Act does not apply to proceedings begun before the commencement date of the Act—31 January 1997. The order will make it possible to apply the Act to proceedings begun before that date. In short, hearsay and documentary evidence will not be excluded in cases begun before 31 January 1997.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 5.1 of the Law Commission's 1991 consultation paper No. 117, entitled "The Hearsay Rule in Civil Proceedings", states:
	<br><q><p>"There can be little doubt that the rule excluding hearsay is the most confusing of the rules of evidence, posing difficulties for courts, practitioners and witnesses alike."</p></q>
No one quite knows when the rule against hearsay was introduced, but whenever it was, it has been eroded piecemeal by statue ever since. With the increased keeping of official written records and electronically retrievable information systems, the reliability and public availability of documentary evidence that can technically amount to hearsay has increased. Its accuracy is no longer always a source of worry. In practical terms, there is no reason why cases begun before 31 January 1997 should not be subject to the same regime—subject to proper judicial safeguards—as cases begun after that date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When will the Minister published the draft rules referred to in article 4(b)? If the Minister can assure me of his personal attention to the matters that I raised in relation to article 3, I anticipate that the order will shortly be passed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I should like to ask the Ministers about two related matters. First, the explanatory note refers to civil procedure rules, in particular those of 1998. The Minister began his remarks this afternoon by referring to the earth-shattering events of 26 April, which flow from the reforms designed by the Master of the Rolls, Lord Woolf. Is the Minister aware that, despite the fact that the Woolf reforms will come into force on 26 April, no new claim forms are available in the Leicester county court? Will he ensure that all necessary court forms are available in every county court? 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> It is the Minster's business: it is the responsibility of his Department. If he is going to snigger about the great big reforms that he is introducing, he is even more unfit to do his job that others have thought until now. It is no good the Minister sniggering and being lazy; this is a most important matter—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Listen to them Dr. Clark; they have no idea about the importance of the reforms that will come into effect next week. Leicester is just one example of a county court in which claim forms are not available. They should be available in time for 26 April, and the Minister should be able to assure the Committee that they will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the court service's software for drawing up court orders does not allow for more than one defendant. A solicitor in my constituency who was acting for a plaintiff against several defendants in the Leicester district registry was this morning unable to have an order drawn up by the court against anyone in addition to the first
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0082">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
defendant, as the computer could not allow for that. It was not possible even to identify, let alone enumerate, the second and subsequent defendants in that unit order. Such matters may be of no importance to most members of this Committee, but I assure you, Dr. Clark, that the order will be laughed out of court if the real substance behind the Woolf reforms cannot be brought into practical effect. I invite the Minister to comment as soon as possible on my final points as well as on those that I made earlier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.44 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Burnett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Torridge and West Devon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome you to the Chair of the Committee, Dr. Clark, and I, too, must declare an interest, in that I am a partner in a law firm, but will shortly cease to be a partner and will sever my links with that firm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are debating the introduction of a small element of the civil justice procedural reforms arising from Lord Woolf s 1996 "Access to Justice" report. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the excellent work done by Lord Woolf and his team. We support most of the Woolf recommendations and are anxious to see them implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The points that I wish to make are more general, but they are pertinent to the debate. The Woolf reforms, which are substantial, significant and far-reaching, should be implemented in a reasonable time and not piecemeal. There must be sufficient investment in personnel training and information technology to make the reforms work. The timetable imposed by the Government is far too limited and too pressured.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new rules are largely welcome, but they involve a complete change in the way in which civil proceedings will be conducted. For example, at long last, there will be one rule book and one set of rules for High Court and county court work. The development of a less adversarial culture is encouraging and it will lead to disputing parties resolving their differences by negotiation rather than proceedings. It should lead to the expedition of proceedings, especially fast-track cases with a limited timetable and streamlined procedures. There will be far greater judicial supervision and case management by courts and judges, which will involve, as Lord Woolf said, substantial investment in information technology.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The changes, which are being made not before time, involve a welcome revolution in the administration of civil justice in this country. There must be time for judges, court staff, litigants and lawyers to become conversant with the plethora of new material. As Lord Woolf clearly envisaged, the new rules should be introduced as a package. The new material and procedure rules are enormous tomes, which were published in their final form only in January 1999. How can all the parties—judges, litigants, lawyers and lay people—gear up their precedents, update their information technology and train their staff or themselves in three months? Partners in law firms will have to read, consider and in the detail of the far-reaching reforms before they start their take in-house training—it is even more difficult for the layman who is involved in litigation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
The timetable is too short and should be extended by some months so that the package can be introduced as a whole, rather than piecemeal. I hope that the Government will listen to my plea and that of other interested parties, such as the Law Society and the Bar Council. Piecemeal change is so unsatisfactory. In the transitional period, people will be unsure as to which rules prevail. There will be two rule books, each of which will have to be consulted, which will lead to confusion and time wasting. Complicated transitional rules will result in delay and further increased costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are far-reaching changes in the working practices of the civil courts in our country. Will the Government listen to and heed the views of nearly everyone with knowledge and expertise in these matters? Will they allow more time to introduce the changes as a package rather than in a piecemeal and unsatisfactory fashion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett). I am in possession of the two large tomes—as described by the hon. Gentleman—of the new rules. They take some understanding and it will be an almighty rush to get all lawyers up to speed by 26 April. It is all very well saying that matters should have been put in hand earlier, but the documents were not available until about three or four weeks ago. As the hon. Gentleman has said, a lot of work needs to be done in a short time. I declare an interest as a practising barrister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was some sniggering on the Government Benches about the valid point on forms raised by the hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Gamier). Without forms, there is no access to justice, so it is important that they are in place by the 26 April, otherwise the system will collapse completely. However, I welcome the general thrust of the Woolf reports, which represent a streamlined and sensible approach. Many parts of the civil justice system have, I am afraid, fallen into disrepute over the past few years, and the reports are largely welcome, especially because of the time limits set—reference has already been made to the fast track.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I broadly welcome the changes, of which the order is a minor part. I also welcome the extension of lay representation to the small claims sector and the unification of such matters. Furthermore, many people thought that the provisions on hearsay evidence in the Civil Evidence Act 1968 were unnecessarily complicated. The new streamlining approach, of which the order is part, will have beneficial cost and time implications; it will provide simplicity for those who wish to do what they can without the assistance of lawyers.

All in all, I give the change a guarded welcome, although I sincerely echo what was said by the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon: much work has to be done in a short time, which was also mentioned by the hon. and learned Member for Harborough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a wide-ranging debate, and I shall endeavour to respond to all the various points that have been made. I presume that some poor pupil barrister

in the chambers of the hon. and learned Member for Harborough has spent the weekend researching the various cases that he mentioned. Sad to say, they are not strictly relevant to our debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gamier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unlike the Minsiter, who has a team of excellent civil servants, I do all my own work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is unfortunate as I was about to blame a pupil barrister, but the hon. and learned Gentleman seems unable to distinguish between the Executive and the legislature. He gave the example of the Lord Chancellor exercising executive power in relation to the proposed abolition of ACLEC, but that is, of course, the responsibility of the legislature, and it is before Parliament. The Lord Chancellor has no power to abolish ACLEC; it will be for Parliament to decide, and Parliament will debate it. It is important that Queen's counsel understand the difference between the Executive and legislature, and I am glad to have this opportunity to remind one of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Senior Presiding Judge, Lord Justice Judge, was fully consulted by way of a letter from an official in the Lord Chancellor's Department. That consultation was properly conducted. I am willing to place a copy of the official letter in the Library if that is necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft rules will be published this week in a practice direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the availability, or otherwise, of forms in Leicester county court and on their availability more generally, all the relevant forms have been available on the Lord Chancellor's Department's website for some time, as indeed are copies of the rules, so there is absolutely no reason why any practitioner should not have access to those rules and forms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Solihull)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How many litigants in person does the Minister honestly think have access to the Lord Chancellor's Department' s website?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot honestly answer that question. I am sure that the hon. Member for Solihull would not expect me to be able to do so, but, in my experience, litigants in person are among the most persistent people in finding out the relevant details of their cases. I am pretty confident that litigants in person will be able to secure those forms if they need them. If they cannot personally access the internet, I am sure—again, from my experience of them—that they will quickly find someone who can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon is right: it is important that the Woolf reforms should be implemented in reasonable time. I would have welcomed the hon. Gentleman's speech perhaps a year ago, but it is out of date because the rules have been available for some time. The process of developing them has fully involved
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
all the professions and the judiciary in consultations to ensure that there is a single set of rules. This is not an issue simply of imposing on the professions or anyone else a set of rules dreamt up in the Lord Chancellor's Department. The rules are the result of a long period of detailed discussion with all who are affected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that the rules in their final form were available to profession generally—not the esoteric leaders of the profession who have discussed these matters with the Lord Chancellor's Department—only since January this year?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hoon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, I suppose that it turns of the meaning of the word "available". Members of the profession have been encouraged to view the developing rules for a long time. They were posted on the internet, and the profession was invited to observe and to contribute. As the hon. Gentleman knows, many people who are not necessarily leaders of their professions are extremely expert in the matter of rules: Such people have made many valuable contributions that have been incorporated into the final published rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government wish to encourage a change in attitude and culture, not simply a mechanical change in the rules. Some members of the professions have perhaps resisted this and have been unwilling to participate. For this reason, the Government were keen to set a date and have the changes in place and operative by 26 April. Any further delay would be a risk to the impetus that has developed behind the change of approach. What is important is not the particular interest of certain members of the profession but the interest of all who are served by our justice system. It is important to have a speedy, cost-effective system that provides access to justice for everyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am confident that lawyers, if they had applied their mind from January, would by now be fully aware of the final proposals. I hope that I shall not receive a suggestion on the evening of 25 April to the effect that as lawyers have not consulted the rules until the night before their implementation, that is somehow a reason for further delay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All members of staff have received at least two days' full training. Lord Woolf himself has stated publicly his satisfaction that the introduction of the rules will not be accompanied by some sort of big bang but will be phased in, with the relevant technology.
