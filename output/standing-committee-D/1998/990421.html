Draft of Alterations to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Paul Boateng)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft of alterations to the criminal injuries compensation scheme.</p></blockquote>
May I say at the outset that it is a pleasure to appear before you in Committee, Mr. Jones. It is the first time for a number of us and we appreciate the wisdom and experience that you bring to the subject.<br><br>
The criminal injuries compensation scheme was first introduced in 1964, initially as a common law scheme. For the first 32 years it operated as a non-statutory scheme, compensation being assessed on the basis of common law damages. The statutory scheme was introduced in 1996 and compensation is now assessed on the basis of a tariff or scale of awards for injuries of comparable severity.<br><br>
The scheme is important and provides payment at taxpayers' expense to the blameless victims of crimes of violence. It is a significant contribution to the feeling that we need to engender in society, that we are committed to people's safety and security and that when they suffer, innocently, as a result of crime, they should receive some form of recognition from the taxpayer.<br><br>
There was concern on both sides of the House that the scheme would suffer from the transition to a statutory scheme. That has not been so and it is now recognised as having been, on balance, a good move and one to which we are firmly wedded. All successful claimants receive awards according to a tariff of 25 bands ranging from £1,000 to £250,000. The tariff is set by reference to the awards made under the previous scheme. The current tariff lists more than 300 injury descriptions.<br><br>
Since the introduction of the tariff scheme, more than 140,000 tariff claims have been settled with speed, which is welcomed by all who make claims to the CICS, and tribute must be paid to the hard-working members of the board and their officials who enable that to happen.<br><br>
However, more than 240 claims cannot be settled because, although the injuries are serious enough to qualify for at least the minimum award, they are not listed in the tariff. That is why we brought the measure before the Committee this afternoon. We recognised that it was not fully comprehensive, that some less common injuries had inadvertently been omitted and that injury descriptions would need to be changed in the light of experience. The scheme, accordingly, provides for the Secretary of State to make provision for new injury descriptions and to introduce corresponding levels of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
awards, having first consulted with the Criminal Injuries Compensation Appeal Panel. That has been done and we invite Parliament to approve the necessary changes to the scheme by the affirmative resolution procedure.<br><br>
Meanwhile, hon. Members will be relieved to know that those who have suffered injury can receive an interim award of up to half the total sum. The Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority, with the CICAP, recommended an additional 49 injury descriptions to the tariff and they are shown in the explanatory note. The tariff is identical to the augmented tariff for which approval is being sought, but it is possible to identify those injuries for which we are seeking to obtain awards.<br><br>
We consider all the additions and award levels to be appropriate and we have taken the opportunity to make the tariff more consistent in its use of language and punctuation. That is important because it is vital that the scheme is understood as readily and easily as possible. We want to avoid lawyers having to be used—that will be welcome to you, Mr. Jones—and ordinary common sense should be sufficient in the main to secure a payment under the scheme, although lawyers will have to be used sometimes.<br><br>
The measure is limited and modest, but welcome, and I commend the draft alterations to the Committee.</span></p>
<p>4.34 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Greenway <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ryedale)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I reciprocate what the Minister said. It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair, Mr. Jones. Unlike the Minister, you and I have spent happy hours in the Rooms of the Committee corridor. We have always got on well, and I am sure that that will be the case this afternoon, although I doubt that we will be detained too long.<br><br>
Before our procedures were changed to bring measures subject to affirmative resolution to Committee, the scheme might have received a 90-minute debate on the Floor of the House. I know that hon. Members have other things to do, but the matter is sufficiently important for us to debate one or two aspects of it.<br><br>
We understand the rationale for the changes, which are, at face value, straightforward and unexceptional. We recognise the difficulty of settling outstanding claims when compensation is justified, and the minimum award of £1,000—or in some cases more—is appropriate. From what the Minister said, I suspect that a constituent of mine, whose husband tried to murder her, is one of the 240 outstanding claims. Although she has no permanent injuries, she suffered extreme psychological distress. The Criminal Injuries Compensation Board offered her £3,000, and under the changes in the draft scheme, it appears that that is what she will receive. However, I suspect that because there was no clear reference to that in the tariff, she thought that she would be entitled to more. We appreciate why it might make sense to add some injury descriptions to the tariff. It would help to facilitate settlement of some outstanding claims and provide greater clarity to ease similar claims in the future.<br><br>
It is worth dwelling on some of the examples given in the revised tariff. They include penetrating injuries to the the eyes that do not involve the permanent loss of the eye, fractures to facial bones, such as the jaw, which may or
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0595">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
may not require surgery or a result in permanent disability, the dislocation of limbs, including wrists, ankles, shoulders and knees, and damage to ligaments and tendons which may or may not result in continuing disability. We believe that in a tariff-based system, those injuries have a place in the most comprehensive tariff. I am sure that the Minister would not want to criticise the way in which the original tariff was set, but it was not envisaged that such items would be appropriate.<br><br>
All those injuries are commonplace, and frequently result from fights or assaults. Police officers often have such injuries. My son, who is a policeman, received a dislocated shoulder after trying to help someone who thought that he was going to arrest him, and he was off sick for some time. Such injuries occur when police officers make arrests or intervene during disorderly and violent conduct.<br><br>
Courts often make compensation awards to serving police officers in those circumstances, and the police service is concerned about the non-payment of those awards. The Police Federation estimates that about one third of them are not paid. Although the matter is outwith the scope of the CICB, I trust, Mr. Jones, that you will regard it as a worthy matter for consideration. The hon. Gentleman will know that the Police Federation is suggesting, in the interests of fairness and equity, that the police authorities might meet any unpaid grants. I urge the Minister to consider that. Some of the injuries suffered as a result of the nail bomb in Brixton last weekend may be in the same category as some of the injuries that we are adding to the list. That reflects the importance of this matter.<br><br>
We have no quibble with continuing to extend and improve the tariff-based system of criminal injuries compensation, which was introduced by the previous Government, as the Minister said, in 1995. It would be rich for him to expect me not to try to tease him a little about what his party said when that legislation was introduced. I merely refer the Committee to columns 741 to 750 of <i>Hansard</i> of 23 May 1995. The current Home Secretary moved an amendment and made an impassioned speech against the tariff-based system, which we are extending today. In addition, the Government's consultation paper on possible changes to the CICS—which we warmly welcome—is testament to how the responsibility of being in government takes precedence over whatever is said in opposition.<br><br>
The Government's assessment of the current scheme, as set out in the document, is about right. It is true that there was a small increase in expenditure for the board in the comprehensive spending review, but it was a small bump to meet outstanding claims. We have no quibble with that. It is fair to remind the Committee, however, that the previous Government were castigated for recognising that, under common law arrangements for awarding compensation, the £200 million annual cost of the scheme—which had grown from £400,000 in 1964—was projected to reach £570 million by 2000. That was one of the major reasons for the introduction of the tariff-based scheme by the previous Government, who rightly thought that that was unacceptable.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
We welcome the Minister's conversion—and that of his right hon. Friend—to a sensible basis for providing compensation for victims. It has the distinct advantage of certainty, which can make it easier to provide speedy compensation. I am sure that every Committee member would agree that that is a worthy objective. The Committee can also agree that this country has always had the most generous form of criminal injuries compensation in Europe. It is still a valid statistic that this country pays more to victims of crime than the other European Union countries put together, which we welcome. We are happy to agree with the Minister that the changes to the scheme are valuable, and we support their introduction. We look forward to discussing how to improve the lot of victims and their families in the future.</span></p>
<p>4.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Burnett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Torridge and West Devon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I too am delighted to join the Minister and the hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) in welcoming you as Chairman of this Committee, Mr. Jones. It is not the first Committee that you have chaired—I have served under you on a number of Committees dealing with legal affairs. I am happy to declare an interest as a partner in a firm of solicitors, although I shall leave the firm shortly.<br><br>
The review, which we welcome, is overdue, particularly given that the present tariff figures were set five or six years ago. We also welcome the fact that, as part of the review, the ambit of allowable claims is being reconsidered to add to the tariff injuries that are not currently listed. The Committee will know that, during the past five or six years, civil personal injury claims and damages have changed significantly, and there has been public criticism of some criminal injuries compensation awards. Currently, maximum common law damages can exceed £2 million, whereas the top criminal injuries compensation scheme award is £500,000.<br><br>
I shall give examples of the paucity of some awards. First, payouts of £5,000 have been made to relatives of fatal accident victims. The Committee will note that the Law Commission has recommended a complete overhaul of bereavement damages in civil cases. Many Committee members will agree that £5,000 is a niggardly sum. Secondly, a payment of £2,000 per year for loss of parental services bears no relation to the true value of parents' care and time, and goes but a little way towards covering replacement services.<br><br>
According to paragraph 45 of the consultation paper, a general uprating for inflation will, at the highest estimate, cost an extra £18 million. Committee members will note that, according to paragraph 26, the total payout under the scheme has been lower than anticipated, so it would make nonsense of the scheme for it not to be uprated regularly. Set against total Government spending and a budget surplus of about £7.4 billion, which was announced yesterday, the figure of £18 million is low, if not trivial.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0596">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
I shall deal briefly with the comprehensive spending review recommendations, about which I am concerned, and which are set out in paragraph 48 of the consultation paper. First, with regard to transferring to employers responsibility for attacks at work, many such employers work in the public sector, so payments will, in any event, be transferred from one Department of State to another. Employees of smaller or under-insured employers will be discriminated against.<br><br>
Secondly, removing public house-related crime from the scheme would, as the consultation paper itself envisages, lead to considerable difficulties of definition. Paragraph 50 of the consultation paper makes it clear that
<br><blockquote><p>"people legitimately and quietly enjoying themselves in a pub"</p></blockquote>
should not be excluded from the scheme. In practice, it will be difficult to establish who should or should not be excluded. The provision would also impact on younger and less wealthy people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I want to help the hon. Gentleman by asking him to relate his argument more specifically to the substance of the order, which concerns new titles for the descriptions of injuries.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burnett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to help the hon. Gentleman, discussion of amounts of money is out of order, we are concerned solely with the descriptions of injuries.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burnett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Fine.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have now given the hon. Gentleman clear direction.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burnett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should reiterate the point made by the hon. Member for Ryedale.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. gentleman may do that, so long as he does not reiterate those points that I have deemed out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burnett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We could do well further to consider the matter at length. Wide consultation on the draft document is needed. We caution the Government that, in the circumstances, the June deadline is short.<br><br>
I want to raise one or two miscellaneous points that are relevant to the draft document. The Committee is meant to debate that document and the scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Greenway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Jones. When hon. Members went to the Table Office to ask for the relevant documents for the Committee, they were given the White Paper and the draft document.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have given my ruling on that matter, and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will help the Committee to make progress.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burnett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Jones.<br><br>
I shall conclude by reminding the Minister that we should have liked the draft document and the scheme to have been debated in more detail, which would have allowed us to discuss, for example, allowances in net payments. The Minister should prevail on the Lord Chancellor—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I shall further help the hon. Gentleman. We are debating only the draft document, and I am sure that he will relate his arguments only to it. I know that he is a skilled
parliamentarian.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burnett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely grateful, Mr. Jones.<br><br>
We would like to have seen wider public consultation, and the House should have considered the proposals in more detail. We hope that the Government will make parliamentary time available to do so.</span></p>
<p>4.52 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond to the hon. Member for Ryedale in the same spirit in which he made his remarks. There are few compensations for being in opposition—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Greenway</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We know.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boateng</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Several Committee members have discovered mat over the years. One benefit, however, is that one can always say, "I told you so." The hon. Member for Ryedale can be forgiven for taking advantage of that opportunity to do so this afternoon—he was perfectly entitled to do so. My response is to say yes.<br><br>
The scheme that we inherited has the advantages of being clear and of giving a degree of certainty that was not present in the old scheme. It will also enable those who utilise it to do so without the use of lawyers. I say that in particular to the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon, although I believe that he has decided to give up his practice. No doubt he has good reasons for doing so.<br><br>
It is desirable to have a scheme that can be accessed with simplicity and certainty by the general public, in so far as mat is possible. The scheme should also be as comprehensive as possible. That will avoid the current fault lines, which caused some people not to receive what was their due under the scheme.<br><br>
The scheme was never meant to match what would have been available to a person through civil proceedings. It is a mistake to see the CICS as providing an alternative to seeking compensation through the usual civil channels. It was never designed to do that. The scheme clearly demonstrates society's acknowledgement that the victims of crime are entitled to some recognition of what they have been through. It is in that spirit that I urge the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon to approach the consultation exercise.<br><br>
Today's proceedings are discrete and self-

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
contained. Their sole aim is to enable the CICA to settle the 240 outstanding claims. I hope that hon. Members on both sides of the House who have representations to make on wider issues will take advantage of the consultation exercise. We will reflect on their contributions as they relate to the reforms that have been outlined. However, today's changes are essential if claimants are not to be
