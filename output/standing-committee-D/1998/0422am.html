INCAPACITY BENEFIT: REDUCTION FOR PENSION PAYMENTS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Amendment proposed [20 April]:</i> No. 141, in page 50, line 24, leave out the word 'payable' and insert the word 'paid'.—[<i>Mr. Oaten.</i>]</p>
<p>10 am</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 88, in page 50, leave out lines 36 to 39.<br><br>
Before I call the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies), a Committee member has unkindly suggested that I should declare an interest in our proceedings because I am using a walking stick. I remind the Committee that, regardless of where it thinks my brains may be, they are certainly not in my knee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies <span class='memberconstituency'>(Grantham and Stamford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It occurred to me to declare an interest when my back was giving me trouble a few weeks ago. I suspect that under the all-work test, I would have failed to qualify for benefit, but I passed the test to decide whether I was capable of work.<br><br>
When our previous sitting was adjourned, we were discussing amendments Nos. 141 and 88. The former is a Liberal Democrat amendment and the latter, narrower amendment was tabled by Conservative Members.<br><br>
I have made it clear that, in the clause, the Government are taking powers to claw back incapacity benefit if someone is in receipt of pension or insurance income. That is a double attack on the living standards of the disabled. If people are forced to take their pension early, the value will be savagely reduced and they will lose their incapacity benefit. Amendment No. 88 would remove new section 30DD(2)(c) and would deny the Government the power that they seek to impose on people who decline to bring forward the time at which they take their pension—which would reduce its value—a notional income, and to means-test their incapacity benefit against that notional income.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have no wish to interrupt the hon. Gentleman. As the Room is warm, it is in order for hon. Members to remove their jackets, but it is polite to ask first.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 902</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had a terrible feeling, but could not quite believe, Mr. McWilliam, that you were about to tell me that I was wide of the subject. This is perhaps the worst clause in this dreadful Bill and it is vital that we should have the opportunity of a stand part debate, so I am being particularly self-disciplined on this matter. I shall ask some precise, technical questions of great practical importance to all disabled people, who are being targeted by this pernicious clause and the concept of notional income, which our amendment would remove.<br><br>
The Government have thought through their unpleasant proposals attacking the living standards of disabled people. But we must ensure—I say that with scepticism based on the Government's performance on the Bill so far—that they have also thought through the restrictions on incapacity benefit. From the Bill, the explanatory memorandum or the glossy document entitled "A new contract for welfare" it is not clear whether the Government have thought that through. They certainly have not revealed their answers to the public or Parliament.<br><br>
My first question relates to notional income. How will it be calculated? Will actuarial science be applied to work out what annuity—what pension income—someone could achieve if he or she exercised the right to take an early pension? Is notional income to be calculated by referring to the annuity that that person could obtain? Let us be clear: will the calculation be based on annuity, actuarial methods or something else?<br><br>
If the calculation is based on annuity rates, will notional income be annual income, broken down into weekly amounts of annuity, as outlined in the clause, or will it be penal? That is my second question. The Government could calculate what a disabled person might be able to obtain by way of advance pension payments or annuity payments and add a penal element for not claiming it. Will there be a punitive measure? It is difficult to get answers out of the Government, so I am speaking slowly and distinctly. I am repeating my questions so that they have no excuse not to respond.<br><br>
I asked about penal rates. It occurs to me that, if this appalling Bill comes into force, it might be sensible for disabled people, who are being viciously targeted by the Government, not to take the pension to which they are entitled but to wait until normal retirement age or family circumstances are right and future plans are in place. The reduction or elimination, complete with withdrawals, of their entitlement to incapacity benefit could be accepted on the grounds that they would be receiving only one blow—a single whammy—rather than the double blow that the Government have planned for the disabled.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Hugh Bayley)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for putting a clear question, but I need some clarification. Is he arguing in principle against the use of a notional income rule or against the use of a notional income rule in this circumstance? The Conservatives introduced a notional income rule to take occupational pensions into account when calculating the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0966">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 903</span>
jobseeker's allowance, and that reduces the allowance in circumstances harsher than those that we are considering. Is he suggesting that the notional income rule that is used for the jobseeker's allowance is wrong and should be changed, or would he be satisfied if the same rule was used for incapacity benefit?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am going to answer that question. The Under-Secretary will appreciate that in the context of the dialogue between Government and Opposition that must take place in the House and in Committee, it would create the wrong impression if I evaded such a question. But I do not want to be drawn into the Government's trap by answering a question that is not directly germane to my amendment, only to be told that I weakened our case for the all-important clause stand part debate.<br><br>
All Conservative Members are opposed to the application of the notional income concept in this circumstance. We are, frankly, appalled. It is hideous that the Government do not appear to be able to distinguish between someone who is unemployed and someone who is disabled. Unemployment is, hopefully, transient and can be remedied 100 per cent., but a disability is often permanent and most people will not be able to return to their previous job or achieve the same stream of income. The Government seem incapable of understanding that there is all the difference in the world between the two situations.<br><br>
The disabled are a vulnerable group, and we should not argue, by analogy, that whatever is justified in relation to the unemployed is ipso facto justified in relation to the disabled. That logic has been used too often in this context by the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The notional income rule and the offset in relation to occupational pensions, which applies to the jobseeker's allowance, will be applied only during the year or two before a person's normal retirement date. As we know, such people find it difficult to get back into the labour market. Notional income is used not in relation to short-term cases but in relation to people who retire early because of sickness on an enhanced pension.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the Under-Secretary understands his own rules. He tried to draw an analogy between the contributory jobseeker's allowance and the situation in which notional income is relevant. In relation to the jobseeker's allowance, the issue does not arise after the six-month period, when that allowance is no longer a contributory jobseeker's allowance. We all agree that it is right for payments to be means-tested in that context. The issue arises only during the first six months, and it is therefore by definition a short-term problem for those who are unemployed.<br><br>
In relation to incapacity benefit, the issue is not a short-term problem. A person's IB will be means tested, savagely reduced and eliminated if a person's income is more than £179 a week, which I hope we all agree is not a great income. The problem will apply indefinitely—for as long as a person continues to receive IB.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 904</span>
No comparison can be made between the contributory jobseeker's allowance and IB. The financial blow that the Government plan to deliver will be much more devastating if you receive IB, because means testing and the notional income rule—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I know that it may be tiresome to point this out, but I am not in receipt of IB.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gainsborough)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: How could anyone think that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Apart from the fact that you have a walking stick, Mr. McWilliam, that thought would not cross anyone's mind. No one is more vigorous or active than you, not least in your ability to interrupt me at critical moments and when I am in full flow.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I interrupt the hon. Gentleman not because I want to but because he transgresses.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Misusing the pronoun in the second person is a terrible habit of mine, Mr. McWilliam. It is a terrible sin, for which I shall no doubt have to perform some complicated penance in the afterlife.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend should use the word "thou" in future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. If reincarnation is a fact, the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford may be a Standing Committee Chairman in a future life.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must return to my argument. There is no comparison between the position of the disabled and that of the unemployed. Unemployment is a transient phenomenon about which people can do something, and we want to encourage them to do so. Invalidity and permanent disability are involuntary situations about which people can do very little. They can follow their doctor's advice and hope for an improvement but, with the best will in the world, they cannot do anything about their condition.<br><br>
To impose a financial sanction on such people in an attempt to force them to do something about their condition is cruel and inhuman. However, that is exactly what the Government are doing. They argue that the disciplines that apply in relation to the jobseeker's allowance should also be applied to the disabled. We reject that revolting proposal outright. I must inform the Under-Secretary that, frankly, the Government's proposal sticks in our gullet, and I hope that we shall hear no more about it.<br><br>
The two situations are not comparable even in purely financial terms. If the notional income rule is applied to someone who has lost the contributory jobseeker's allowance, a six-month period, at the most, will be involved. That is not the case in relation to IB—the exclusion may continue for years. The Government are levying a much greater financial burden on the disabled than the unemployed. In the case of the disabled, it is utterly unjustified.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 905</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security (Mr. Stephen Timms)</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister of State is trying to spare the embarrassment of his hon. Friend the Under-Secretary by rising to intervene. I shall of course allow him to do so, but I should say that the Government are digging themselves even deeper into a nasty hole.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I simply wanted the hon. Gentleman to acknowledge that, in this respect, the jobseeker's allowance regime is in fact harsher. Where the measure before us proposes that 50 per cent. of the notional income be taken into account, the jobseeker's allowance takes 100 per cent. into account.</span></p>
<p>10.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a complete sleight of hand. Once again, new Labour thinks that it can bamboozle the public, the Committee and the Opposition, but it cannot. Under the clause, where income exceeds £179 a week, the whole of a person's invalidity benefit will be extinguished. The Minister of State is looking through his papers for that calculation. It is in the relevant Library research paper, the page reference for which I shall provide in a moment.<br><br>
I put it to the Minister that £179 a week is not an enormous amount of money. Under the clause, wealthy people, whose assets will mostly be business assets, stocks and shares, and so on, will not suffer at all. However, people with modest incomes from insurance policies or pension funds will have their benefit fully extinguished. Through what is a modest threshold, the 50 per cent. rule will lead to the 100 per cent. removal of incapacity benefit.<br><br>
One of the advantages of being in government is that one has wonderful, invisible people who provide information during proceedings such as ours. I do not enjoy that advantage, but I am grateful to helpful colleagues such as my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh), who has just provided the page reference for the calculation to which I referred a moment ago. Page 73 of Library research paper 99/19 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"So, for example, where a person is on the basic long-term rate of Incapacity Benefit of £64.70 per week with no other additions, their Incapacity Benefit would be extinguished if their occupational or personal pension exceeded £179.40 per week."</p></blockquote>
Thanks to the efforts of my hon. Friend, I am able to provide a more precise figure by adding 40p to the £179 to which I had referred.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mark Oaten <span class='memberconstituency'>(Winchester)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that I am right in saying that, based on those figures, the annual income will be about £10,000, which is below the poverty line. Therefore, the people who will lose out through the removal of incapacity benefit are those who are below the poverty line.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to have my point reinforced.<br><br>
I hope that you will testify, Mr. McWilliam, to my sincere efforts to focus strictly and narrowly on the amendment, and to the severity of my self-discipline in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 906</span>
that respect, excepting those occasions when points are made to which, in the interests of a fair debate, I must respond. I must ensure that the Opposition's case is not lost by default.<br><br>
I shall now return to my questions on the amendment. I hope that the Minister who is to reply took note of the two that I have already asked. If he fails to answer them in his winding-up speech, I shall ask them again. I asked whether the calculation will add a penal element to the notional annuity, and I intended to make a point that is highly relevant to the amendment and the concept of notional income. If I were a disabled person who faced the prospect of compulsory early collection of my pension, which would reduce substantially its long-term value, and the loss of my invalidity benefit, which would be means-tested against the pension, I would decide not to face that double attack by the Government on my standard of living, but instead to take a single whammy hit. I would not claim my pension, which would preserve its value, but instead face the Government's imposition of a notional income based on the amount of the pension had I taken it early. I would accept the loss to income and even the complete loss of incapacity benefit, because that would be extinguished if my income exceeded £179 a week, but at least my pension would not be reduced in value. On reaching normal retirement age, I would get the pension income that I would otherwise have received. It would be logical to do that. Either the Government are too stupid to have thought that through or they are planning a penal rate.<br><br>
My third question also relates to the calculation of notional income. As it is possible for me to use the first person singular in a non-specific sense, even if I am not allowed to use the second person singular, let us suppose that I am the disabled person. If I decide not to take my pension early, which the Government are trying to force me to do, and have a notional income imposed on me, will that notional income be calculated on the basis of a single annuity on my life or an annuity on two lives, that of myself and my spouse? If the notional income calculation is annuity based, will it be linked to a single or joint annuity?<br><br>
Fourthly, will the annuity be fixed-rate indexed? Will the Government assume that the annuity is indexed to prices, earnings or the stock market, because it is now possible to get annuities that are based on an indexed contract on the futures or derivatives market? Alternatively, will they assume that the annuity is a straight annuity that provides constant nominal payments calculated on my actuarial life and paid to me on the basis of my actual life.<br><br>
My fifth question relates to the personal pension lump sum. For the purposes of calculating the notional annuity, will the Government assume that I am taking 25 per cent., as I am allowed to do under tax rules, out of my personal pension when I claim it? As you know, Mr. McWilliam, 25 per cent. of the value of the pension and the market value of the assets held in the pension fund can be taken as a lump sum at the beginning of retirement. If I am going to be forced either to take early retirement and draw down my pension early, thereby reducing its value, or to have a corresponding notional income imposed on me, will it be assumed that I have taken the 25 per cent. lump
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0968">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 907</span>
sum? That would make an enormous difference to the calculation. The amount that would be available to purchase the annuity would be different by a factor of 33.3 per cent., depending on whether the 25 per cent. capital sum had been removed from the initial pension fund.<br><br>
The rules are slightly different for an occupational pension scheme. What can be taken as a lump sum depends on the terms of the scheme. A final salary scheme is usually based not on the value of a fund, because there is no individual fund, but on an earnings factor—so many times final salary. That could be once or twice final annual salary, or six months' worth, depending on the pension rules.<br><br>
My sixth question relates to the occupational pension lump sum. What assumptions will be made about that? Will notional income be tailored for each individual on whom it is going to be imposed according to the terms of the occupational pension scheme? That is a fantastically complex and wasteful bureaucratic exercise. One can imagine bureaucrats sitting in offices and writing endless letters to trustees of a pension fund to ask for the rules of the fund and how they might be interpreted in the case of a particular person. Will a notional lump sum payment be taken into account or not? Alternatively, will there be a standardised notional lump sum amount taken out of everybody's calculation, irrespective of any individual's entitlement, under any given occupational scheme, to a salary-related lump sum on retirement. Those are fundamental questions relating to notional income, and they require clear answers.<br><br>
At what age will the notional income rule be applied? Will it be applied at any age at which a person becomes disabled, or will it be applied from age 60? If it is applied from age 60, will that not involve a degree of discrimination between men and women? Women can take their state retirement pension from the age of—I think—61 or 62. Men cannot do so until they are 65. The incomes of people whose circumstances were otherwise the same would, as a result of the implementation of the notional income rule, differ according to their sex. A disabled woman will have a higher income than a man whose medical and financial circumstances are otherwise identical, as she will have a state retirement pension. According to the explanatory memorandum, the Government do not propose to offset incapacity benefit entitlement against state retirement pension. Will the age at which the notional income rule is applied therefore be the same for men and women? Otherwise, will not sex discrimination be an issue? I suppose I have asked questions seven, eight and nine.<br><br>
Will the notional income rule be applied to those with state earnings related pension schemes? I am told that the Government plan not to do so, which is an appalling discrimination against people who have contracted out of SERPS into a personal pension. For those who stayed in SERPS, the income under that scheme will be protected. If a person becomes disabled, any money received under the SERPS pension will not be set off against any entitlement to incapacity benefit. The contract between the state and the individual was that there would be no
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 908</span>
subsequent discrimination, but people who have opted out will be forced to take the pension early, which will reduce its value, or will find that their personal pension is subject to a notional income charge. That is clear discrimination between those who contracted in and those who contracted out, which is unprecendented in this area of the pensions market.<br><br>
Alternatively, will the Government calculate what portion of someone's personal pension is a result of contracting-out rebates? It could therefore be ring fenced and relieved from the calculation of notional income. The notional income charge would only be calculated on the basis of the portion of the value of someone's accumulated personal pension that has resulted from his or her employer's contributions and not from contributions under the Contributions Agency's rebate system.<br><br>
That was my 10th question. All of my questions require clear answers if we are able to have a meaningful debate on the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to answer all of the questions to the satisfaction of hon. Members. I shall start with those raised by the hon. Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten) when he moved his amendment on Tuesday. He said that he was probing the Government's intention and asked what would happen to the pension entitlement of someone who deferred his pension until the age of 65 and had the notional income rule applied, but died before the age of 65. The answer is the same as in any circumstances in which someone dies before a pension becomes payable. A choice must be made. Those of us who are fortunate enough to have some flexibility on retirement date and pension must make a choice. If a pension is payable at either 60 or 65 and the later date is chosen but the beneficiary dies before that, the pension is not paid, although there may be some underlying rights to widow's pension and so on.</span></p>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oaten</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that, but I asked the Minister to acknowledge that it would be unfair in those circumstances if someone had the notional incomes taken from his incapacity benefit but never benefited from the pension because he died before the age of 65. That is the aspect that I want the Minister to deal with.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying, but the decision to defer payment of a pension is made by the beneficiary. If he is entitled to receive the pension at the age of 60 and chooses to defer it to a later date, he will receive a higher pension. That decision faces anyone who has a choice of date on which to start receiving a pension. The point of the notional income rule—it has existed in social security legislation for a long time—is to deal with a situation in which someone chooses to put off receiving a pension simply to maximise the amount of money that he or she receives from the social security system. There would be no question of someone being forced to call in a pension earlier and, therefore, at a lower rate, if they had a legitimate expectation of receiving income from the pension at the age of 65 and that was the basis on which they planned

their finances. We have no intention of doing that under the existing notional income rules, which were introduced by a Conservative Government, or under the changes that we are introducing to the rules in relation to incapacity benefit. I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel) referred to someone who defers a pension with a variable date for commencement of payment—for example, sometime between the ages of 60 and 65. If, at the age of 60, someone decides to exercise his legitimate choice to receive the pension at 65 and subsequently becomes incapacitated at 62, the notional income rule will not apply because no pension income will become available.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) made some interesting points, but, as he is not in the Room, I shall pass over them because they were reflected in points raised by his hon. Friends.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that it is impossible for the Government to distinguish between those people who deliberately defer payment of their pension to maximise incapacity benefit and those who would have deferred it anyway, perhaps because annuity rates are low?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I refer the hon. Gentleman to the existing notional income rules, which distinguish between personal pensions and occupational pensions. It is easier to deal with occupational pensions because most of them have a defined date on which the benefit will be paid. Normally, the date is fixed but there may be flexibility in some cases. The notional income rule would apply only when there was flexibility and when it appeared to the Department of Social Security that someone had decided to create an entitlement to social security payments that he would not otherwise have had.<br><br>
The rule for personal pensions is much simpler. They involve a fund of money that is used to buy an annuity that will provide an income stream on retirement. An occupational pension involves a more elaborate contract between the member of a pension scheme and the pension trustees. Payments are made according to certain rules and against a guarantee that the member will receive a certain income stream, which is normally related to final salary, on retirement.<br><br>
Personal pensions involve a real kitty of money, and the individual decides when to turn it into an annuity. The hon. Members for Arundel and South Downs and for Grantham and Stamford discussed the general principle that the later a pension is turned into an annuity, the higher the weekly rate. We also need to consider when it is best to buy an annuity.<br><br>
Personal pensions involve both real money and flexibility. The notional income rules that the Conservative Government operated for many years—they introduced them in relation to personal pensions—set a specified date at which the social security system would regard it as appropriate to take pension income into account, namely, at the age of 60. Unlike a policeman, for example, whose pension could, in certain circumstances, be paid before he reached 60, someone with a personal pension has an absolute guarantee that his pension will
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 910</span>
not be taken into account before he reaches that age. The rules state that the pension will be taken into account at that age. That does not require the person to cash in his kitty of money to buy an annuity at that point. He may decide, perhaps after receiving financial advice, that it would be better to defer. The relevant legislation makes it clear that that is the point at which a personal pension kicks in, and the same rules apply to incapacity benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Rendel <span class='memberconstituency'>(Newbury)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: In relation to the case that I raised on Tuesday, the Under-Secretary stated that if someone does not take his pension and becomes incapacitated, the pension will not be payable and will not count under the rules. I imagine that there are schemes under which it is open to the member of a scheme to take the pension at any time between the ages of 60 and 65. Would it count in this context?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government are keen to preserve all the legitimate choices that the public currently have. No one would seek to prevent a person who can legitimately take his pension at a certain time from doing so. Most schemes set a particular date for retirement. If the scheme has infinite flexibility—personal pensions do—the notional income rules will be relevant.<br><br>
We shall not require people who have a legitimate choice and who have saved in a pension scheme, on the expectation that they would draw a pension at a certain age, to forego those benefits. No exceptional steps are required to take the pension into account at an earlier date.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford asked how the notional income will be calculated. The simple answer is that it will be calculated according to the rules that currently apply to those benefits that require notional income to be calculated. He also asked whether a deduction would be based on an actuarial calculation or set a penal level. I can reassure the Committee that the rules will take account of income that would have been available to claimants if they had put their pension into payment. In making that calculation, my Department will seek the best available evidence from the claimant and, if necessary, from other sources. Where a claimant believes that an unreasonable calculation has been made, he or she will have the right of appeal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary used the ambiguous phrase, "take account of." One could take account of the actuarial calculation but add a penal rate to it. Is he saying that no such penal addition will be made to the actuarial calculation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not being difficult, but I would like the hon. Gentleman to elaborate on his comments. The Government intend to take account of income that would be available if the pension were put into payment at that point. People have the right not to put their pension into payment. Where a person takes such a decision, which may be taken for entirely legitimate reasons, we shall not attempt to load on an additional penalty. However, I may have missed the hon. Gentleman's point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Under-Secretary is assuring me that the Government will make the actuarial calculation on the basis of the amount of money that a person would have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0970">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 911</span>
received if he had taken the pension, that is a clearer and better answer than the alternative. Of course, the consequences of that answer are the ones that I set out when I posed the question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am given to understand that, in broad terms, that is the Government's intention. Clearly, I cannot comment on a particular calculation. People use many different financial instruments to provide for their retirement. Certainly, we do not intend to load on an additional percentage for the extraneous purpose of nuisance value.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford said that the Government's proposal to apply an offset against pensions in incapacity benefit was not comparable to the situation pertaining to jobseeker's allowance. If I understand him correctly, he said that the application to JSA is confined to the first six months of unemployment, when contributory jobseeker's allowance is paid. That is not correct. After six months, 100 per cent. of a pension, not 50 per cent. is taken into account. There is no disregard of £50.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the Under-Secretary is trying to confuse the Committee, or whether he is himself confused. After six months, all unemployment benefits are in any case means tested. All income is taken into account when calculating entitlement. The only relevant comparison that he could possibly make would be between the contributory incapacity benefit and the contributory jobseeker's allowance, which, by definition, is paid only during the first six months. That is the only period in which people have a national insurance entitlement to a benefit that, in normal circumstances, ought not to be means tested. The Under-Secretary is trying to introduce into incapacity benefit the version of partial means testing against pensions that exists for jobseeker's allowance. The analogy is inappropriate and cruel, but it is his analogy. He is comparing contributory jobseeker's allowance, which is available for six months, with incapacity benefit. National insurance benefit, which is a contributory benefit, is paid for the period of incapacity, which may be for life.</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not trying to mislead the Committee, and I am sure that that is not the hon. Gentleman's intention, let me make it clear what proportion of a pension would be taken into account in respect of each claim. Under the existing rules for jobseeker's allowance, a person who becomes unemployed but who is not incapacitated from work would have a disregard of £50 for a pension that he was receiving and would lose 100 per cent. of all pension payments in excess of £50 during the first six months of the claim. Under the rules for non-contributory jobseeker's allowance, a claimant would not have a disregard of £50 after six months. As the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford said, his party changed the rules and made jobseeker's allowance a means-tested benefit after six months.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 912</span>
When someone becomes unemployed and there is no incapacity, there is a £50 disregard and 100 per cent. loss of income thereafter for the first six months. After six months, there is 100 per cent. loss of all pension income. Our change to incapacity benefit will allow a £50 disregard for as long as someone receives incapacity benefit. It will remove not 100 per cent. of the income in addition to that £50, which will be removed from the incapacity benefit, but 50 per cent. The notional income rule would apply to both the first six months and the subsequent period of jobseeker's allowance. We propose that it should also apply to incapacity benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that we are in danger of wasting our time. We all understand that the Government are trying to extend the notional income regime that applies to contributory jobseeker's allowance to incapacity benefit. We believe that the analogy between the two benefits is inappropriate and vicious. Both are national insurance contributory benefits. What happens after someone has received jobseeker's allowance for six months is neither here nor there. That is a means-tested benefit, not a national insurance benefit. It is irrelevant.<br><br>
There is a major difference between a disabled person and an unemployed person. It is astonishingly insensitive of the Government not to understand that. I stand by my point that a beneficiary of incapacity benefit may suffer a financial loss, possibly involving a substantial multiple. People may be on incapacity benefit for the rest of their working lives until retirement. The amount of benefit that is clawed back from contributory jobseeker's allowance must be limited to six months. People can lose only a few hundred pounds. Means testing of incapacity benefit will result in people losing tens of thousands of pounds over the rest of their working lives.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Interventions should be brief. That was a bit long.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford is sadly mistaken if he believes that a person who loses his job close to retirement will easily get back to work. I hope that the Government's measures to extend new deal initiatives to older people will make it easier for someone in those circumstances to find work, but we do not have a magic wand.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The opportunity lost to the individual is within the six-month period. It cannot be longer than that because, after six months, the jobseeker's allowance is 100 per cent. means-tested, as the Under-Secretary knows. An income of £179 a week is a lot of money—about £8,000, according to previous calculations. Losing £8,000 a year for several years is equivalent to losing several tens of thousands of pounds. It would not be possible to lose such an amount as a result of the application of the notional income rule and partial means-testing to a maximum of six months of contributory jobseeker's allowance. It is extraordinary that the Under-Secretary has not grasped that—I cannot believe that he is so obtuse. I am also afraid that he may be trying to bamboozle the Committee rather than dealing with my questions precisely.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 913</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have already ruled on the length of interventions. The Committee should also recognise that the amendments under discussion are narrow—they do not relate to jobseeker's allowance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford told the Committee that what happens after six months is irrelevant. People who are out of work and facing living on a pension or benefit—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an irrelevant comparison.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is relevant. How the notional income rule applies is extremely relevant. The rules that were introduced for people who are nearing retirement and out of work but not incapacitated are a great deal harsher than those under discussion today.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been a technical debate. I want to establish the ground rules in simple terms, so that people can understand what it is about. Am I right in saying that as soon as an individual's combined income from incapacity benefit and a personal pension reaches £6,071 a year, he starts to lose incapacity benefit? Furthermore, when that income reaches £9,537 per annum—equivalent to half of the national average male earnings of £21,252, and a very small income—you will lose incapacity benefit entirely. Are those the facts?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. First, I am not losing anything—I know that it is tiresome. Secondly, I have already warned the Committee that the amendments are narrow and the debate is now going much too wide.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Gainsborough is—I believe—referring to the House of Commons Library calculations, according to which people who are entitled to the long-term rate of incapacity benefit would lose all entitlement to IB when their weekly income reached £179. That is almost correct. It was correct when the document was produced by the Library, but the April upratings mean that the figure is now slightly higher at £183.50.<br><br>
However, it would be wrong, to say that that will apply to all people in all circumstances. Rates of incapacity benefit vary for a number of reasons, such as age and dependency additions. For some people in the early stages of their claim—without additions—entitlement to IB could be fully extinguished at a lower figure. There will not be many such people, but there will be some. For somebody who receives the maximum additions, the figure is merely £16,000. The figure mentioned by the hon. Member for Gainsborough has increased slightly as a result of the April upratings, but that figure does not apply to every person in every circumstance.<br><br>
I shall respond to the six technical questions that were asked by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford about pensions calculations. He asked when the notional income rule would be applied. Will the pension that will be available be calculated in terms of a single person or a couple? The answer is that it will depend on the person's circumstances and on whether he is a single person or part of a couple. The notional income rules will use the best possible calculation of the pension that will actually be available if the person sought payment of it.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 914</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is appalling. A wife, for example, might be considerably younger than her husband and have her own earnings. To include her in the joint annuity calculation would vastly reduce the value of the annuity because of the different life expectancies that are involved. On the other hand, that would not be a sensible use of the family's resources because she was younger and had her own earning and pension prospects. A married person might therefore have good reasons for preferring to take a single annuity. The notional income test would artificially impose a different choice on the couple. The Under-Secretary has given an appalling answer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In my reply I was thinking about an occupational pension, which often includes a spouse's pension. I have already said that the Government do not intend to constrain in any way the legitimate choices that people can make about their pension.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford made an interesting point. I would not want to impose requirements on someone who had legitimately planned to convert an annuity for his or her, but not for his or her spouse's, benefit. I shall examine the matter and write to him about it.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked whether the annuity would take account of inflation or whether it would be a fixed-rate annuity. Again, the answer depends on what the individual has bought into and on the nature of the pension scheme. If a personal pension was used to buy an annuity, any legitimate choice that a person made would be acceptable.<br><br>
The notional income rule will be applied in cases in which someone defers a pension that otherwise would have been paid on the grounds that taking the pension would extinguish his right to a social security benefit. The rule will not require people to make choices that they would not normally be expected to make.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I fear that the Under-Secretary is answering a question that I did not ask, and he is therefore likely to be in trouble with you, Mr. McWilliam, and with me.<br><br>
I accept that making a legitimate choice will discharge the obligation that the clause will impose on an individual to take a personal or occupational pension when one is available, but that does not answer my question. I asked what would happen if a person declined that choice and did not take the pension when he otherwise might have done. How will the notional income that is used to means test that persons's IB be calculated? Will the notional income be premised on the assumption of a joint or single annuity, on an indexed annuity or on whether or not a 25 per cent. lump sum had been taken? We need to know how the notional income will be calculated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman referred to the clear, legitimate choices that a person has about converting his savings in a personal pension fund into an income stream. The notional income rule will take account of the income that will be available if someone takes his pension at the normal age. For a personal
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0972">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 915</span>
pension, that is deemed in statute to be 60, and for an occupational pension, it will depend on the date on which the pension matures under the pension scheme rules.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford asked about the position in relation to a lump sum. Again, it will depend on the rules of the scheme. The hon. Gentleman casts his eyes to the ceiling, but it does depend on the rules of the scheme. If the scheme allows for a lump sum, no one is going to say that the person must forgo it. He will have saved on that basis and he should be able to take his pension on that basis. I have already referred to the ages involved—it will be 60 for a personal pension and the normal age of payment for other pension schemes.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman seemed to be angry that the notional income rule would not be applied to SERPS. The reason for that is simple: SERPS comes into payment at the normal pension age. There is no doubt about when it comes into payment and no opportunity to play about with the date, so the position is clear.<br><br>
The amendments would remove the power in the Bill to assume a notional income when a claimant deliberately fails to avail himself of a pension payment with the intention of increasing or maximising his benefit.<br><br>
The power to assume a notional income is a long-standing feature that runs right across the social security system. It is there to prevent abuse of the benefit system where people deliberately deprive themselves of income in order to qualify for benefits or increase the amount of their benefit.<br><br>
I recognise that concern has been expressed that this measure could force people to take their pensions early. That is not our intention. We do not want to interfere with the choices that people are entitled to make about when to take their pension and how much to take in the form of a lump sum, but we need to have the power to deal with situations if someone acts unreasonably to maximise his benefit income.<br><br>
The details will all be in regulations and we shall be able to look at specific concerns when we are framing those. We intend to base the incapacity benefit rules on those that currently apply to the income-related benefits and contribution-based jobseeker's allowance, which were introduced by the Opposition when they were in government.<br><br>
Under those regulations, people under the age of 60 with a personal pension are exempted from the effects of the notional income rules. This recognises that flexibility is an essential feature of these pension schemes. A claimant who is over 60 would be expected to take up his pension if he had not already done so. This does not seem unreasonable in striking a balance between individual choice and the need to prevent abuse of the benefits system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rendel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I return to the intervention that I made just before the end of Tuesday's sitting? Does the Government's proposal imply that people over 60 will not go back into work? I thought that the point of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 916</span>
Government's thesis was that even those who had some incapacity should be given every opportunity to go back into work. The Government now say that when someone is over 60, he is not expected to get back into work.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not what the Government are saying. The hon. Gentleman makes a pertinent point, as there are some variations to the benefits system that reflect and acknowledge the fact that for men over 60, the opportunity of getting back into a job is far less than for younger men, but it is certainly not the Government's intention to write people off to a life on benefits at the age of 60. The hon. Gentleman may have misunderstood the reason why the Government have introduced a point at 60 at which the notional income rule will come into operation for personal pensions only. In some ways, there is a measure of protection that is not available to people on occupational pensions, because there is a guarantee that the notional income rule will not apply to people with personal pensions before the age of 60.<br><br>
A date has been set in relation to personal pensions because, rather than contracts, they are savings funds in which a series of pension contributions are converted at a specific age into pensions paid according to fixed rules. Therefore, the Government have to stipulate an age at which they come into operation, which is why the age of 60 is specified in the existing notional income rules on personal pensions. We need to specify an age.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rendel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In practice, does that not mean that those who have such a personal pension will, when they get to 60, be more or less forced to take it otherwise it will be included against their incapacity benefit anyway? Once they have taken it, there will be a discouragement to go back to work, as they will earn less—if they have a pension as well, they will be taxed at a higher rate, and so on. The Government are giving them a disincentive to go back to work by forcing them to take the pension that they have paid.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All individuals must make choices in relation to their own circumstances. If people believe that they will be out of work, with no alternative, from the age of 60 to 65, many will exercise the option to put their personal pension into payment from the age of 60, albeit in the knowledge that it will yield less per week than if they had put it into payment at the age of 65. Others will believe that their period of unemployment will be fairly brief and will decide not to put their pension into payment. That choice will depend on individual circumstances.<br><br>
In the case of occupational pensions, the notional income rules can in theory apply at any age. However, in such circumstances it is usually the trustees or administrators of a scheme who decide whether an occupational pension will be paid early. That has to be done in accordance with the rules of the scheme and the Inland Revenue guidelines. In practice, the amount of choice that the individual has is limited, so the provision is unlikely to affect people.<br><br>
Of course, we are in favour of allowing people to take their pensions more easily. Proposals for new flexibilities on when occupational pensions can be taken have been
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0973">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 917</span>
the subject of consultation by the Inland Revenue and were set out in the pensions Green Paper. When the flexibilities are introduced, we will need to consider again the rules for benefits that currently take account of notional income and the future rules for incapacity benefit.<br><br>
The notional income rules are of long standing and, to the best of our knowledge, have not caused any significant problems in practice, either with occupational pensions, where as I explained their impact is limited, or with personal pensions, where they apply from age 60 only.<br><br>
I assure the Committee that when the incapacity benefit regulations are introduced, we will give full consideration to any concerns about how the rules may affect people in certain circumstances. For the present, we are discussing the need for a power to make regulations to prevent abuse of the social security system. The amendment would remove our ability to prevent such abuse and I urge the Committee to reject it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid to say that the Minister's performance has been thoroughly unsatisfactory this morning. It is clear that the Government are shambolic and incompetent and that he did not even know the answers to the questions that I asked him.<br><br>
The Minister ended by making another complete howler by pretending that the position for occupational pension scheme members is analogous in the cases of unemployment and disability. Occupational pension schemes make no provision for people simply to take their pension early on the grounds of unemployment. There is always a minimum age at which they can be taken. Many occupational pension schemes include provision under Inland Revenue rules for people to take an immediate pension at any age if they become disabled, but not if they simply become unemployed. So the position of someone who claims contributory jobseeker's allowance is not analogous to that of someone who claims contributory incapacity benefit.<br><br>
The second point on which the Under-Secretary went wrong is that, although it is true that trustees have limited powers to give people early pensions if they become disabled, they are limited by Inland Revenue rules and the rules of the schemes and under no circumstances will trustees give someone an early pension unless an application is made to them. The potential beneficiaries must apply and say, "I am now disabled. Here are my medical reports. Please pay me an early pension." That can be done at any age. The rules of such a scheme must correspond to the Inland Revenue's rules, otherwise it would not have approved the scheme.<br><br>
It is wrong of the Under-Secretary to say that trustees have limited powers and, therefore, the problem does not arise. Of course, the problem arises. The individual has a choice: he either makes an application to the trustees for the early payment of pension on the grounds of disability, or he does not. In a sense, he has exactly the same choice in occupational pension and personal pension contexts. It is extraordinary that the Under-Secretary should portray his ignorance of such matters, but I am afraid that he has done so.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 918</span>
All the questions that I have asked have been on notional income. The amendment deals with whether the Government should be given the power to impose a notional income rule. Clearly, we could not possibly responsibly give the Government that power because they do not know how it would be applied. The Committee knows no more about that than it did an hour ago. It does not know whether or not the 25 per cent. lump sum will be taken into account in the calculation of the notional income. It does not know whether the annuity rate will be applied to the calculation. It is not known whether the annuity calculation will involve the imposition of a notional income, nor whether it will be an indexed annuity. The Under-Secretary has not told us—perhaps he will now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making a mountain out of a molehill. Is he aware of a single case in which the notional income rules applied to JSA have created any of the problems that he alleges might happen? I assure him that we simply intend to apply parallel notional income rules to those that already exist.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary is now confessing his complete ignorance. If he knew the answers to my precise questions, he would tell us. Perhaps the Department of Social Security has foreseen such matters and made some plans accordingly, but he has not had the nous to ask questions about them—or the Department has not told him—or perhaps the whole bureaucracy has not yet focused on these important matters and no answer is available in the whole Department.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary has received a message, so perhaps he can now answer my questions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have answered the hon. Gentleman's questions fully and frankly. I return to the question that I asked him to answer fully and frankly. Notional income rules are already laid down in regulations. We shall introduce parallel regulations under the clause. Is the hon. Gentleman aware of any case in which the difficulties that he mentioned have occurred under the existing rules? If he is, he should tell us and we could consider introducing different rules. If he is not, he should sit down so that we can move on to other matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have already said that an appropriate analogy cannot be drawn between contributory JSA and incapacity benefit. I will not go back over that. If I were to do so, I would be accused of repetition and we could lose the chance to hold a clause stand part debate. That debate is becoming more important every second, as we see the confusion that the Government are in. I shall refer to notional incomes—the subject of the amendment. Ministers cannot possibly tell the Committee that they want to impose notional, income-based means tests without defining how that notional income will be calculated. We have heard no definition and no precise answers to the precise and pertinent questions that I have asked the Minister, who has once again been trying to

throw sand in our eyes. He has said constantly this morning that the Government will accept any reasonable decision that someone makes about the basis on which that person takes his pension. That is not the point. Of course we need to know in what circumstances the notional income rule will be applied and it is reassuring to know that someone who makes what the Minister calls a "reasonable choice" about the formula under which he draws down his pension will have his incapacity benefit set off against that pension income and that no attempt will be made to say that he should have made an alternative choice in terms of, for example, indexation or of joint or single annuities. We have established that, but that does not begin to answer my question about how notional income will be calculated if someone declines to draw down their pension in advance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must finish my point before I give way, but of course I shall do so; I always have and always will in these Committee sittings, subject to your approval, Mr. McWilliam.<br><br>
We must be clear about that point. Before Parliament gives the Government the power to make a notional income calculation, we need to know the formula on which it will be based. The notional income stream will differ depending on whether the pension is indexed and whether 25 per cent. is abstracted before the calculation. All the points that I have made this morning are just as relevant as they were when I made them the first time round, but they are now of searing political significance, because the Government are trying to take a power from the House and do not know—or at least will not tell Parliament—how they propose to exercise it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The debate is becoming seriously repetitive. Unless the Committee sorts itself out shortly, I shall have to ask the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford to resume his seat.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, Mr. McWilliam—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall stay strictly within the terms of the amendment, which relates to the rules on notional income. I have asked the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford a question twice. I do so a third time and hope that he will reply. I have done him the courtesy of replying to his questions; he may not like the answers, but I have done so. We intend to apply to incapacity benefit rules on notional income that are analogous to the rules that already exist in the social security system that the Conservative party introduced. They will be the same rules. Is he aware of any problems that those rules have created? If so, he should tell the Committee so that the Government can consider them when drafting the regulations. If not, perhaps we should move on to the wider issues that the clause raises.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mr. McWilliam, you have put me in an extremely difficult position, because I must do nothing to risk our opportunity for a clause stand part debate. I must
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 920</span>
observe to the letter your strictures and must not repeat myself. I am afraid that I have already dealt with the Minister's question about the extent to which an analogy exists between contributory jobseeker's allowance and contributory incapacity benefit.<br><br>
I believe that you will consider this a fair point to make, Mr. McWilliam, in the context of the amendment, without the slightest repetition. Every time that a Government ask the House for a notional income power—which is a penal power to impose on the citizen—that power must be justified in the case in which it will be applied and Parliament is entitled to know the details of its application. The Government have not told us the details.<br><br>
The Minister is thrashing around, desperately trying to find a way of hiding the fact that he does not know the answers to my questions. We have not received an answer about the 25 per cent. lump sum or indexation. We are now witnessing the extraordinary affront of a Minister of the Crown asking the Opposition to tell the Committee how a power that the Government propose to take should work. That is inconceivable. It shows that we have a thoroughly incompetent Government. It is important that we have the opportunity to vote on the amendment. It would be irresponsible for Parliament to confer this power on a Government who are in such confusion about the meaning of it.<br><br>
If I am not following the correct formal procedure to secure my obvious purpose, I hope that you, Mr. McWilliam, or the Clerk will tell me. It is crucial because the Opposition set great store on being able to vote on amendment No. 88. I must draw that to the Committee's attention and formally do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oaten</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We moved this narrow amendment on Tuesday in order to establish the Government's intentions. The Minister has admitted his fear that, to avoid the impact of what is going to happen to incapacity benefit, some individuals will want to defer their pensions. The Government do not want that to happen and they are introducing these measures to prevent it. That is clear, but the Minister has not made clear exactly how the provision will work in detail.<br><br>
I am not convinced by the Minister's arguments. I remain confused about why he persists with the argument that because of what is happening to JSA, the principle is not being broken or changed. He was persistently questioned by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford on that point. The difference seems to be that JSA is a six-month benefit: what individuals do about deferral in relation to a six-month impact is clearly different.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman, too, misunderstands the point. The notional income rule is applied to anyone on long-term JSA, whether contributory or non-contributory. That has happened for some years and, as far as I am aware, it has caused none of the difficulties mentioned by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford. The point about application to a six-month period is a red herring. The notional income rule applies to the whole period in which JSA is paid—five years or longer.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 921</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oaten</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Individuals' perception of how their pension will be affected over a long time will make them change their pension habits in a way that has not necessarily happened with respect to JSA in the past. People's concern about the unfairness will make them rethink their pension plans. That is our worry about the impact of the clause. The Minister is wrong if he believes that individuals will not decide to defer; on the contrary, in these circumstances, some individuals will decide that they have to take their pension early. It narrows down options and people are likely to rethink their habits.<br><br>
We are not convinced by the Minister and we believe that the provision could lead to an administrative nightmare. We shall thus press the amendment to a Division.</span></p>
