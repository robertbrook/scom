Draft Civil Legal Aid (Financial Conditions) (Scotland) Regulations 1999</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Home Affairs and Devolution, Scottish Office (Mr. Henry McLeish)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Civil Legal Aid (Financial Conditions) (Scotland) Regulations 1999.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the draft Advice and Assistance (Financial Conditions) (Scotland) Regulations 1999.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be useful to the Committee if I explain the regulations in detail. The Advice and Assistance (Financial Conditions) (Scotland) Regulations 1999 will uprate the financial eligibility limits for advice and assistance. We propose that the lower weekly disposable income limit be raised from £72 to £75 and that the upper limit be raised from £172 to £178. As a consequence of those upratings, the regulations will revise the contribution bands that determine the level of contribution payable by those applicants who receive advice and assistance.<br><br>
The eligibility uprating represents a 3.2 per cent, increase on the 1997-98 limits. That matches increases proposed to income-related social security benefits and will ensure that people on low and modest incomes will continue to have access to advice and assistance when they need it.<br><br>
The Civil Legal Aid (Financial Conditions) (Scotland) Regulations 1999 will uprate the financial eligibility limits for civil legal aid. They will raise the lower disposable income limit, below which civil legal aid is available without contribution by the assisted person, from £2,625 to £2,680 a year. They will raise the upper limit, above which civil legal aid is not available, from £8,571 to £8,751 a year.<br><br>
The changes represent a 2.1 per cent, increase on the 1997–98 eligibility limits. As with advice and assistance, the upratings match social security benefit increases.<br><br>
The regulations will ensure that eligibility for legal aid stays in line with benefit upratings. Therefore, I commend them to the Committee.</span></p>
<p>4.32 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs Eleanor Laing <span class='memberconstituency'>(Epping Forest)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed that the Minister did not introduce the regulations in the usual way by assuring us that they are purely technical, because I have heard him say that so often before and, just for once, I would have agreed with him.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr.McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am always willing to oblige. I reassure the hon. Lady that there are no problems with the regulations and that they are indeed technical.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs Laing</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for that helpful intervention. I am delighted to agree with him, just for once, that the regulations are technical. Therefore, I do not object to their substance. I cannot, however, miss the opportunity to ask him whether he has considered the overall legal aid bill in Scotland, to which the regulations refer, and the cost to the taxpayer of legal aid.<br><br>
Again unusually, I find myself in agreement with the Government, who are earnestly trying to reduce the legal aid bill. It is pertinent to ask the Minister whether the legal aid bill is being reduced. What will be the effect of extending civil legal aid to matters arising from the Scotland Act 1998 on the overall amount of legal aid paid for by the taxpayer?</span></p>
<p>4.33 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donald Gorrie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask two questions, the first of which follows on from the point made by the Conservative spokesperson, the hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mrs Laing). When are we going to get the big picture about the Minister's plans to reform the organisation and allocation of legal aid in Scotland?<br><br>
Has any research been done on whether the limit imposed deters people with incomes that are only a little above that figure from becoming involved in legal activity? I know that it is difficult to measure, but the system should occasionally take stock to find out whether the ceiling, which is an exact and arbitrary figure, is set at the right level. Therefore, I should like reassurance that, every now and then, research is done to see that we are not preventing relatively poor people who have good cause for going to law from doing so.</span></p>
<p>4.34 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Shortly before Christmas, I had a long meeting with the West Lothian faculty of solicitors. I know that on a separate occasion, my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary also had a meeting with the faculty. It was absolutely packed—there were 40 or 50 people in the room, and all of them were bothered about the legal situation.<br><br>
This is not the occasion to go into the rights and wrongs of the matter, as it is immensely complicated. Perhaps I ought to know this, but as I do not, will the Minister explain what will happen? Will the issue be considered by the Westminster Parliament, or is the whole nest of difficulty, if I may put it that way, to be given to the Holyrood Parliament when it is set up? I should have though it more sensible to leave it to Holyrood, as it will be an on-going matter of enormous controversy. Will this difficult matter be left until after July? What are the Government's plans?</span></p>
<p>4.36 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) raised a serious issue about the complexity of legal aid and all the other aspects
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0113">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
that we are discussing. Over the past few months, we have introduced a public defender pilot in Edinburgh. We had a consultation about access to justice, covering civil legal aid, which is now complete and the findings will be dealt with later. We are dealing with fixed payments for criminal legal aid, and a range of other considerations relating to access.<br><br>
My hon. Friend is right to emphasise the importance and complexity of the matter. First, it will be wholly devolved to the Holyrood Parliament. My hon. Friend is right that after 6 May, and certainly after 1 July when the powers are transferred, the issue can be debated with legislative competence in Holyrood. In addition, in response to his question about fixed payments, there will be an early debate in this place, which will give the Committee the opportunity to discuss the wider issues of criminal legal aid and the Government's proposals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon. Friend give us any inkling of whether he has had, or is having, meetings with the Law Society and the various faculties? Is so, will those meetings continue after 1 May, or will there be meetings with whoever is responsible in the Holyrood Parliament?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Those meetings will continue. Clearly, we cannot make commitments for the new Parliament, but there have been productive discussions with all the organisations in Scotland, including the Law Society. I met the local Kirkcaldy faculty recently and there is a good relationship between the different bodies. I have also had two or three meetings with the Glasgow Bar Association.<br><br>
I believe that such meetings should continue because they are productive. Clearly, we do not agree on every issue, but there is a basic acceptance that the Government are trying to have some dialogue. My hon. Friend will be aware that on most of the issues, including the fixed payments issue, there have been discussions between the Scottish Legal Aid Board, the Law Society and Government officials. Those will continue after 6 May and 1 July. It is vital for the process that there should be partnership, dialogue and a degree of co-operation. My hon. Friend has that assurance.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Edinburgh West (Mr. Gorrie) raised the important issue of the cost of access to justice. The technical changes that we are making today merely uprate payments in line with social security. There is nothing important in that. However, we are now considering the answer to our consultation paper "Access to Justice beyond the Year 2000". The legal aid system exists only so that people for whom income is a major problem have access to justice. I reassure the hon. Gentleman that that is uppermost in my mind. When we publish the results of the consultation, the hon. Gentleman will see that that view is shared by other hon. Members in Scotland and by individuals and legal organisations.<br><br>
We have considered not only people who are completely free from having to make payments because they are under the limit, but those who are just over the limit who have to make a contribution. The
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
Scottish Legal Aid Board has been running a pilot project and is considering extending the period over which individuals can pay back their contribution. We are dealing with a group of people who are on the margin, and cost is an important factor in access to justice. The results of that pilot study will be known soon; we are talking about repayment being made over 12, 15 or 20 months. The regulations try to tackle that problem.<br><br>
We are also considering what elements of the financial criteria should be used for giving legal aid. That covers a whole range of issues, including family credit. Again, reports will be made available to the Scottish Parliament. This is an important subject, and the Government are looking closely at the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Rowe <span class='memberconstituency'>(Faversham and Mid-Kent)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister assure us that the amount of money being paid to lawyers under the scheme will increase by the same amount? The perception of many is that the incentive for legal firms to be wholly efficient is not as strong as the controls on plaintiffs' access to legal aid.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, I assure the hon. Gentleman that that is indeed the case, for practitioners and for the Scottish Legal Aid Board. When I took over the home affairs brief, I was determined that every pound of public money that was spent, no matter where it came from, should be properly accounted for and efficiently used. The Scottish Legal Aid Board now has a registration system in place. One consequence of registration is more effective scrutiny. Again, I reassure the Committee that that is the case.<br><br>
I remind the Committee that in 1987–88 we were spending £43.2 million on legal aid. In 1998–99, we shall be spending £130.9 million. That is an increase of nearly 100 per cent, in real terms. We want to maintain access to justice, but we are determined to ensure that every pound spent is spent on access to justice and not necessarily wasted in solicitors' firms. I hope that we are supported by all parties on that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a hornet's nest of a problem. Am I being thick, or can one say to the faculties, "It is no good talking to us. The matter must be held over. You would do better not to waste your time talking to Members of the Westminster Parliament. You should wait until Holyrood takes it up." Is that a fair summary?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a difficult interface for me, because my job is to deal with the problem in Westminster at least until 6 May—unless, of course, the Prime Minister has alternative news before then. Obviously some of us aspire to another place after 6 May.<br><br>
We have had excellent discussions with the faculties, with the Glasgow Bar Association and the Law Society of Scotland on the academic side of all of this. That must continue. My hon. Friend makes a valid point: it is about partnership and dialogue, but it is a complex matter and it is important to those whom we serve. We should continue to speak to the Government and to Ministers, but I hope that after 6 May a new
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0114">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
Executive will be appointed. New MSPs will be in place and they will want to continue the dialogue that we have started.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mrs. Laing) made a point on the control and the cost of legal aid I thank her for her support for our proposals. After the introduction of fixed payments, we envisage a saving of about £10 million on legal aid. That saving is not in a vacuum. Not only are we ensuring efficiency and value for money, but we have earmarked a considerable proportion of that figure for the incorporation of the European convention on human rights into Scots law. We are also keen to use some of that cash on other aspects of legal aid,—especially civil legal aid,—to which people feel there should be greater access. In addition, as part of our general aim of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
making the criminal justice system more effective, we are earmarking some of the savings for alternatives to custody.<br><br>
I therefore assure the hon. Lady that we are looking carefully at costs. We think that the savings are justified, but we must ensure that access to justice continues to be supported, not undermined.</span></p>
