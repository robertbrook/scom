	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Mrs. Joyce Quin)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft European Communities (Definition of Treaties) (North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission) Order 1999.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the draft European Communities (Immunities and Privileges of the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission) Order 1999.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The draft orders were laid before the House on 11 January 1999. The North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission is the regional fisheries organisation responsible for promoting the conservation and management of fish stocks in international waters in the north-east Atlantic. It was established, in its present form, by the convention on future multilateral co-operation in north-east Atlantic fisheries of 1980.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are six contracting parties to the convention: Denmark—on behalf of the Faroe Islands and Greenland—the European Community, Iceland, Norway, Poland and Russia. In addition, there are a number of other states, such as Canada, Japan, Korea, Latvia, Estonia and Ukraine, whose vessels fish in international waters in the north-east Atlantic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The origins of the NEAFC lie in an organisation known as the Permanent Commission which was founded in 1953. The Permanent Commission was formed under the 1946 convention for the regulation of meshes of fishing nets and the size limits of fish. However, by the early 1960s, it was considered that it needed a wider range of powers to regulate for the effects of technological advances in fishing methods. In 1963, the NEAFC was formed under the north-east Atlantic fisheries convention to succeed the Permanent Commission. In addition to the powers of the Permanent Commission, NEAFC could establish closed fishing areas and seasons, and regulate catch and fishing effort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following withdrawal from NEAFC of the member states of the European Community and the general extension of the fishery limits to 200 miles, negotiations between present and former members of the NEAFC resulted in agreement on the 1980 convention. The new convention, which entered into force in 1982, differs from the previous convention in providing for the EC to be a signatory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
Until now, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has provided the part-time secretariat of the Commission. However, in order to fulfil a greatly expanding role in fisheries management, members of NEAFC now wish to establish an independent secretariat, which is due to become operational on 1 March. Those developments have been welcomed by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From a wider perspective, keeping the NEAFC secretariat in London will help to maintain our capital as a centre for international organisations. The new secretariat, which will be located in office space available at Berners street in the west end of London, will initially have a full-time staff of three people and a budget of £500,000. Additional indirect benefits to the United Kingdom economy are expected to flow from the attendance of delegates at meetings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the EC is a party to the 1980 convention, it is a Community treaty for the purposes of the European Communities Act 1972. The headquarters agreement is ancillary to a community treaty and, therefore, comes within the terms of section 1(3) of the European Communities Act 1972. It is, therefore, proposed that the first draft order—that relating to the definition of treaties—should be made under section 1(3) of the 1972 Act, specifying the headquarters agreement as a Community treaty. This order provides the basis for the second order—that relating to the immunities and privileges of the NEAFC provided by the headquarters agreement, which the Government propose should be made under section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The headquarters agreement between the Government and the NEAFC defines the status, and specifies the privileges and immunities, that the NEAFC is to enjoy in the United Kingdom. The agreement is similar to other headquarters agreements entered into by the Government with international organisations having their headquarters in the United Kingdom, such as the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organisation, the International Maritime Organisation, the International Lead and Zinc Study Group and the Commonwealth Foundation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The privileges and immunities to be accorded to the NEAFC are those routinely given to such international organisations based in the United Kingdom. As set out in the order, the granting of immunities and privileges for the NEAFC include immunities and privileges for the NEAFC itself and for its staff members, and immunities for representatives of the members of the NEAFC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions of the headquarters agreement with the NEAFC and of the two draft orders have been scrutinised closely by the Departments concerned and have been cleared with the Cabinet Committee on immunities and privileges. The Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments has also considered the draft orders and had no comments to make. The privileges and immunities to be accorded to the NEAFC are the minimum necessary to enable the organisation to function effectively in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0544">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
I should emphasise that the privileges and immunities that will be accorded to NEAFC staff are comparable with those routinely afforded to the staff of other international organisations. I draw the Committee's attention to article 13(a) of the headquarters agreement, which confines the immunity from jurisdiction for NEAFC staff to
	<br><blockquote><p>"acts done by them in the exercise of their official functions",</p></blockquote>
and to article 17, which obliges the commission to
	<br><blockquote><p>"co-operate at all times with the appropriate United Kingdom authorities in order to prevent any abuse of the privileges and immunities and facilities provided for in this Agreement".</p></blockquote>
The Committee will also wish to know that the NEAFC plans to employ only three full-time members of staff in 1999 and that United Kingdom nationals and permanent residents of the United Kingdom would have immunity only from jurisdiction in respect of their official functions and inviolability only for their official papers and documents. The orders being considered to give effect to the headquarters agreement in United Kingdom law are not, therefore, providing for a huge increase in the number of persons enjoying privileges and immunities in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have welcomed the NEAFC's decision to locate its headquarters in London. Our decision to host the organisation sends a strong signal both to domestic and international audiences of our determination to play an active role in the conservation of fisheries resources. It helps also to underline the Government's commitment to international co-operation in fisheries management and to maintain the United Kingdom's influence in NEAFC matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have dealt with the two draft orders in some detail to try to cover some of the points that I thought that members of the Committee would want to raise. In the circumstances, I hope that the Committee will approve them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.33 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Trend 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Windsor)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for her explanation of the orders. I am sure that the Committee will agree that the position of the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission is complex as a result of its complicated history. I hope that I shall be allowed to rehearse my understanding of the position, which I think is the same as that of the Minister, as I wish to be absolutely clear about what is happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission was set up under the convention on future multilateral cooperation in north-east Atlantic fisheries of 1980, to which the European Community, as an entity, is a party. Under article 3.2 of that convention, the office of the commission is located in London. The convention was approved by the Council of Ministers in 1981 and came into force on 17 March 1982. As the Minister said, until now the commission has had a small secretariat run by officials of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food but is now to establish its own secretariat—for which a new status is required—in London. The UK is a member of the commission not in its own right but as a member of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
European Community; that is why the order has not been made under the International Organisations Acts but under sections 1(3) and 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the order is to allow the Government to give effect to those elements of the headquarters agreement that must have legal effect in the United Kingdom. What does it mean to say that the UK is a member of the commission? Are we a member in our own right as well as through our membership of the European Union? Is there a formal agreement between us and the European Union on our status as representatives of the European Union? Will we go on representing the European Union? I shall return to that subject when I speak about MAFF employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agreement will regulate relations between the commission and the UK Government as host. Among the provisions are the granting of customary privileges and immunities to any international organisation and its staff based in the UK and the endowment of a legal personality—for example, the status and attributes of a legal person—to the fisheries commission. As I understand it, that format is standard in such agreements. Not all the elements of the headquarters agreement, such as the right of the commission to display its own flag, will need to be covered by legislation, but the order is essential for those items to which legal effect must be given. The headquarters agreement has not yet been signed and has therefore not been published as a Command Paper. Will the Minister tell us when we will be able to see it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have dealt with how the changes are being made. The next question is why they are being made. The Minister gave us some, but not much detail, about why it was thought necessary to introduce the orders now. If the system of a secretariat in MAFF worked well for so long, why is it now thought necessary to establish a separate secretariat for the commission? Why cannot the present system be adapted to work with new responsibilities? What will those new responsibilities be? The Minister gave an estimate of the extra costs involved; from what fund or funds will they come? What evidence does she have that the current system is not working properly and could not cope with increased responsibilities, if there are any? What benefits does she think that the new system will achieve?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the staffing of the commission, the Minister told us that there will be three employees. Who will run the commission? Will there be any change to its administration? Will the MAFF employees currently seconded to it continue in the commission or will new staff be found? Will there be more or fewer? With just three employees, it is perhaps a difficult question to answer but it is important to know whether MAFF will continue to be represented in the same or a lesser way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Minister of my interest in whether MAFF officials will continue to represent the European Union or whether EU officials will be part of the secretariat. What is the extent of diplomatic immunity provided by the order? I have no wish to be provocative, but diplomatic immunity often makes it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0545">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
difficult to track down irregularities or fraud. She knows that Conservative MPs and Members of the European Parliament have been in the vanguard of the fight to uncover fraud in the European Union. I shall not explore that topic in detail, but I am concerned that giving diplomatic immunity to officials, possibly including those from the EU, in the commission might make it more difficult to investigate possible fraud. Will the Minister assure the Committee that the orders will not make it more difficult, or even impossible, to track cases of possible fraud?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.44 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for Windsor (Mr. Trend) for his questions and for the interest that he has taken in this matter. He knows that the matter has not created any party political difficulties. Indeed, the changes have no party political flavour; they simply reflect the fact that the members of the organisation thought it sensible to reorganise their work for the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The change is necessary because the work load of the secretariat has increased significantly in the past two years, particularly because of an increased emphasis on regional fisheries organisations regulating total allowable catches, fish stocks and so on. The hon. Gentleman is probably aware that the United Nations straddling stocks agreement encourages countries to work together to regulate catches of stocks that move between different international waters. Because of the increased work and the fact that a control and enforcement scheme based on satellite monitoring will come into force—which will involve substantially more work—the NEAFC felt it sensible to set itself up on this new basis. The UK agrees to that change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Windsor asked about the staff of MAFF. They will no longer be involved in the work of the secretariat of the NEAFC, but MAFF officials will continue to attend meetings as advisers to the European Community. He also asked about the relationship of our officials to the European Community. I stress what I said earlier—I hope that he appreciates that I tried to answer in some detail—that officials will have immunity for official acts only; they will not have general diplomatic immunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Windsor also asked about fraud—understandably so at this time. Governments and national agricultural and fisheries experts are taking a close interest in a small-scale intergovernmental organisation, so the possibility of fraud is not the same as in a large-scale organisation such as that which administers the common agricultural policy—which seems to have been designed as a fraud-friendly policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The routine immunities granted under the orders will not give rise to much fraudulent activity. If there had been evidence of fraud in the workings of the other international organisations established under these procedures, we would have seen the present arrangements in a different light. However, the organisations that I referred to are established in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
UK with limited immunities and a minimum of privileges, which are agreed at international level. That seems a sensible, normal arrangement, and not something that should give rise to anxieties about fraud or mismanagement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trend</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the staff of the newly cast NEAFC be employees of the NEAFC? Will secondments take place, either from us or from the European Union?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the commission will be responsible for appointing staff; such staff might be able to apply for such jobs because of their backgrounds in national departments. Indeed, such people would have the knowledge and expertise to be able to contribute to the commission's work. I am reminded by kind, unseen forces that the NEAFC is, and will continue to be, audited by the National Audit Office, so that helpful check remains.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall avoid the temptation to respond at length to the hon. Gentleman's suggestion that the Conservatives in the European Parliament have a monopoly of activity against fraud. As one who worked to establish the Budgetary Control Committee, as a Member of the European Parliament in 1979, I know that members of different parties have been active, despite the difficulties in getting answers to their questions. Suffice it to say that I hope that the mechanism that was set up to report back by the middle of March will result in effective action on the part of the European Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman feels on reflection that I have not responded to other points, I am happy to respond in writing and to copy those responses to other members of the Committee. We felt that it was important that the House have an opportunity to examine the order, and, indeed, we take some pleasure in that. I hope that he feels that it is worthy of his and his party's support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.51 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew George 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(St. Ives)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the Minister that I do not want to lower my contribution to a party political spat. As far as we are concerned, the order is relatively uncontroversial. We support the commission's work and endorse the order. It is important that the commission's work be encouraged in this way, as the pressure on quota stocks in nation state and European Union waters is such that stocks in deep Atlantic waters are under particular pressure. Such stocks may live for many years and reach reproductive maturity only after 20 or 30 years. It is especially important that the commission's work is encouraged so that such stocks are protected and properly regulated, as the fishing fleets of Europe will inevitably look to waters outside national and European limits to maintain their involvement in fishing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My questions relate to the United Kingdom's financial contribution to the commission. To what extent do we have, if it is appropriate to use the expression, an exit strategy in terms of the United Kingdom's long-term commitment? What mechanisms will be used to control the UK's
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0546">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
contribution in relation to other EU member states and to review the length of time over which that financial contribution is made and reviewed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.54 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention and for his general welcome for the measures before us. He is right to talk about the inexorable pressure on fish stocks. It is clear from the history of the organisation, which I briefly outlined, that the growth of its activities has been linked to technological advances in fishing equipment and consequent pressure on stocks. Those of us who come from fishing areas know how true that is. It is possible with modern fishing methods to be extremely efficient in tracking down the available stocks, and the need for fisheries conservation measures is ever greater. That is certainly true of some of the stocks for which the commission is responsible, such as blue whiting and certain types of herring, and it is likely that it will take responsibility for mackerel stocks, too. Conservation is an increasingly important area of international work.

The hon. Member for Windsor asked about United Kingdom involvement in the European Community part of the work. The European Community line on issues involving take is fixed in co-ordination between the interested member states—those affected by the work of the commission—and is consistent with the common fisheries policy. When I was first introduced to the subject, I asked how effective the organisation had been and whether we were getting value for money, and on advice received, we feel that it has worked well. MAFF officials have been involved in the past and the headquarters will continue to be in London, so we have had, and will continue to have, an influential voice in how the commission works. It is a little akin to having the presidency of the European Union in that we can influence the organisation's management. That is another reason why we were particularly pleased that it would continue to be in London. Obviously, we keep such matters under review and if we felt that the organisation was not working in our interests, we would raise the issue with our European colleagues in the European Councils and via the mechanisms of the common fisheries policy. I stress that there is no question of there being a problem at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Townend 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Yorkshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister be good enough to enlighten me? She said that the total cost of the commission is £500,000 a year. As a European institution, is it be paid for by the European Union, or do we have to make contributions to it?

Following the remarks of the hon. Member for St. Ives (Mr. George), the spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, I agree that conservation is vital. I hope that the organisation will be much more successful than the common fisheries policy, which has been a
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
complete and utter failure, with hundreds of thousands offish being thrown back into the sea every year. Despite the quota policy, which is meant to increase stocks, stocks are declining and quotas are becoming lower every year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not contribute directly to the NEAFC. Funding comes from the EC fisheries budget. Obviously, other countries will also contribute because they are members of the commission.

The hon. Member for Windsor asked whether we would be publishing the headquarters agreement. We shall do so shortly, and I shall let him know when. The hon. Member for East Yorkshire (Mr. Townend), not unsurprisingly, made some uncomplimentary remarks about the common fisheries policy. Although the hon. Gentleman and I have widely divergent views on the European Union, which we both admit to cheerfully, I am not the greatest fan of the common fisheries policy either. Many mistakes have been made in the past, but I am convinced that we need a joint approach to fisheries issues, given the movement offish stocks. Fish can be spawned in one country's waters and spend their adult life somewhere else. I always remember a Dutch Member of the European Parliament saying, "We hatch 'em and you catch 'em", when referring to stocks that were hatched off the Dutch coast and moved into our waters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is trying to tempt me into a wide debate on fisheries policy, which is not within the bounds of this discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Townend</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All I wanted to say was that Norway runs its own fishing policy and that the Norwegian fishing industry is much more prosperous than ours. Cod are much bigger in Norwegian waters than in ours.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not going to defend every aspect of fishing policy. If our economy, like Iceland's, was 90 per cent, dependent on fish, we might see European Union membership in a different light. However, as there are so many other positive aspects to EU membership, such as the need to co-operate on the conservation of fish stocks, I shall rest my case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
