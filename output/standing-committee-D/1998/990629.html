	<p>	<div class='member'>The Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to
move,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That the Committee has considered the Excise Duties (Personal Reliefs) (Amendment) Order 1999 (S.I. 1999, No. 1617).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that it would assist the Committee if I put the order in context of the decision to abolish duty free. It is a modest measure. As hon. Members will know, passengers on sea crossings or flights between European Union member states are currently able to buy duty-free goods at duty-free shops, or on board ships or aircraft, and bring them into the United Kingdom without paying excise duty. There are, of course, limits as to how much they can buy—typically, it is 200 cigarettes and a litre of spirits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The privilege of being able to buy duty-free goods on journeys within the EU will end at midnight on 30 June. That decision was not taken by the present Government, but it is one that we have to implement. Together with other EU member states, the previous Government decided in 1991 that duty-free sales should end on 30 June 1999. It must have seemed a long way in the future. Certainly, there is no evidence that between 1991 and May 1997 the previous Government gave any thought to the consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present Government, by contrast, take the duty-free issue seriously. We fought hard over the past 18 months to get the best possible deal. When, towards the end of last year, it became clear that we had the chance to achieve better arrangements for the excise duty successor regime, Ministers fought for and achieved a good deal for the duty-free industry and for travellers. We have achieved simplifications that will keep the burden of the duty-paid successor regime on business to a minimum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government supported the view expressed by a number of member states, including Germany and France, that a case could be made for a limited extension of duty frees, so that the arrangements for a successor regime could be better considered. At ECOFIN—the council of finance ministers—on 25 May, the Chancellor fully backed the French suggestion that the matter should be discussed at the Heads of Government meeting in Cologne on 3 and 4 June. By so doing, we have kept the issue alive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the past six months, the Government have successfully pressed the Commission for sensible interpretations of the law. We have secured important administrative simplifications that will help to make trade in duty-paid goods as straightforward as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Wilshire 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Spelthorne)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested to hear the Paymaster General say that there has been enormous simplification as a result of Government pressure. What simplification has been achieved?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to explain that, in order to put the order in context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government pressed the Commission for sensible interpretations of the law and secured important administrative simplifications, which will help to make the trade in duty-paid goods as straightforward as possible. In seeking a better deal, we have striven to keep the burdens on business to a minimum and to give ferry and airline operators the best chances of competing in this market. I can give the hon. Member for Spelthorne (Mr. Wilshire) the examples that he asked for in his intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When aircraft fly over several countries, the duty rate will not keep changing. Similarly, when ferries merely pass through the territorial waters of a member state without docking there, the duty rate will not change. Ferries and aircraft do not need to account for duty and claim reimbursement when goods are not available for sale—for example, on entering the territory of a high taxing member state. In those circumstances, goods can be sold at the lower taxing member state's duty rates as soon as the ferry or aircraft departs from the higher taxing member state's territory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no need for official accompanying documents—normal commercial documentation will suffice. Aircraft and ferries may continue loading goods in the United Kingdom without having to pay excise duty up front. Ferries and aircraft do not need to account for duty on individual journeys—rather, they can account on a monthly basis, in arrears. Ferries and aircraft can offset claims for reimbursement of United Kingdom duty against payments due without completing separate returns. The successor regime that will be implemented is different in those respects from that which was originally on the table six months ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the meantime, Customs and Excise has been talking to the trade to ease its transition to the new trading environment in which it will operate. The trade, of course, has lobbied long and hard to retain duty frees, if not permanently, then for a transition period. Many of its representations have focused on achieving an extension, but throughout, it has also made some representations about the nature of the successor regime, and discussions have taken place with interested parties from a cross-section of the United Kingdom duty and tax-free business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The views of the trade sector have been taken into account at all stages in determining the United Kingdom line on the abolition of duty frees and the nature of the successor regime. Customs and Excise held discussions with the trade on the administrative simplifications needed, some of which have been negotiated, as I have just described. In recognition of the logistical difficulties facing the industries in changing their retail environments to cope with the ending of duty frees, Customs and Excise has agreed some transitional arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0398">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
First, duty-free shops at ports and airports will retain their status as tax warehouses for three months, to allow them to make changes to cope with the new arrangements. During that period they will be able to sell stock purchased and held free of duty direct to members of the public, charging them the appropriate VAT and duty due on the goods. Normally, a shop would have to draw, for sale to European Union passengers, merchandise that had already been charged with excise duty. The facility is similar to that which we grant to any excise warehouse given the statutory three months' notice for closure, to allow the duty-free shop or warehouse to run down or exhaust its stocks of duty-free goods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Also, under the new arrangements, ferry operators will be required to "shut up shop" when they do not intend to make sales in United Kingdom seas. However, for a period of three months, when the shop is physically closed and no further passengers are allowed to enter, operators will be able to continue to make sales at the rates of the member state of departure to passengers who are in the shop when it closes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the co-operation of the trade, the successor regime can be made to work. Customs will continue to consult fully on all aspects of its implementation. If unforeseen practical problems arise, we will not hesitate to press the Commission for further improvements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have talked about some of the technical simplifications that we have achieved. However, I am sure that hon. Members are most concerned about the effect of the provisions on the travelling public. What difference will passengers see on 1 July? There have been many scare stories about shops closing halfway across the channel or not opening at all. The reality is unlikely to live up to those images.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards airports, the British Airports Authority has already said that it does not expect to increase prices on 90 per cent. of the product lines available in its shops. As regards aircraft, the simplification that we have achieved will mean that operators who want to sell dutiable products at prices that compete with continental shops will be able to do so 20 minutes after take-off. Those who travel on aircraft will appreciate that that is a reasonably short period. As regards ferries, operators are still working out the best way of offering their passengers the best deals. However, many will use the full range of simplifications that we have created to produce an attractive and, as they put it, competitive shopping experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must not forget that duty free will continue for passengers who travel to third countries. Within the European Union, the drinks and foods that passengers buy for consumption on board will remain tax free.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One may ask why, if we could delay the ending of duty free, we could not phase the process out over a few months Unfortunately, that was not possible, and the United Kingdom could not do so unilaterally. That would entail changing the law that comes into effect at midnight on 30 June, which would require a proposal from the Commission and unanimity among member states. As I said, customs is working closely with the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
affected industries to implement the new arrangements as straightforwardly as possible and with a light touch in the next few months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Duty-free sales for passengers who travel within the European Union come to an end on 30 June. That requires us to make several legal changes, and we are dealing with one in particular today. At present, the Excise Duty (Personal Reliefs) Order 1992 permits travellers to bring excise goods that are bought in duty-free shops at ports and airports or on board ships and aircraft into the UK without paying UK excise duty. From 30 June, there will be no need for relief from the payment of excise duty on duty-free excise goods because no duty-free goods will be available to travellers within the European Union. The amending order therefore removes the relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The personal reliefs order will continue to provide for travellers to purchase duty-paid goods in other members states and to bring them into the UK, providing that they are not for a commercial purpose. The personal reliefs order does not apply to passengers who travel from outside the European Union, who are covered by other legislation. Such passengers may continue to bring in duty-free goods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order also makes explicit the current implicit right of courts and tribunals to decide whether goods that are purchased in another member state have been brought into the UK for commercial purposes and are thus not entitled to relief from UK excise duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Together with the Value Added Tax (Abolition of Zero-Rating for Tax-Free Shops) Order 1999, which we will debate later this week, the order gives effect in UK law to the European Union legislative changes agreed in 1991 by all member states. However, customs has been consulting and will continue to consult trade interests on the working aspects of the successor regime in order to ensure that we achieve the best possible regime.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Letwin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is part of the purpose of Committees such as this to consider contentious issues, but we must also consider those which are not contentious and which relate to the detail of the legislation. I should like to begin with that detail, before dealing with the points on which the Paymaster General dwelt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Paymaster General animadverted briefly to article 3, which contains a number of issues that require discussion and further clarification. I should like to make a general point about that provision, to which the Opposition will want to return. Indeed, I hope that we shall achieve by a slow dripping on the stone a change that would be for the better in the eyes of all parliamentarians.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The drafting of article 3 is almost incomprehensible to anyone who is not a distinguished lawyer, although I know that a distinguished lawyer is present. Such provisions are not easy to draft, but it would be marvellous if they could be drafted a little more clearly. That difficulty explains why explanatory notes are provided. In considering article 3, the layman turns
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0399">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
naturally to the relevant explanatory note. Although, like any Member of Parliament, I am used to reading explanatory notes and legislative items, I must admit that I had to read this note about six or seven times before I could make head or tail of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Committee members will have studied the provisions in detail, and will no doubt share my view that it would help a great deal if the explanatory notes were actually explanatory. I know that such information is not easy to deal with within the limits of strict accuracy. I see that the Paymaster General is staring at a document that is probably the note in question. I challenge her to elucidate or to provide a clear exegesis of it, although it is clear that she knows the substance of article 3.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have managed to penetrate the meaning of article 3, with the help of the House of Commons Library. The Paymaster General has given us some description of its purpose. The Opposition do not object to it, but we believe that it contains a lacuna. As we understand it, the effect of article 3 is merely to make an implicit right, or rather power, explicit. I refer to the power of courts and tribunals to intervene and to reverse a decision made by the Commissioners, or to intervene in relation to such a decision. That change is good, because it further enshrines people's ability to challenge the Commissioners, and the Opposition have no objection to it in principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The lacuna resides in the fact that article 3 deals only with article 5 of the underlying order, the Excise Duties (Personal Reliefs) Order 1992, S.I. 1992, No. 3155. A double bind is built into that order, relating to article 3 therein, which states:
	<br><q><p>"Subject to the provisions of this Order a Community traveller"</p></q>
all of the cases in question relate to such travellers—
	<br><q><p>"entering the United Kingdom shall be relieved from payment of any duty of excise on duty free excise goods obtained by him for his own use."</p></q>
That test of own use is established by article 3.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 5 of the underlying order, to which article 3 in the order before us relates, deals with a further prohibition, so to speak, because it provides that even if someone has bought something for their own use, if the ultimate purpose they had in mind was commercial, relief is no longer granted. Thus, the structure of the underlying order is that one is granted relief if one has bought something for one's own use, but if, having bought it for one's own use, one intends to use it for a commercial purpose or to sell it to sell it on, the relief is removed. That is a perfectly reasonable construction, except that in clarifying the way in which commercial purposes are to be decided and giving a tribunal or court the ability to make a judgment on that, the double bind—that it must be for one's own use and that it must not be for a commercial purpose—has not been affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Oddly enough, although I suspect that the Paymaster General was reading from a carefully prepared draft, she nevertheless fell into an error. She said, as I think the record will show, that article 3
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
meant that people would be allowed relief on these items if they had not brought them in for a commercial purpose, but that is not strictly true; it would apply only if they had such items for their own use and not for a commercial purpose. Someone who buys something with the intention of giving it to someone else as a gift—that is, it is not being bought for a commercial purpose; it is simply a gift for granny and the person will not get reimbursed for it—at least stands in danger of being caught by the underlying order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That error is no fault of the Paymaster General. She was not around in 1992—or, rather, she was a distinguished member of the Opposition at that time and not responsible for passing the underlying order. Moreover, I suspect that the Treasury Minister at the time inherited things that probably go back a very long way. Thus, I have no complaint against the Government, but the matter needs attention. I cannot believe that it has ever been Parliament's intention that someone who conscientiously buys something while cross-border shopping and carries it into this country uncontroversially—not for personal use or for commercial purposes, but simply to give it to granny—should stand in jeopardy of not getting relief. The order fails to address that—which is not to say that it is any worse than much previous legislation in this field, but perhaps the issue could be taken up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The larger and more controversial issue on which the Paymaster General focused is duty free. Of course we accept that article 2 is a necessary consequence of the current state of affairs; there is nothing that we can possibly say to the contrary. Some such piece of legislation had to be introduced—there is no point in having relief if there is nothing to be relieved. Unfortunately, however, we cannot accept the Paymaster General's explanations—elegant and mellifluous as they were—about how the situation has arisen. There are some strong lessons to be learned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Paymaster General did not allude to a manifest absurdity in the successor regime—as she somewhat grandly called it—to which attention will be drawn over the coming months by the airline companies and, no doubt, by the popular press. We have christened it the Morocco journey.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady rightly said that if one travels outside the European Union, one will not be prohibited from duty-free sales but will be entitled to buy at duty-free rates. A flight that is destined for Gibraltar, the first leg of which takes the form of a trip to Morocco before it makes the short journey back into Gibraltar will, I think, immediately qualify. I use that as an example, but there are many more examples of the ludicrous nature of rules that mean that international travel attracts duty free while intra-community travel does not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The successor regime is simpler than it might otherwise have been, in the sense that some of the absurdities that would have been generated—the changing duty as one crosses national boundaries in air space, for example—have been eliminated. However, others remain. The Paymaster General's principal line of argument was not that the

Government, or other EU Governments, have got it right—she was cautious enough not to put it in those terms—but that the previous Government got it horribly wrong by allowing a unanimous provision to get rid of duty free on a certain date, which she described as seeming at that time to be a long way off. She described how the heroic, valiant Government battled on behalf of Britain to remedy that gross deficiency introduced by the previous Government, and claimed that the measure that was introduced was a triumph, because at least some of the absurdities that the removal of duty free would otherwise have engendered have been ironed out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a problem, to put it mildly, with that line of argument. The only way in which the original measure could have been stopped is if the previous Government had been willing to exercise the veto. That is something that the Paymaster General and her colleagues were not willing to do, and they have frequently complained over the past two years that the previous Government did it far too often. Their thesis appears to be that the Government, by employing strenuous federalism and attention to the cultivation of their colleagues in the European Union, could achieve huge negotiating successes that were entirely debarred to the previous Government with their more aggressive stance. However, we discovered to our astonishment that when that magnificent new Labour strategy was put into practice, no such grand negotiating successes were forthcoming. In fact, the deficiency that originally occurred was replicated, and the disaster continued unabated. The best that could be pulled off was the removal of some—not all—of the absurdities engendered by the change. That is a pretty poor showing for a policy that was meant suddenly to transform the United Kingdom's prospects in achieving its goals in the European Union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman explain why the previous Government agreed to the abolition of duty free—so that the deal was done and dusted— and how, without unanimity, the Government were supposed to get the matter reopened?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I can explain why the previous Government did that. It was because they were under pressure from people such as the Paymaster General, who was then in opposition, not to keep exercising the veto all the time. That was regrettable—it would have been far better had they been willing to veto the proposal. The Paymaster General cannot now complain about the previous Government's use of the veto at the same time as complaining that the previous Government were responsible for the mess. It is true, to some degree, that the previous Government, and other EU Governments, were responsible for the mess. However, the logic does not work. We are all in a bind—we have a problem when other member states want to achieve something that the UK does not want. There is absolutely no evidence from this episode to suggest that we are able to negotiate a better solution with our colleagues in the European Union by employing all this new Labour, lovey-dovey stuff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After this sorry episode, we are left with one kind of duty free that is continuing unabated—in fact, that is a vast understatement—and was much accentuated
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
under the previous Government. According to the Government's figures, £1.7 billion in duty is currently forgone on a form of duty free that is wholly illegal— illegally imported tobacco. Urgent attention must now be given to that. The issue of duty-free shopping is now, alas, much smaller in scope than that of smuggling, which is coming to our attention with increasing velocity. The Government's attitude to the raising of tax on tobacco and other items, such as liquor, is accentuating that black market wildly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall conclude by asking the Paymaster General three questions. First, is there to be an economic impact assessment of the successor regime to compare it with its predecessor, the duty-free regime? That is an EU, as much as a UK, issue. When such a change is brought about it makes sense for member states, especially the UK, to investigate its effects to determine whether it appears in retrospect to have been a good idea—because it can obviously be changed again. Will there be an impact assessment and, if so, when? Will such an assessment be conducted on a UK-wide or an EU-wide basis?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I wonder whether there will be an openness within the Treasury on its resolving of the own-use issue that I raised earlier in my remarks on article 3. Does the Paymaster General believe that that action can be advanced at an early date?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third point may seem mischievous but I mean it seriously. Does the Paymaster General consider an investigation of the whole duty-free episode worthwhile? By such a study, we may discover as much as we can about tactics that do and tactics that do not work in getting our European partners to change their minds when there is a national consensus in this country on a particular issue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Rudi Vis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Finchley and Golders Green)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was most generous of the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) to accept defeat over the issue—it boded well. He has remained consistent in his espousal of notions such as free market enterprise and level playing fields, and I thank him for that. It was good of him to argue his case on that basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to ask my hon. Friend the Paymaster General what her impressions were of the partial, minuscule references that the hon. Member for West Dorset included in his argument. He spoke about flying to Gibraltar and then swimming over to Morocco, or something like that. He spoke of purchases that might have been intended as presents, referring to them as "granny presents". He also mentioned the entirely separate, fiscal issue of the smuggling of tobacco. Will the Minister comment on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

When I get here, I feel a great urge to contribute and, on this occasion, it is actually appropriate for me to comment on article 2.

My constituency is closely involved with Heathrow airport. Until the previous general election, parts of the airfield were in the constituency of Spelthorne; minor alterations were made as a result of boundary changes. I now represent only the edge of the airport. However, that part is significant to the order because large numbers of stores, duty-free bonds and catering and aircraft stores businesses that service the airport are there. They provide the airport with the goods that we shall have to discuss.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some tens of thousands of my 70,000 constituents work at Heathrow airport or owe their living to its success. It is hard to be precise, but the number of people who depend on the duty-free business at Heathrow is certainly in the high hundreds, if not in the low thousands. The issue of duty free might seem trivial to some, but to those whose livelihood is at risk and to their families, it is of great concern, whoever is to blame for the present situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In fairness, I should say that I also represent many of the Customs officers who will now have to deal with what the Minister has spoken about. I try to keep in close touch with them, and I know that they are trying to be as reasonable as they can be during what will be difficult weeks or months. I wish them well
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The abolition of duty free, the order and everything that flows from it will have a serious effect on Heathrow airport. Not to put too fine a point on it, there will be significant chaos in some parts of that airport for some time to come. Let us consider people using terminal 1, from which British Airways operates virtually all of its European services. The great majority of those people will no longer be able to buy duty free, but those on British Airways services to Norway or Russia will want to do so. I shall ask the Paymaster General some questions on that in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the other European airlines operate from terminal 2, which has exactly the same problem. After 1 July, the overwhelming majority of passengers who go through terminal 2 will no longer be entitled to duty free, but a significant minority will. The same pandemonium will almost certainly break out there. Arguments will ensue as to what people are and are not entitled to. The matter does not depend simply on where one is going, as the layman would sometimes have us believe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The one place secure from too much disruption is terminal 3, where the foreign airlines that run intercontinental routes operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There shall not be much difficulty there. One might think that the same argument would apply to terminal 4, from which British Airways operates its intercontinental services. However, a significant minority of services that operate from it are European, so there will be a fair degree of difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are heading for a difficult period. I appreciate that Her Majesty's Customs and Excise and the Treasury have tried to minimise what will happen, but I do not think that they have succeeded as well as they should have done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
I am a realist. I accept what has happened and that we cannot do anything about it this afternoon. However, the order adds insult to injury. When the Labour Government were elected and afterwards, we were assured that there would be a great effort to reverse the decision on duty free. A great deal was made of that. I remember debates on the Floor of the House in which we were assured that all would be well on the matter under the new Labour Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that we were not assured simply that all would be well, but that all would be well because of the new stance of deep co-operation and hence greater influence that would be taken?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilshire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would love to go down that route, Dr. Clark, but I have a nasty feeling that you would rapidly say that we were not here to debate the stupidity of the European Union in general. As you would not let me get away with that, I shall not try it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After all the promises of a reprieve by the incoming Government, they have resoundingly failed to deliver. Given the publicity about what would be achieved, it would have been reasonable to expect that we would have had an opportunity to consider such a matter on the Floor of the House, but oh, no. In order that the public were not too aware of the Government's failing, the matter was shuffled upstairs in the hope that no one would draw attention to it</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Finance Bill is being considered on Report next week and the hon. Gentleman will have the opportunity to debate the matter then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilshire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to know that I can make the same points all over again. Perhaps there will be double publicity. I had not anticipated that bonus. Nevertheless, the matter has been shuffled upstairs, and so far the Government have managed to avoid the Floor of the House. A decision could be made this afternoon to lessen the damage that will be done by the abolition of duty free. Article 2 suggests that value added tax should be applied to—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not discussing a VAT order today, but an order on excise duty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilshire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to know that we will have another go at that topic in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is perfectly possible in general terms for the Government not to take the consequential decisions once duty free has been abolished. They could say, "We won't add an extra burden to what is imposed by Brussels. We will allow an exemption or exception to the rule either permanently or temporarily to see how things go." I think that the whole matter will backfire anyway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to be absolutely clear that I understand some of the points that the Paymaster General made. The hon. Lady said that duty free shops—in effect, bonded warehouses—will retain their status for three months. What will happen then? Let us suppose that the duty-free shops in terminals 1 and 2 will stay as such for three months and that duty will be paid afterwards. Is she saying that, at the end of three months, they will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0402">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
no longer be duty-free shops and that all their produce will be duty paid?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen if I go through terminal 1 to Norway? Will BAA or its franchisee sell me duty-paid goods that I can take to Norway at duty-free prices? Will the organisation have to fill in vast amounts of paper to claim back the duty? If that will not happen, I should be most grateful if the Paymaster General can clarify whether there will have to be duty-free shops in terminals 1 and 2 and elsewhere even though the great bulk of the business in the terminals will be duty-paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for ships, the hon. Lady said that the shop on board a ship would have to close only when the ship entered British waters and that a temporary arrangement would be made to accommodate that requirement. What will happen if there is an enormous queue outside the duty-free shop when the 12-mile limit hoves into view? Will the skipper go round in circles until either the stock is sold or all those in the queue are satisfied? If so, the Paymaster General must consult Her Majesty's Coastguard to work out the risk to shipping in the English channel. Knowing ferry companies as I do, there will be an enormous temptation to maximise the sales of such products because companies will lose a huge amount of revenue as a result of the crazy decision that was made in Brussels. The Paymaster General must understand that. What steps is she taking to ensure that ships do not go round in circles until all the duty-free products has been sold?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the Paymaster General said that drinks consumed on board would be duty free. That was news to me and I was pleased to hear it. However, I am trying to work out the logic in such practice, because the same duty-free product will still be landed, but in a different container. If that is true, what will happen in respect of duty-paid products that are brought on to a ship or an aircraft, but which are sold subsequently for consumption? They will have been brought on to such vessels with the duty paid but, by being drunk, they will have been turned into a duty-free item. Will there be refunds of duty in such circumstances? How will the staff of the ship or aircraft know which of the items sold duty paid were landed unopened and which items were drunk? There will clearly be a different duty status, depending on what happens to the item sold in the ship or on the aircraft. The hon. Lady boasted that matters would be simplified, so perhaps she can explain how that conundrum will be resolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be grateful if the hon. Lady would clarify three further queries. First, how will Customs and Excise know where certain products are purchased as distinct from where they are loaded? The requirement will be to state where the item was loaded. If a bottle of scotch is loaded in Dover, it will come under a different duty regime to that of a bottle of scotch that is loaded in Calais. I understand the minds of the traders. The hon. Member for Finchley and Golders Green (Dr. Vis) said that those of us who believe in commerce, business and competition will work out quickly that one possibility will be for large quantities of duty-paid items to be purchased in one country, shipped in bulk to another and loaded on to an aircraft or ship. If the point of purchase were at issue, the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
products would have been purchased somewhere else, while the records could easily show where they had been loaded. That will give rise to potential problems and I should be grateful if the Paymaster General could clarify how the Government intend to handle the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, what thought has been given to the dangers of the unlimited sale of duty-paid products at airports before take-off? The number of glass bottles full of highly inflammable liquid hurtling around the skies has been controlled partly because of the limit imposed by duty-free shops. I applaud BAA for saying that it will keep its prices low. Some people might say that that shows how much profit it makes, but that is not relevant to the debate. However, if bargain bottles of scotch or gin—or whatever your tipple might be, Dr. Clark—are available at Heathrow and people can buy as much as they like, even more glass bottles full of inflammable liquid will be hurtling around the skies. That is a dangerous thing for us to encourage. I know that there are difficulties, but, given that duty free will no longer exist, the obvious solution is to allow people to purchase bottles of gin or scotch on arrival at airports. That would solve the safety problem and help the environment, as less aviation spirit would be used in flying all those bottles about as well as the passengers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, can the Minister answer what I know as the Basel-Mulhouse question, which is like the west Lothian question. There are other examples, but I know this one best. Under an international treaty, Basel-Mulhouse airport is the sovereign territory of neither France nor Switzerland. The Germans are getting in on the act, and Frieburg is joining in. The airport is technically in France but has international status. The duty-free shop at Basel sells goods in Swiss francs and is operated by a Swiss company. Most of us would assume that the duty-free arrangements are Swiss.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be easy to say that those arriving at Mulhouse airport from France come from the European Union, but those arriving at Basel airport—exactly the same place—from Switzerland do not come from the EU. However, if I buy a ticket from Crossair or British Airways and fly to that airport, the ticket states that I am going to Basel. When I buy my ticket, I am not asked where I plan to go when I leave the airport. The airline simply lands me at the airport—an international space. Therefore, I assume that I can buy duty free on that aircraft, although I am going to France. If so, what instructions would the Minister give the aircraft's cabin crew on what they could sell to whom?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, when I return through an airport such as Basel, I enter through France or Switzerland and present myself to the French or Swiss frontier police, who dutifully look at my passport and send me on into a common area. Regardless of whether I come from Switzerland or France, I merge with other people and descend on the duty-free shop. Will the duty-free staff at places such as Basel be instructed that they must ask me to prove where I have come from? Must I prove that I have come from Switzerland, rather than France, before they will take my money? Such
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0403">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
nonsense has not been sorted out, despite the Minister's protestations that, somehow, a simple system has miraculously been put in place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We could have made the position a little less nasty this afternoon. Questions remain to be answered. I hope that the Minister will answer the questions that I have asked. The proposals might backfire because, if people cannot receive all the benefits of duty free, they might stop buying and the Government's plans for their income will be ruined. Alternatively, people might start buying more abroad and less here. People are being offered another opportunity to bring in duty-paid goods, reducing the Government's revenue and adding insult to injury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have always viewed the proposals as attempt to ruin a harmless bit of fun. Duty free has created many jobs. Significant numbers of my constituents are now threatened with the dole because of EU interference and the Government's failure to deliver on a promise that they made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order will affect not only my constituents, but everyone who travels. Without the profit margin in duty free that was available when people enjoyed their harmless bit of fun, the ultimate bottom line of this wretched little exercise will be an increase in fares.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cheltenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Until the hon. Member for West Dorset got to his feet, I thought that I understood the order. Fortunately, however, the hon. Member for Spelthorne brought me back to sanity. I encourage him to visit Committee Corridor more often, because not only was his speech entertaining, but he made some interesting points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall confine my remarks to article 2 of the order. The hon. Member for West Dorset asked for an impact assessment, and I second that request. We shall need to know what measures the Minister has in place to monitor the effects of the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the order. The abolition of duty free is right, because duty free distorts the single market. Non-travellers have subsidised travellers, or, to put it another way, the pensioner in the pub in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed) has subsidised my hon. Friend, who has travelled. That is wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government will make some savings from the order. I should, perhaps, declare my interest as chairman of the all-party beer club. Brewing industry specialists estimate that the Government will save between £600 million and £700 million a year. Perhaps the Paymaster General will comment on that, because I have been unable to elicit any such number through parliamentary questions. If the Treasury will make a large amount of money, the public have a right to know what the Government will do with it. Will it disappear into Treasury coffers, or will it benefit the population at large, and not only the travellers who have benefited until now?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
The windfall presents the Government with a wonderful opportunity to make themselves popular if they use it in respect of duty-free goods. For example, £600 million is the equivalent of 6p on a pint of beer. If they were to cut beer prices by 6p a pint, they would be assured of victory at the next election. It would also bring some comfort to people who drink that product in the UK. It would be a welcome relief to the brewing industry in Britain, which, as the hon. Member for West Dorset said, has been suffering from smuggling: 1.7 million pints of beer a day come across the channel, half of which are sold on illegally. It is big business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard some alarmist stories about the impact of duty free, that is why we need the impact assessment. Some of those stories may be true; some may not. While travelling here today, I listened to an excellent programme on BBC Radio 4, "You and Yours". It included quite a long piece about the order and the abolition of duty free, in which people who operate duty-free outlets suggested that it would not make much difference. A gentleman from Heathrow airport said that he thought that they will sell as much, because they will probably sell more bottles per person. He also said that they will freeze their prices for a period, which will come as a welcome relief to travellers during the summer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will the Paymaster General assess the order's impact? Has she received an estimate of any savings that the Treasury might make? How will she monitor those savings? Does the Treasury plan to redistribute those savings to cushion the impact on the industries that may be affected?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Dorset spoke about Gibraltar and Basel. People do fly to Switzerland and travel onward to other countries. My constituency of Cheltenham has a twinning link with Annecy, and those who go on the annual trip who do not go by bus fly to Geneva and then travel to Annecy. I hope that the Paymaster General will be able to explain how the order will affect those people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilshire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for mentioning Gibraltar.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know the answer, and I am a member of the all-party group on Gibraltar.

represent his constituency. He took off on a rhetorical flight, but he had a bad landing in terms of what he understands about duty free and about what will happen from 30 June.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall try to answer the points raised about Gibraltar, Morocco and Basel, as well as about what is implicit and what is explicit. I believe that this is the first time that the hon. Member for West Dorset has spoken in Committee since his promotion to the Front Bench, so I congratulate him on that move. I would really look forward to debating with him if he were to congratulate the Government rather than oppose them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to the question of implicit, explicit and the double test. The double test is deliberate. It was not the intention of the draftsman that gifts would escape. The law is clear that goods must be for personal consumption. The effect of the order is that if goods are relieved because they are imported for non-commercial purposes, but the purpose is subsequently changed to a commercial one, the condition for relief is breached and duty becomes chargeable. That has always been the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the hon. Lady misunderstood me, but I am surprised to hear her diving back into her speech on commercial purpose. Giving a gift to granny is not a commercial purpose. That, surely, is not in doubt. The question is why the hon. Lady should believe that it is appropriate that someone should be caught by the additional duty if they are not buying for themselves, but buying a genuine gift.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the law is personal consumption. That has always been the case and it remains so. The hon. Gentleman does a disservice to his point. Surely the intent of personal consumption must be clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to ask the hon. Lady to think about it, but is that the right result? Will that not cast the law into disrepute? There is not the slightest chance of an excise official being able to determine whether somebody has brought in a small quantity of goods for his own use or as a gift for his grandmother. It is odd that people will be acting illegally if they bring something in and then decide to give it to their grandmothers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot assist the hon. Gentleman when he does not understand the law as it has operated and makes the most bizarre points. The law is unchanged, and goods have to be for personal consumption. The hon. Gentleman paints a scenario in which we will somehow terrorise everyone who brings in something for his granny, but that is simply not true. We are talking generally about how the regime works. When a member of the public brings an amount of duty-paid that is under the millilitre limit into this country, it must be for his personal consumption; otherwise, it is outside the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not suggest that the provision was new; if the Minister reads the record, she will see that I said that it was in the previous order. I am asking whether it is right. The hon. Lady is a Minister of the Crown and does not have to rely on an exegesis of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
present state of the law; she can investigate whether it is sensible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it is sensible. It has operated until now, and it is quite clear why it is sensible. The ridiculous situation that has been described has not occurred, and there is no problem. We must try to hold on to some concept of the reality of the trade when we discuss the order, which does only one thing—it removes duty free.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Dorset asked about an economic impact assessment and the likely effects of the new regime. I made it clear in my opening remarks that Customs continues to work closely with traders, as the hon. Member for Spelthorne acknowledged. A new regime will have to be implemented. It is quite reasonable that we should examine the effect of the new arrangements after six months to allow time for the system to bed down. We are not aware that the European Commission intends to evaluate or revisit the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the hon. Member for West Dorset referred to the huge bonanza or revenue that the Government would reap; the hon. Member for Cheltenham (Mr. Jones) certainly referred to it. The hon. Member for Cheltenham suggested that we should spend that money on cutting the price of beer by 6p a pint. I do not drink beer, but I am sure that many people will be pleased at the suggestion that Liberal Democrat policy for the next election will be to spend £600 million to reduce the cost of a pint of beer. However, the figure that the beer club uses is the known figure for the total amount of duty and VAT that the Government forgo under the present arrangements—about £550 million a year. However, for that to become income—as opposed to a loss—to the Government, we must assume that everybody buys exactly the same quantity at our duty rates and VAT rate. The advertisements put out by the ferry companies and the response of BAA show that they intend to keep a presence in this highly competitive market and find ways of legitimately selling to travellers reduced price goods that they can buy when they go on holiday or return home. It is not the case that we can now count on that forgone revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Trying to work out the effect on future revenue depends on the nature and development of the successor regime. I am not aware that the Treasury is about to receive a huge input that I will salt away in my desk and then spend on something else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Heald 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Hertfordshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Treasury made a projection?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not possible to make a projection of what may happen to revenue with all the changes to the sales points that are to be offered by the operators.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilshire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I heard her correctly, the hon. Lady said that she was prepared to review the situation after six months. In the meantime, I am sure that she will appreciate that there is great scope for things to go horribly wrong in ways that we had not anticipated. Can she give us an assurance that HM Customs and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0405">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
Excise will be understanding, sympathetic and generous rather than draconian in seeking to apply the absolute letter of the law to unforeseen difficulties that might crop up in that six-month period?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made it clear in my opening remarks that Customs and Excise was working very closely with operators, and would continue to do so. I also made it clear that as well as the additional transitional sales points arrangements that will be introduced, Customs and Excise will be using a light touch.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is appropriate to make my third point to the hon. Gentleman now rather than later as he wanted to concentrate on Heathrow airport. The BAA and other operators have welcomed the transitional arrangements, particularly those that allow them to keep warehouse status for three months. They will work with Customs and Excise in the next few weeks and beyond on how best to put these arrangements in place. I think that what will emerge will be a mix of duty-free and duty-paid goods. However, it is impossible to forecast what innovative means commercial operators will develop to protect their trade, because they are not always forthcoming about matters that they consider commercially sensitive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What measures is the Minister putting in place to monitor the effects of the abolition, particularly on the Treasury? I am concerned that any financial benefit to the Treasury will disappear into a black hole rather than be recycled into British industries that might be suffering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister spoke of ferry companies wishing to continue to sell cheap goods, but our duty rates are much higher than those on the continent. Is the Minister not making the case for harmonisation? If so, why did the Government increase beer duty by 1p on 1 January?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman noticed, but our VAT rates are lower. It might have crossed his mind that commercial decisions will involve consideration of the rate of both VAT and duty. He might not believe it, but it is conceivable that companies will still make a profit and still wish to provide the facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want repeat again my remarks about the arrangements put in place by the Government. We intend to work closely with the operators, and to review how the situation develops to learn whether we need to return to the Commission to get additional changes. We shall continue to strive to achieve a sensible successor regime working in practice. The hon. Member for Cheltenham knows that he can continue to table parliamentary questions on estimates of revenue to the Treasury. He knows also that that income will become clear in details of Government finances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the producers want to advance the simple argument that everything that they do not like is bad, and the Treasury must be making a killing and getting in extra money. As I have tried to explain to the hon. Gentleman, Government income is dependent
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
on how producers respond commercially and on how travellers respond in terms of what they purchase. Given that the abolition of duty free has not occurred—that the new regime is not in place and so is not yet bedded down—some of his questions cannot accurately be answered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to turn to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Finchley and Golders Green and by several other hon. Members about smuggling. The question of smuggling is not connected to that of duty free. Smuggling takes several different forms. Some of it is in the form of diversion fraud, in which items that should be exported are not or re-enter the country when they should not. Such fraud occurs on a massive criminal scale. As my hon. Friend will know, the Government have taken several steps to tackle the issue, including initiating the review completed last June and putting in extra customs officers to investigate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is not simply one of duty; neither is it one of a huge problem occurring in member states that have a high duty regime. For instance, Italy has a problem with smuggling and its duty rates are lower than ours, and the smuggled goods come from outside the European Union. Belgium has a well quoted problem of hand rolling tobacco being smuggled into the country. The problem involves pricing, regulation and about dealing with criminal activity, which, as I have said, the Government take seriously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady mentioned the steps that the Government have taken. Will she tell the Committee when the smuggling Tsar, announced some months ago, will be appointed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Chancellor—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister would be advised not to follow the questioner into a discussion that would be out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Dr. Clark, for your keeping me in order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Spelthorne made the point about jobs, and expressed concerns about his constituents; we must all surely share such concerns about our constituents and their future secure employment. He painted a view of possible disaster that cannot be fairly suggested now. We are considering an industry that forecast massive problems, jobs losses, rises in fares and distortion and disruption in the sale of duty-free and duty-paid goods. The same industry has spent the past few weeks advertising new ways of getting to and from Calais as an exciting opportunity to spend money. The BAA has made clear that 90 per cent. of the goods that it has on sale will continue to be sold at the reduced prices applicable now. It will become clear that the people who forecasted disaster are now getting on with the commercial reality and with making new arrangements for it. Those people will continue to be so employed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Spelthorne also mentioned queues in shops, and asked whether cross-channel ferries will chug in circles in the middle of the English channel while a queue gets shorter. First, I do not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0406">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
think that any ferry captain would be irresponsible enough to contemplate such an action. Secondly, as I said, only people who are inside the shop when it closes will be able to continue to buy the goods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hesitate to say it, but the idea that British business would engage in the folly envisaged by the hon. Member for Spelthorne in arrangements for the commercial sale of its products is quite incredible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilshire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the Minister says. Does she have a definition of "shop" as it applies to a ship? If there is no such definition, a ferry company could designate an entire ship as its shop and all the passengers would be inside it. There has to be a proper legal definition of what constitutes the shop where one must be to purchase the goods.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Next week, we shall have the opportunity to discuss the successor regime on the Floor of the House. It has been discussed and agreed with the operators, and it makes clear their continued understanding of what constitutes a shop. The hon. Member for Spelthorne may be confused by that, but I can assure him that the operators are not confused and that they are fully aware of the administrative arrangements that will be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked a question about the sale of duty-free goods in Basel. The simple answer to his question is yes. Assuming that I should give a slightly fuller answer, I should tell him that anyone who flies to Basel can obtain duty-free goods there because it is not situated within the European Union. Whether one catches a train or travels anywhere else after obtaining such goods is irrelevant. Those are the arrangements that are in place. It is incredible, and it was a loss to the previous Conservative Government, that the hon. Gentleman was not able to bring to bear his incisive views on the operation of duty free or a successor regime before the abolition was agreed to. On our election, this Government were faced with trying to undertake the preparation that the previous Government failed to carry out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about duty-free consumption on board. I shall not enter into discussion about what counts as a receptacle or about whether goods are not for personal consumption if they have already been consumed. Duty-free consumption on board is permitted under European directives. The goods for consumption on board—whether or not they are confused with goods for take-away, which have to be duty paid—will be sold only from bars and restaurants. Cigarettes will be sold only in packets of 20 and alcoholic drinks only by the glass or small bottle—I hope that it is immediately obvious to all Committee members that those quantities are for personal consumption only.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady will know that everyone always said with regard to licensing hours that it was a terrible mistake to legislate for a very short period in which people could drink themselves silly, and that it would be much more sensible to relax the hours. Is she not creating the potential problem of youngsters going on trips and drinking vast amounts of alcohol at cheap rates during restricted hours? Does she not think that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
the measure will increase the kind of publicity that we have seen recently about badly behaved passengers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The arrangements for the sale of alcohol on board aircraft and ships operate already. There are restrictions in place and there is no change to that. While I accept that hon. Members want to explore the order, I implore them not to take us into the realms of farce by imagining the most incredible arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Spelthorne asked about the quantity of duty-paid goods that could be carried on to an aircraft. I am sure that he is aware that aircraft companies severely restrict, by weight and size, the amount that one can carry on to an aircraft. They will continue to do that. I think that they will be able to spot a crate of beer or 12 bottles of whisky that do not fit into the overhead locker.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilshire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way? It is a serious point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will be the first.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilshire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suppose that I asked for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the hon. Lady aware of the recent case of someone at Heathrow who bought 15 wooden cases of wine which the airline willingly took into the hold? Thus, even before the change comes into effect, there are examples of serious quantities of alcohol being taken on to aircraft. This measure could make matters worse. It is not just what can be put into overhead lockers, but the amounts that can be taken into the holds, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the hon. Gentleman wanted to raise a serious point. Everyone knows that aircraft companies restrict amounts to those which they believe it is safe for passengers to carry on to the aircraft, and they will continue to do that. It is a matter of security for the airlines, not a concern for the Government. Any reasonable person can see that that airline companies will prevent such quantities being carried on to their aircraft, if only out of self-preservation in terms of the comfort and security of their other passengers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order removes duty free from UK law, following a unanimous agreement to abolish duty free which the previous Government made with the 14 other member states. That agreement was legally binding on this Government, although we sought to have the matter reviewed and to encourage the other member states to agree to delay implementation of the change so that we had a longer period in which to implement a sensible successor regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government were always clear that duty free would go as part of the single market. After intense discussions with our European partners, member states that since 1991 had made provision to implement the abolition of duty free—although the previous Government did not do so—felt that it was unreasonable, given that they had made those arrangements, that we should now seek to reopen the matter. We—along with France and Germany—could not persuade them to do so. In the absence of unanimous agreement to reopen the issue, the Government strove to ensure arrangements for the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0407">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
transition period that would support business and minimise disruption to travellers, and to provide a successor regime that would work and be clear to traders in terms of their obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members should have spent a little more time informing themselves of the facts, rather than the fantasy. If they had done so, I am sure that they would appreciate that—given the circumstances that the Government inherited—the arrangements that have been made are the best that could have been hoped for. They will ensure that traders and travellers are supported during this period of the abolition of duty free.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
