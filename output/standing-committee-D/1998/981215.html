Draft Criminal Legal Aid (Scotland) (Prescribed Proceedings) Amendment (No. 2) Regulations 1998</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Home Affairs and Devolution, Scottish Office (Mr. Henry McLeish)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Criminal Legal Aid (Scotland) (Prescribed Proceedings) Amendment (No. 2) Regulations 1998.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span>: With this it will be convenient to discuss the draft Advice and Assistance (Assistance by Way of Representation (Scotland) Amendment (No. 2) Regulations 1998.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It might be useful to the Committee if I explain in brief detail the regulations that we are considering. I will deal first with the regulations that concern assistance by way of representation. These regulations extend the availability of assistance by way of representation—which is a form of advice and assistance—as a consequence of the restriction of liberty orders and drug treatment and testing orders through the Crime and Punishment (Scotland) Act 1997 and the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 respectively.<br><br>
First, we propose that assistance by way of representation should be available to cover all proceedings in relation to the variation or revocation of a restriction of liberty order, or as the case may be, the failure to comply with any of the requirements of the restriction of liberty order, under the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995.<br><br>
Secondly, we propose that assistance by way of representation should be available to cover all proceedings in relation to the variation or revocation or review of a drug treatment and testing order; or the failure to comply with any requirement of a drug treatment and testing order, under the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995. Assistance by way of representation is the most straightforward means to ensure that legal aid is available in relation to such proceedings.<br><br>
The Criminal Legal Aid (Scotland) (Prescribed Proceedings) Amendment (No. 2) Regulations 1998 are entirely consequential on the extension of assistance by way of representation. The proposed changes remove the availability of criminal legal aid for proceedings in relation to the variation or revocation of a restriction of liberty order or the failure to comply with any of the requirements of a restriction of liberty order. Similarly, criminal legal aid will no longer be available for proceedings in relation to the variation or revocation or review of a drug treatment
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
and testing order or the failure to comply with any requirement of a drug treatment and testing order. Those changes will ensure that there is no duplication in the system and that no administrative inefficiencies are introduced.<br><br>
The regulations make provision for useful improvements to the system of legal aid in Scotland. I therefore commend them to the Committee.</span></p>
<p>4.32 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oliver Letwin <span class='memberconstituency'>(West Dorset)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am beginning to feel that there must be some form of conspiracy. I have so far been privileged to lead the Opposition's scrutiny of four sets of statutory instruments proposed by the Scottish Office, and, struggle as I may, in none of them—including these—have I been able to find the slightest defect. That suggests either that I am proverty-struck in my imagination, or that the Scottish Office is carefully concealing a set of dastardly, dangerous and controversial regulations which it will bring before us in a great panoply, having lulled us into a false sense of security. I cannot find any objection to the regulations, so I shall not waste the Committee's time further.</span></p>
<p>4.33 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donald Gorrie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The regulations seem all right. Can the Minister reassure us that, in the change to giving certain types of alleged offenders assistance by way of representation rather than legal aid, they do not suffer a deal that is in any way less good? I am not very aware of this field. If the regulations are merely a technical change from the one to the other, I, like the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin), can see nothing wrong with them.</span></p>
<p>4.34 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Most of us who are not legal eagles find ourselves somewhat at a loss when we read documents such as these. I was listening carefully to what my hon. Friend the Minister said; the regulations appear to be about avoiding duplication. Can he confirm for my satisfaction that they will not cause any detriment to the person concerned? I ask that question especially because I received a letter today from Michael Clancy, who is well known to all of us. He is anxious about the possibility of restricting access to justice through the unlimited eligibility criteria. I should be glad to hear the Minister's views about that.</span></p>
<p>4.35 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLeish</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I give the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Gorrie) the assurance that he seeks. The advice by way of representation scheme is tailor-made to suit proceedings that are straightforward in character but which nevertheless require court appearances. Advice by way of representation is a type of advice and assistance administered by solicitors, involving less expensive paperwork, which is much appreciated the legal profession. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the provisions do not attempt to cut corners.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0207">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) asked about undermining access to justice. The regulations do not do that; they seek to take the orders that they affect into the category of advice by way of assistance, and to ensure that no double
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
counting occurs in the criminal legal aid system. I give my hon. Friend a total reassurance that the regulations aid the system, and are in no way to its detriment.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Resolved.</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Advice and Assistance (Assistance by Way of Representation) (Scotland) Amendment (No. 2) Regulations 1998.</p></blockquote></p>
