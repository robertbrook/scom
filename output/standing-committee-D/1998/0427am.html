MEASURES TO REDUCE UNDER-OCCUPATION BY HOUSING BENEFIT CLAIMANTS</div> <!-- title -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies <span class='memberconstituency'>(Grantham and Stamford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 294, in page 57, line 15, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(d) for ensuring that, in relation to a housing benefit claimant who is disabled, due account is taken of his need for additional space, including an extra bedroom for a carer.'.</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) asked me to move the amendment, although he will discuss other matters arising from the clause. He may have asked me to do so because I originally conceived of it. I hope, even at this late stage in our proceedings, that the Government will not be disinclined to accept it. I hope that they think that it is platitudinous and that it states the obvious.<br><br>
A carer's role may be recognised by the fact the taxpayer subsidises invalid care allowance, and it may have been decided that someone cannot live at home without a carer. I am sure that the Government do not want to preside over a system of housing benefit that results in a disabled person who needs a carer being told, as a result of the housing benefit rules, that he or she is over-housed because he or she had a spare room, which was needed for the carer.<br><br>
That point is so obvious that I need not labour it. I should be extremely disappointed if the Government do not accept the amendment. Their only possible line of exit might be to say, "The amendment is not needed. We shall ensure that regulations provide the protection that the Conservative Opposition are seeking." If they give that assurance, which should be entirely unambiguous, we shall examine it carefully.<br><br>
Representations from outside the House and Opposition Members have made it clear that one problem with the Bill is that it has caused the most profound anguish and disquiet in the minds of disabled people. Those who are currently on incapacity benefit will be protected, but those who face the onset of a debilitating condition—perhaps a terminal condition that may not terminate their life for many years—are extremely worried about the Government's proposals. The Government are not ashamed of raising money by screwing down the benefits that are available for the disabled. They are changing the qualification criteria for benefits with the deliberate objective of filtering out those who currently qualify either as a result of the all-work test or of a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 986</span>
person's national insurance contributions. There is tremendous worry about the fact that those who are currently disabled or who fear that they may be in future will suffer as a result of the Government's proposals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman seems to be alone on the Opposition side of the Committee—no one else there is paying any attention to him, as they are too busy having conversations.<br><br>
As it is likely to get warm in the Room, gentlemen who wish to remove their jackets may do so—I shall not make those who have already done so put them back on. Ladies need no such permission.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall take advantage of that licence with gratitude.<br><br>
The amendment is required for the reasons that I have stated. The Bill needs to contain an explicit assurance to prevent the Government from using further opportunities to deprive disabled people of benefits to which they are currently entitled, and to which they ought—by any humane consideration—to remain entitled.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security (Mr. Stephen Timms)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Now that the shadow Chancellor has made it clear that the Conservative party supports the Government's spending plans for health and education, is the hon. Gentleman saying that his party supports higher spending on social security benefits than those that the Government propose?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before I call the hon. Gentleman, may I suggest that he does not follow that red herring, as it does not have immediate relevance to the amendment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On what may be the last day of our proceedings, Mr. McWilliam, in the interests of even-handedness and natural justice which you hold so close to your heart, I am sure that you would not allow the Minister to ask me a question but then deprive me of the chance of even a brief answer, so that it would appear from the record that I had been unable or unwilling to answer, and that the Opposition had simply evaded the point. Therefore, with your consent, Mr. McWilliam, I shall make it clear to the Minister that, during our deliberations on the Bill, the Conservative party has not proposed any significant spending increases, with one or two exceptions. We have attempted to preserve the status quo.<br><br>
We have not supported the Government's objective of taking £800 million out of the current benefit entitlements of the disabled, over the long term. That figure comprises £700 million, according to the Government's figures, in respect of incapacity benefits—or £750 million, according to the estimates of some charities and voluntary groups—and £100 million from the abolition of severe disablement allowance. Even I can add seven and one to make eight—£800 million—so the Under-Secretary of State for Social Security, the hon. Member for City of York (Mr. Bayley) had better stop shaking his head.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I1012">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 987</span>
The Conservative party does not support that project, and regards it as a disreputable attack on the weakest and most vulnerable people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are out of order. We are dealing with the question of whether the additional space required by disabled people and their carers will be affected by the clause, and only that question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will come straight back to order, Mr. McWilliam, but I think that you will acknowledge that it was not I who widened the scope of the debate.<br><br>
We all know disabled people. Some of us have disabled family members, all of us have disabled friends and consituents. One of the fine achievements of the welfare system over the last generation—it is not, perhaps, coincidental that a Conservative Government were in office for most of that time—has been to move away from the prevailing idea that people in that position were better off institutionalised or hospitalised for life. We now do everything possible to ensure that such people remain at home and lead a normal life, and that if their condition improves they may be able to return to a completely normal life, although that is unlikely, as I have already pointed out to the Committee.<br><br>
It is a prerequisite for many such people living at home that they have a full-time carer, who must therefore have a bedroom at home. The idea of a carer sharing a room with a disabled person, or sleeping on the sofa in the living room, is appalling. We realise the stresses and strains and, in some cases, the physical difficulties and unpleasantness, that carers are willing to take on in order to carry out their task—a fine task, almost a sacred one—of caring for someone who would otherwise be unable to live at home and who would have to live in an institution such as a hospital or nursing home. The state should therefore acknowledge, as a basic minimum, that such a carer should have at least a room of his or her own, to retreat to and sleep in undisturbed. That is absolutely vital. Despite the extremely unpleasant things that the Government are doing to the disabled in this country, I can hardly believe that they can seriously quibble with the amendment. An explicit assurance on the matter is desperately needed.<br><br>
I realise that the Labour party's current machismo leads to a lack of respect for Parliament and a lack of willingness to listen to the views of others. That has been reflected in the Government's abuse of their own consultation procedures with regard to the stakeholder pension concept, in their rejection of all of the Opposition amendments to the Bill and in their rejection of the pleas and advice of charities in relation to the harsh measures proposed for the disabled. If they cannot be big enough to accept an Opposition amendment as an improvement to their Bill, I hope that they will provide a firm equivalent assurance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gainsborough)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend remind me how many of his amendments Ministers have accepted?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 988</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is an easy number to count—zero. I am not investing any personal ego; Ministers have not accepted amendments from any Opposition Member. No Labour Member has suggested any amendments, although the hon. Member for High Peak (Mr. Levitt)—no doubt as a reward for some of his excessively flattering and unctuous remarks about the Minister of State—was allowed to put his name to the Minister of State's own amendment. Furthermore, not a single amelioration or relief proposed by charities and voluntary bodies—many of which have put a great deal of work into advising on the Committee's proceedings and have contributed thousands of man hours and man and woman years on behalf of the disabled—has been accepted. Those organisations have sometimes been much more conciliatory than Opposition Members, who have rightly decided to object to the whole principle of the means-testing and reduction of the scale of support for the disabled, which are the essential principles of the Government's proposals from clause 51 onwards.<br><br>
The Government have not listened to anybody. As we have observed in every context in the House, they think that their vast majority—which is also docile, as the Committee has shown—allows them to get away with anything. It is extremely bad, in a democracy, for a Government to adopt a dismissive and contemptuous approach to the views and suggestions of Opposition Members and of those outside the House who represent or work with the people who are directly affected by such pernicious measures. All hon. Members represent citizens of this country—I hope that the Labour party recognises that the Conservative party represents many millions of fellow citizens.<br><br>
The answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) is not a thing, not a sausage. During our proceedings, not a single word in the Bill has been altered as a result of representations from any quarter. That is a worrying characteristic of the way in which the country is governed by this autocratic, new Labour Government. There are times when we all say, "I wonder why we're here—I wonder why we bother."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. There are certainly moments when I wonder that, particularly when the hon. Gentleman embarks on one of his circular arguments. He has been round this argument twice and he is half way round it again. Will he please return to the substance of the amendment?</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In going round, as you put it, Mr. McWilliam, I am trying to illustrate the substance and purpose of the Government's proposals from all available angles. To identify a mountain correctly and understand its characteristics, one must view it from different sides. The characteristics and qualities of the Government's proposals are pretty unpleasant—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The trouble is that we are dealing with a molehill. The amendment makes its own argument, which is narrow and obvious, and I wish that the hon. Gentleman would return to it.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I1013">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 989</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that you feel that the amendment makes its own argument, Mr. McWilliam.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Are not the speeches of my hon. Friend, whom I must defend, like Cézanne's 80 paintings of Mont St. Victoire, each of which is different, beautiful, relevant, and adds to the totality of our knowledge?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Hyperbole is always to be denigrated in Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Hugh Bayley)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. Would not you agree that the speeches of the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford are more like the works of Cristo, which are wrapped in paper and string so that no one can see them?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have seen one of Cristo's paintings, and am tempted to break the rules of chairmanship by suggesting that anyone who wears ties like the Under-Secretary's should not, as it were, throw stones in glass houses.—[<i>Laughter.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. McWilliam. My own tie is not the most sober that I possess, but it is tasteful compared to the Under-Secretary's.<br><br>
Although the comparison between Cézanne and me was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough, it was nevertheless a little far-fetched. Of course, Cézanne had a great flair for extracting the essentials from a landscape. I hope that, in analysing the Bill, the Conservative party has shown a similar flair for essentials. However, I would not like my hon. Friend to say about me the sort of things that the hon. Member for High Peak says about the Minister of State. I am sorry to say that I am not in a position to offer my hon. Friend the opportunity to be a cosignatory to a Government amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You will be in two years' time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In two years' time we shall introduce legislation that will be much more attractive than the Government's.<br><br>
I am glad that you feel, Mr. McWilliam, that the amendment makes its own argument, and I hope that Government Committee members feel the same. The Government must give a cast-iron assurance that housing benefit regulations will in no case be used to deprive a carer of the right to his or her own room in a disabled household. We all know of carers who have shown deeply touching devotion to disabled persons over many years. A horrible day's work would be done if we were to put such people at risk and cause them unnecessary and gratuitous anxiety.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can start by giving the hon. Gentleman exactly the assurance that he wants. In no circumstances will the clause be used to deprive disabled people of the space that they need and in no circumstances will it be used, or could it be used, to deprive carers of the space that they need.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 990</span>
The hon. Gentleman made great play of the fact that the Government have not accepted any of the Oppositions amendments, at least so far in the Committee's proceedings. I have not been a Member of the House for as long as the hon. Gentleman, but I sat on many Standing Committees during my five years in opposition, and on no occassion did the Conservative Government agree to an Oppostion amendment. Such things do not happen. Sometimes when good arguments have been put forward, Government Ministers have said that they will reflect on them and perhaps bring forward proposals at a later stage, but I recall no occasion during the previous Parliament on which the Government accepted an Opposition amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary knows that the formula that he has just used is the one that is normally used. It was used many times during debates in Committees on which I sat as a Government Back Bencher. In most cases, both Government and Opposition agree that it is sensible to use parliamentary draftsmen to produce the text of legislation. Therefore, the formula used by the Under-Secretary is the one that I would expect him to use were he to accept the principel of the amendment. However, as he well knows, that formula has not been used in this Committee's proceedings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It appears that we agree, at least, on the procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eric Pickles <span class='memberconstituency'>(Brentwood and Ongar)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to the Under-Secretary for giving way. I must say that his tie is particularly fetching.<br><br>
I should point out that the Government accepted some of the Opposition's amendments just a few weeks ago, during proceedings on the Tax Credits Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There undoubtedly were occasions during the previous Parliament when the approach mentioned by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford was taken, whereby the Government were provoked by the Opposition into agreeing to draft amendments. Obviously my arguments were not sufficiently persuasive to convince the then Government, but, clearly, those of other hon. Members must have been better, as must have been the case during the Tax Credits Bill.<br><br>
On ties, the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar and I might not agree on many things, but clearly we share similar taste in ties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I believe that, in that respect, the Under-Secretary has the unanimous consent of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To return to the matter under debate, the Government have taken great care to consult the voluntary bodies that represent disabled people. We did so by establishing the disability benefits forum in June last year. We consulted extensively before we published our Green Paper, and the Green Paper reflected that consultation. We have made further amendments to our proposals since the publication of the Green Paper, such as the extension, in certain
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I1014">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 991</span>
circumstances, of the improvement in benefits to younger people under 25 who have never had the opportunity to work. That came about as a result of consultation with the voluntary sector. We continue to consult voluntary bodies on the implementation of these provisions and on practical matters relating to the administration of benefits. Those organisations play an extremely important part in bringing their insight to Government policies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned an organisation, the disability benefits forum, of which I have never heard. There is an organisation called the Disability Benefits Consortium, which has brought together RADAR, the Disability Alliance, the Royal National Institute for Deaf People, the Royal National Institute for the Blind, Mencap, Age Concern and the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux. Those organisations have done a lot of work on the Bill and the Under-Secretary has seen many representations made to the Committee. Not one of the many representations that were made to Committee members has resulted in a modification of the Bill, by Opposition amendment or otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The disability benefits forum was set up by my Department—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The consortium?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, the forum. The hon. Gentleman will be aware from our debates that in June last year the Department of Social Security set up the forum with representatives from disability bodies, including both co-chairs of the disability benefits forum and members of a wide range of voluntary bodies who have been involved in a series of meetings to advise the Government. Many of our ideas were reflected in the Green Paper and the Bill.<br><br>
I would be the first to acknowledge that there are points of difference. That is what we have been discussing in Committee. As is so often the case, voluntary bodies seek the help of Opposition Members of Parliament to propose changes and to obtain debate on those changes. The disability benefits forum provided very full briefings to Committee members and asked for a number of things. It wanted an assurance that the £50 disregard in relation to pensions paid to people in receipt of incapacity benefit would be kept under review. Having considered that, the Government decided to do so and a statement to that effect was made on Second Reading. We introduced an amendment to extend the group of people who are passported off severe disablement allowance and on to incapacity benefit to include those between 20 and 25 who are in higher education or vocational training. That was done because we listened to the arguments. My hon. Friend the Member for High Peak took a particular interest in that issue, as did other hon. Members. The voluntary bodies made the argument and convinced the Government.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 992</span>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies) said that his party wanted to preserve the status quo on incapacity benefit. He also said that it was not his party's policy significantly to increase social security spending. If both statements are true, it is clear that his party's policy must be to oppose our proposed extension of benefits—for example, the extension of DLA to children aged three and four and the creation of the disability income guarantee which will raise the income of the poorest and most severely disabled people on income support—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are going incredibly wide of this narrow amendment. It would benefit the Committee if the Under-Secretary would speak to the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I felt that the Committee deserved a reply to the full breadth of the hon. Gentleman's speech, but I shall return to the narrow focus of the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is going to speak to the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, Mr. McWilliam, and certainly on the Under-Secretary's comments on the amendment—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I called the Under-Secretary to order for not commenting on the amendment. I hope that the hon. Gentleman does not propose to continue that argument because I shall ask him to resume his seat immediately.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendment is to protect disabled people by ensuring that their needs are taken into account in the under-occupation scheme. I understand the concern of the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford and I hope that I can assure him and other Committee members that the amendment is unnecessary.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
We recognise that some disabled people need extra space for a carer or for other reasons. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I hope that I have the attention of the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford. As it is drafted, the clause already allows people to gain from the scheme even when they require additional space, provided that their new accommodation is smaller than their old accommodation. The relevant provisions are found in subsection 2(b), which states that people can benefit from the scheme if their new property is
<br><blockquote><p>"under-occupied to a lesser extent than the claimant's former dwelling".</p></blockquote>
and in subsection 3(a), which states that regulations will be used to make the relevant provisions.<br><br>
I make it absolutely clear that the scheme will be entirely voluntary. There will be no compulsion on anyone to move home. Individuals will decide whether they want to take part in the scheme and on the size of the property that they need. The decision to move will be theirs alone.<br><br>

The clause already makes explicit provision for the guarantees that the hon. Gentleman seeks, and I hope that he will withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We were not satisfied with the drafting of the clause. As you rightly said, Mr. McWilliam, much of what the Under-Secretary said was not strictly relevant, but at the beginning of his response he gave the clear assurance that we wanted. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 240, in page 57, line 46, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>'(any reduction made by virtue of subsection (4) being disregarded for the purposes of this subsection).'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may consider Government amendments Nos. 241, 261 and 262.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These are technical amendments that will not change the intent of the clause.<br><br>
I shall begin with amendment No. 240. Payments to a person under the proposed housing benefit under-occupation scheme may be reduced by any rent arrears owed or by any overpaid amount of housing benefit. The new wording will ensure that local authorities are reimbursed for the amount payable to the claimant before deductions for rent arrears or overpayments are made. Without the amendments, local authorities would have been out of pocket when applying the regulations to someone with rent arrears or with overpayments.<br><br>
Amendment No. 241 will ensure that the proposed scheme may, as intended, be applied to housing association accommodation in Scotland. The earlier wording was narrowly drafted and would have allowed the scheme to be applied only to that type of accommodation in England and Wales.<br><br>
Amendment No. 262, which will amend schedule 9, modifies the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 to bring the under-occupation scheme into line with the tax treatment of housing benefit generally. It will ensure that payments made under the housing benefit under-occupation scheme that is proposed by the clause will be paid tax-free, like all other payments of housing benefit.<br><br>
Because tax law applies to the whole of the United Kingdom, the amendment also relates to Northern Ireland. That means that any payments that are made under a corresponding under-occupation scheme there would also be tax-exempt. Of course, the decision to run such a scheme would rest with the Northern Ireland Assembly.<br><br>
Finally, in order to include amendment No. 262 in schedule 9, a small change needs to be made to clause 69. Amendment No. 261 will achieve that.<br><br>
I hope that the Committee will support the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Something that the Under-Secretary said about amendment No. 240 has brought me to my feet. It relates to rent arrears. As I understand the clause, there is not only a question of a tenant
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 994</span>
exercising a right; there must also be agreement by the local authority to decide whether to make the necessary payments. I support the amendment in principle, and its provision would be sensible in the circumstances outlined, but it would be unfortunate if the Minister was implying that a tenant may exercise that right, yet a local authority may have no discretion as to whether to accept it.<br><br>
I should like to make a couple of points that may save time in the clause stand part debate. The Conservative party supports this measure. It is sensible, but it must be used carefully, because there is a fine line between people who have lived in a home for a considerable amount of time—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is plenty of time for a clause stand part debate, and I have no intention of denying the Committee such a debate. I therefore invite the hon. Gentleman to save such comments until that time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise. I said that I had a couple of things to say, which might save us time, and I mistook your nod for agreement, Mr. McWilliam.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I misheard the hon. Gentleman. I thought that he said that he had a couple of other things to say on a clause stand part debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall restrict myself to speaking to the amendments.<br><br>
I seek reassurance from the Minister with regard to the discretionary powers of local authorities. I understand that no local authority will be compelled to participate in the scheme, and that it is to be piloted in two or three places, but the regulations will apply nationally. If the Minister will respond to those questions, we can move on to the clause stand part debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar understands the purpose of the clause. No local authority will be compelled to operate a scheme under the clause. He rightly says that the Government intend to pilot the new power in three areas, and we shall learn from the experience of the pilot studies.<br><br>
However, I must make it clear to the Committee that the local authority will have to agree to a tenancy transfer; the tenant will not be able to pick and choose a property and overrule the housing policy of the local authority. We hope that the clause, as amended, will achieve the aim of freeing up larger units in the areas where they are needed.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Rendel <span class='memberconstituency'>(Newbury)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I intended to raise two questions in the clause stand part debate, but one has already been satisfactorily answered, although I am not sure what relevance it had to the amendment that was being discussed. Perhaps the Minister got away with that before you caught him out, Mr. McWilliam. That was the question of whether the scheme will remain voluntary. The Minister has put it on record that it will remain so, and I am delighted with that assurance.<br><br>
Will any sums paid under the scheme be offset against means-tested benefits? If the scheme is to provide an incentive, it is important that payments are not offset against any means-tested benefits, otherwise the incentive will be much reduced. The explanatory notes hint that that is the Government's intention, but they are not clear and I hope that the Under-Secretary will take the opportunity to make it absolutely clear that no means-tested benefits will be reduced by payment under the scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Under-Secretary has already had an indication that I want to speak about means-tested benefits and the nature of the incentive.<br><br>
The Conservative Opposition support this sensible measure and it is as well to introduce a pilot scheme because lessons will be learned from that. It is frustrating for local authorities that need to house families requiring a large number of bedrooms when such properties are occupied by single people. There is a fine line to be drawn because people may have lived in a property for many years, perhaps even for two or three generations and, if it is the family home, it may be a wrench to leave it. I was pleased that the Under-Secretary said that the scheme will remain voluntary, but the Opposition are keen to ensure that there is no drift and that it is firmly stated that it will be voluntary, so that people are not pressured into giving up their homes.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel) referred to the measure being an inducement. The inducement must be considerable to persuade people to move home. It is an expensive process and they will want their incomes to increase. It will be false economy if the inducement is offset against means-tested benefits. I hope that the measure will go some way towards releasing larger council and housing association properties, particularly in metropolitan authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The underlying principle of the clause is supported by both sides of the Committee. At present, the benefits system provides little incentive to people living in public rented housing to make efficient use of the housing stock. The clause will remedy that deficiency by providing an incentive for people to move to smaller accommodation when that is their wish and it is appropriate to their needs.<br><br>
Two issues were raised and I can give a clear assurance that sums of money paid out under the scheme will not be offset against means-tested benefit. The payments will be treated as neither income nor capital in the administration of other means-tested benefits for reasons which the hon. Member for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 996</span>
Newbury clearly explained. If they were taken into account, there would be little incentive and the scheme would be unlikely to work.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar referred to pressure or compulsion. I can give a categorical assurance that nobody will be put under pressure to give up his or her home. We understand that a home and its memories form an extremely important part of a person's sense of identity, security and community. The scheme will work on a voluntary basis only. It will apply where people wish to move from homes that are too large to available homes in which they would be happier. Where a public sector tenant who is in receipt of benefits moves into an available home that is smaller than that currently occupied, there will be a financial benefit. However, such a tenant will certainly not be compelled to move.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may discuss the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 336, in clause 73, page 62, line 37, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'except that section 66 shall not come into force until the Secretary of State is satisfied that there are sufficient safeguards within the Child Support Agency to protect the confidential nature of the information declared.'.</p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 337, in clause 73, page 63, line 10, leave out '65 to 68' and insert '65, 67 and 68'.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are probing amendments. They relate to confidentiality and the trust that people place in the Inland Revenue.<br><br>
Meeting someone at, say, a cocktail party who works for the Inland Revenue is perhaps as welcome as meeting a mortician. However, although one's own tax burden is never welcomed, people place a degree of trust in the Inland Revenue. I believe that it is unheard of for an individual's tax returns to become a matter of public debate, or for the Revenue to leak information to the tabloid press or others. Indeed, the Revenue has handled individuals' tax records in a professional manner for many decades. When one gives information to the Revenue, one understands that it will remain a matter for the Revenue and the taxpayer and will not be passed to other, inquisitive departments or to Ministers.<br><br>
Nevertheless Committee members who run advice bureaux and surgeries will know of husbands on supposedly low incomes who are the subject of claims for maintenance through the Child Support Agency but who, according to their estranged wives, are driving round in Porsches, leading exciting lives and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I1017">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 997</span>
enjoying a standard of living well above what they declared to the Child Support Agency. Not unnaturally, the Government want to be able to ascertain the information that such people give to the Inland Revenue, which would discourage them from deceiving the Revenue. As some jockeys and people in the entertainment industry will testify, the Revenue pursues those who give false information with thoroughness.<br><br>
Sadly, the Child Support Agency does not enjoy the degree of public trust that the Revenue enjoys. You will note, Mr. McWilliam, that I am putting the matter in very polite terms. The Child Support Agency has a reputation for not getting things right. In the final year of the previous Conservative Administration, we were alarmed to discover that only 59 per cent. of claims were accurately dealt with, which is shocking. We were even more alarmed to discover that, in the first year of the new Labour Government, 62 per cent. of claims were not accurately dealt with. So it seems that the competency of the Child Support Agency is on a downward shift. People are concerned, not unnaturally, that once information is disclosed by the Inland Revenue, the same professionalism and rigour will not be applied to guarding information. It is not surprising that there is some alarm in the press about that, and I want to read out a couple of headlines to give the Committee an idea. One headline in the <i>Daily Mail</i> reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"Tax secrets will be revealed in Drive to Make Runaway fathers Pay Maintenance."</p></blockquote>
Another in the <i>Daily Express</i> reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"Parent's Tax Files to be Opened for CSA Snoops."</p></blockquote>
<i>The Scotsman</i> is concerned about civil liberties abuse.<br><br>
It is not so much the contents of those headlines that is important as the way in which they are put across because they speak for the public. No one would describe the Inland Revenue as snoops, but people are concerned that the CSA does not have sufficient control to ensure that—as is clearly stated in the Bill and even more clearly stated in the explanatory notes—this provision is used as an exception when things have gone wrong. Therefore, I am asking the Minister to say, for the record, that this provision will be used only in exceptional circumstances and that an exhaustive procedure must be followed before tax files are opened.<br><br>
To move on to my second point, a couple of Thursdays ago, we discussed access to information, and I gave notice that I wished to return to the subject of files being kept electronically and data protection. I want to know how available files will be to individual claimants under data protection legislation because the way in which information about individuals is kept is rapidly changing and those changes are likely to accelerate in the next few years. Several assurances were given by Ministers that would properly apply to information kept in manilla files in a filing cabinet but which would not apply to files kept electronically because of the data protection Acts. I would appreciate some elucidation on that matter.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 998</span>
In conclusion, my principal concern is to get a clear statement from the Minister about the procedures that would have to be exhausted before a person's tax records could be disclosed to the CSA. What protections are there within the CSA to ensure that significant walls are built around that information, so that it could not be disclosed to other departments or to parties involved in the case? I look forward to receiving those assurances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Joan Humble <span class='memberconstituency'>(Blackpool, North and Fleetwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar praised the Inland Revenue's staff. I worked for it many years ago, and I am glad that he has faith in its employees.<br><br>
I should respond to his statement that procedures have to be exhausted before the clause's power to get information from the Inland Revenue will come into effect. We have all come across cases in our surgeries in which the parent with care had great difficulty obtaining support, through the Child Support Agency, from the absent parent—often the father—who was self-employed, because the CSA could not get hold of information about his earnings. My concern, which is different from that of the hon. Gentleman is that even with the clause's provisions, an inordinate length of time may pass before information is extracted from the individual who is refusing to give it.<br><br>
We need to achieve a balance. On the one hand, the absent parent should have sufficient time to give the necessary information to the CSA—such proposals might reflect the way in which people who are currently in employment give that information—but, on the other hand, we need to recognise that many children do not receive the support that they should receive from the absent parent. The needs of children must come first, but we should also give the parent with care the time to provide the information.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not know that the hon. Lady had worked for the Inland Revenue. Her professionalism shines through. Given the Minister's reaction I did not labour the point about procedures. The hon. Lady talked about a balance, but that is not right. The position needs to be skewed in favour of non-disclosure, for one reason. There is enormous trust in the Inland Revenue, and it is in the Government's and the House's, interest to do nothing to dilute that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Humble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that anyone would dispute that there is such trust in the Inland Revenue, or that we should do nothing to upset it. People are confident about giving information to the Revenue, and they know that that information will be disclosed only in exceptional circumstances.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman should consider the clause in the context of the proposed reform of the CSA. I welcome many of the proposals in the Government's Green Paper on the CSA, and I look forward to the legislation that will reform it and ensure that it is properly run. We all know about the CSA's disasters. I could write a book about them—I have heard just about everything that could go wrong in the CSA. The clause is one small part of the need to resolve the problem.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 999</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I urge the hon. Lady to do so. If her book is as good as her speeches, it will be a best seller.<br><br>
I said that amendment No. 336 was a probing amendment, but, given the hon Lady's strong case, perhaps I should press it to a Division. Perhaps we should not take the proposed steps until the CSA has been reformed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Humble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to delay our debate on the clause to the extent that I have done. I wanted to make a brief intervention. We all agree that the Revenue's dealings with taxpayers must involve confidentiality. An assurance must be given that robust procedures will be in place to protect the integrity of the Inland Revenue and its staff and their dealings with other agencies. I am sure that the Minister will provide such assurances. Equally, we must remember that the clause is designed to help those children who have not been receiving the support from absent parents that they should have been receiving. If the clause can go some way towards helping those absent parents who are derelicting their duty to their children, it is welcome. I look forward to the Under-Secretary's comments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government firmly believe that all children have a right to the emotional and financial support of both parents. My hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble) is absolutely right to say that the needs of the childen must come first. I do not think that any Committee Member would dissent from that.</span></p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman believes—as we all do—that children have a right to the financial and emotional support of their parents. Does he also believe that parents should have an automatic right—unless there is a clear reason why they should not, such as a history of assault—to have access to their children? It is scandalous that many parents who love their children and who pay for their support, through the CSA or otherwise, are denied access to their children.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am cautious about being drawn further into the subject of the court, although the hon. Gentleman raises an important point. In some ways, the manner in which he posed the question explains why an absolutely categorical answer cannot be given. There are cases in which the courts should provide access but do not—all Committee members will have dealt with such cases in their constituencies. The Government cannot give an assurance that access should be provided in all cases, for exactly the reason identified by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford. Where there has been abuse, it would not be appropriate to grant access. The courts must decide on access issues with reference to the circumstances of each particular case.<br><br>
The Government recognise that the vast majority of self-employed, non-resident parents want to support their children. We acknowledge their co-operation in working out their maintenance liability. It is unjust
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1000</span>
that a small minority of non-resident parents can get away without co-operating with the CSA simply because they are self-employed. We cannot allow the few who are irresponsible to continue to frustrate the child support process. As hon. Members will know, obtaining maintenance from self-employed, nonresident parents who wish to evade their responsibilities can cause enormous problems for the agency. That is often because such non-resident parents refuse to supply the information necessary for the agency to make a full maintenance assessment. While the CSA already has the power to obtain information about employed non-resident parents directly from their employer, that is clearly not possible in the case of self-employed parents.<br><br>
I can assure the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar that the clause will be used as a last resort, after all attempts to get information from other sources have failed, to enable the CSA to check tax records in the interests of the children.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it not the case that the Inland Revenue has expressed considerable concern about the proposal to reduce the protection of confidentiality?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not aware that they have. If I receive further advice during my speech, I shall return to the point.<br><br>
As well as it being vital to assure the public that information provided to the Inland Revenue will be treated in absolute confidence, it is necessary and in the public interest to ensure that children whose parents, sadly, are separated, receive emotional and financial support from both parents. That is why the clause is in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Under-Secretary will say a little more about confidentiality, specifically within the CSA, but I have a question on last resort. He has given the Committee an assurance but he and I, and the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood, might interpret last resort differently. When regulations are drafted, will guidance be given to CSA officials on the hurdles to be passed before last resort arrives? Will they have to make inquiries of other agencies and what will happen if the person from whom they are seeking information makes a disclosure that is thought to be less than absolute?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 66 builds on the regulations approved by the House last month which, from October, will allow self-employed people to provide the figures that are used for self assessment of their earnings for tax purposes to the CSA for use in calculating child maintenance. If someone willlingly provides that information to the agency, there will be no need to invoke the clause. It is for use only when all other channels of inquiry have failed to provide the information that is required under the law to calculate the absent parent's maintenance responsibility for his or her children.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I1019">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1001</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One of the most pernicious aspects of the CSA is its attempt to extract information about the financial affairs of new spouses or co-habitees who have no relationship with the children concerned. Will he assure the Committee that the Inland Revenue will not be asked for information, or enabled under the clause to divulge information, about the co-habitee or subsequent spouse of an absent parent who has no relationship to the children concerned?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This debate is becoming disjointed through my deficiency and that issue is another on which I want to take further advice. Perhaps I can reply at slightly greater length to the point raised earlier by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford about the concerns that he said the Inland Revenue had expressed. The Revenue is anxious to preserve the confidentiality of taxpayers' records, but it accepts and supports the provision to allow disclosure as a last resort in the interests of children. The hon. Gentleman referred to new spouses and co-habitees. The clause does not allow the Inland Revenue to disclose information about anyone other than the self-employed, non-resident parent in question.<br><br>
The amendments seek a prior guarantee that the power being conferred on the Inland Revenue will not be abused. I hope that I can satisfy Opposition Members that the amendments are unnecessary for three reasons.<br><br>
First, in the course of its daily business, the CSA handles information that is substantially more personal and sensitive than the financial information to which the clause relates. Its staff are required to handle information with the utmost care. Section 50 of the Child Support Act 1991 makes it a criminal offence for any CSA employee to disclose without lawful authority information that has been acquired in the course of their employment. That offence is punishable by up to two years' imprisonment.<br><br>
The Government are satisfied that the agency's rules of disclosure on personal information are more than adequate. The provisions introduced by clause 66 will be subject to those stringent rules.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will there be no special arrangements regarding information disclosed by the Inland Revenue, once it arrives at the CSA? It is my experience of the CSA, and that of the general public, that the present safeguards are not adequate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am as concerned as the hon. Gentleman that any information disclosed should be properly safeguarded, because any failure so to do would undermine the credibility of the CSA and provide a serious problem for the Revenue. Clearly, it is in our interests that that should not happen.<br><br>
The provision under section 50 of the Child Support Act 1991—which makes it a criminal offence for an employee of the CSA to disclose, without lawful authority, information obtained as a result of their work—has been applied, although in only one case since the CSA was created. There is, therefore, a tried and tested means of taking legal action against the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1002</span>
CSA employee who abuses the trust that they enjoy in that position. It has only been necessary to use it on one occasion and I hope that it will never be necessary to use it again, but the legal safeguard already exists in the 1991 Act.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar also sought an assurance that an adequate wall would be built round the information, to ensure that only information directly relevant to the calculation of the claim in question was supplied by the Revenue to the CSA. To provide further protection, subsection (4) sets clearly defined limits on the disclosure of the information obtained. The only purpose for which information can be passed on to anyone other than the Secretary of State or his representative is for use in civil or criminal proceedings in connection with the operation of the 1991 Act. That provision will be used only as a last resort, when all other attempts to discover the information from the non-resident parent have failed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the matter of last resorts, the Minister must be aware that, initially, the CSA announced that earnings attachment orders would be used only as a last resort. However, they are now almost automatic. The CSA waits eagerly for a payment to be one day late, after which an earnings attachment order is automatically enforced. Does the Minister therefore realise that we listen with scepticism to assurances about last resorts that come from the CSA, or that are made on its behalf?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is right for hon. Members on both sides of the Committee, but especially those on the Opposition Benches, to approach with scepticism all occasions on which the Government seek to take greater powers. It is the role of Parliament to scrutinise the Government's actions.<br><br>
I do not agree with the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford that there has been an abuse of the power to apply for an earnings attachment order. In my experience, such orders are sought only when all other efforts have been made to reach agreement with and secure payment from the absent parent. In a number of cases in my constituency, I sought to help the parent with care—usually, that parent is a woman—to obtain maintenance due to her and urged the agency to seek an attachment order. That is the only way in which the children will get the income that they need to grow up with dignity.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
Having said that, I can reassure the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford that every effort will be made to obtain information in the normal way by sending out an inquiry form to absent self-employed parents. The new provision, which was agreed by regulations last month, will allow the person concerned voluntarily to submit a tax return to the CSA. The power contained in the order will be used only when both of those procedures have been adopted.<br><br>
In the light of that explanation, I hope that the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford will feel inclined to withdraw the amendments.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary has given a full account of the matter. He said that the questions that arose were, by their nature, disjointed. It is, perhaps, for that reason that he failed to answer my question, for which I provided a fortnight's notice, on the Data Protection Act 1998. I should be grateful if he would answer it now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I was seeking advice on other matters at the time that the hon. Gentleman asked the question. Will he therefore repeat it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I readily understand that not all questions are necessarily heard in Committee and I am happy to repeat it. The Under-Secretary will recall our earlier discussion on the disclosure of information with regard to jobseeker's allowance. It was during that discussion that I asked my question which, as I said, relates to clause 66.<br><br>
The way in which the Government store information will undoubtedly change considerably. Where information is stored electronically, the Data Protection Act comes into play. My question principally concerned the duty of authorities to disclose all information kept on file. I asked how the Government intend to deal with that sensitive issue in respect of the electronic storage of such information, as opposed to its storage in manila files. Although the Government are moving rapidly towards electronic storage, much information continues to be stored in paper files. However, that will change—more quickly than most Committee members realise. How will the 1998 Act be applied with regard to this sensitive issue?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, the provisions in the 1998 Act apply to the supply of electronic data. The safeguards in the clause will apply to electronic data in the same way that they apply to information stored on paper. I do not know whether I am being a bit thick—if I am, I apologise to the Committee. If I have not covered any other points that the hon. Gentleman made, I invite him to write to me. I shall do my best to respond to him before the Bill returns to the Floor of the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful. However, it is not right to say that information that is stored electronically involves the same safeguards as those that apply to information that is stored on paper. The Data Protection Act 1998 provides the reasons for the difference. How will the Government deal with that situation? If the Under-Secretary wants to write to me about that, that would be fine—I do not expect him to be an expert on everything. However, it is in the interest of the House and the Government for the Under-Secretary and his officials to resolve the problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can advise the hon. Gentleman that the Data Protection Act 1998 contains specific exemption from its provisions when disclosure is made in accordance with a specific legislative requirement.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1004</span>
The clause's provisions will constitute such a legislative requirement and they will assist with the disclosure of information.</span></p>

This technical amendment to subsection (6) reflects the fact that as of 1 April, management and control of the National Insurance Fund was transferred from the Secretary of State for Social Security to the Inland Revenue by the Social Security Contributions (Transfer of Functions, etc.) Act 1999. It will not affect the way in which the clause will operate in any other respect and I hope that the Committee will agree to it.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may consider Government amendments Nos. 282 to 284.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These are minor technical amendments. Subsection (7) will permit regulations that will be made under the Bill to make different provision for different areas. The power will apply to certain benefits that are listed in subsection (7). Currently, those benefits are housing benefit, council tax benefit, jobseeker's allowance, income support, family credit and disability working allowance.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 281 and 282 will remove some of the benefits from that list. Family credit and disability working allowance will be removed because they will be replaced by the new working families tax credit and the disabled persons tax credit. Income support will be removed because we do not intend to make any regulations under the Bill, as opposed to other Acts, that relate to that benefit. We have also concluded that the jobseeker's allowance can be removed from the list because we need the power to make different provisions in different areas for JSA only in relation to the special employment schemes that will be introduced by clause 49. Amendment No. 283 will provide the more limited power that we require by ensuring that regulations that are made under clause 49 can make different provisions for different areas.<br><br>
Amendment No. 284 will remove paragraph 26(3) from schedule 8. That paragraph would have enabled powers in the Jobseekers Act 1995 to make different jobseeker's allowance provisions for different areas.

That power is not needed, except in employment zones. If the amendments are agreed to, the clause will provide all of the powers that we need to implement employment zones. Paragraph 26(3) should therefore be removed from the schedule.<br><br>
I commend the amendments to the Committee.</span></p>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 68(2) provides for the making of regulations to be subject to the negative resolution procedure. Clearly, Opposition Members would prefer the affirmative procedure to be used. The Committee has had two substantial debates on that matter, so we will not table an amendment on it. However, it is about time that the House dealt with that important question. The Modernisation Committee came up with the more sensible idea of super-affirmative resolutions, which I hope will be introduced at some stage.</span></p>

CERTAIN OVERPAYMENTS OF BENEFIT NOT TO BE RECOVERABLE</div> <!-- title -->
<p>'.—(1) An overpayment to which this section applies shall not be recoverable from the payee, whether by the Secretary of State or a local authority, under any provision made by or under Part III of the Administration Act (overpayments and adjustments of benefit).</p>
<p>(2) This section applies to an overpayment if—
<ol>
<li>it is in respect of a qualifying benefit;</li>
<li>it is referable to a decision given on a review that there has been an alteration in the relevant person's condition, being a decision to which effect is required to be given as from a date earlier than that on which it was given;</li>
<li>the decision was given before 1st June 1999; and</li>
<li>the overpayment is not excluded by virtue of subsection (6).</li>
</ol></p>
<p>(3) In subsection (2)(b) the reference to a finding on a review that there has been an alteration in the relevant person's condition is a reference to a finding that that person's physical or mental condition either was at that time when the original decision was given, or has subsequently become, different from that on which that decision was based, with the result—
<ol>
<li>that he did not at that time, or (as the case may be) has subsequently ceased to, meet any of the conditions contained in the following provisions of the Contributions and Benefits Act, namely—</li>
<ol>
<li>section 64 (attendance allowance),</li>
<li>section 72(1) or (2) (care component of disability living allowance), and</li>
<li>section 73(1) or (2) (mobility component of that allowance); or</li>
</ol>
<li>that he was at that time, or (as the case may be) has subsequently become, capable of work in accordance with regulations made under section 171C(2) of that Act (the all work test).</li>
</ol></p>
<p>(4) For the purposes of this section "qualifying benefit" means—
<ol>
<li>attendance allowance;</li>
<li>disability living allowance;</li>
<li>any benefit awarded wholly or partly by reason of a person being (or being treated as being)—</li>
<ol>
<li>in receipt of a component (at any rate) of disability living allowance or in receipt of attendance allowance, or</li>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1007</span>
<li>in receipt of any benefit falling within sub-paragraph (i);</li>
</ol>
<li>incapacity benefit or any benefit awarded wholly or partly by reason of a person being (or being treated as being) in receipt of incapacity benefit; or</li>
<li>any other benefit awarded wholly or partly by reason of a person being (or being treated as being)—</li>
<ol>
<li>incapable of work, or</li>
<li>in receipt of any benefit falling within sub-paragraph (i).</li>
</ol></ol></p>
<p>(5) For the purposes of this section—
<ol>
<li>"review" means a review taking place by virtue of section 25(1)(a) or (b) or section 30(2)(a) or (b) of the Administration Act;</li>
<li>"the relevant person", in relation to a review, means the person to whose entitlement to a qualifying benefit or to whose incapacity for work the review related; and</li>
<li>"the original decision", in relation to a review, means the decision as to any such entitlement or incapacity to which the review related.</li>
</ol></p>
<p>(6) An overpayment is excluded by virtue of this subsection if (before or after the passing of this Act)—
<ol>
<li>the payee has agreed to pay a penalty in respect of the overpayment under section 115A of the Administration Act, or</li>
<li>the payee has been convicted of any offence (under section 111A or 112(1) or (1A) of that Act or otherwise) in connection with the overpayment, or</li>
<li>proceedings have been instituted against the payee for such an offence and the proceedings have not been determined or abandoned.</li>
</ol></p>
<p>(7) Nothing in this section applies to an overpayment to the extent that it was recovered from the payee (by any means) before 26th February 1999.</p>
<p>(8) In this section—
<ul>
<li>"benefit" includes any amount included in—</li>
<ol>
<li>the applicable amount in relation to an income-related benefit (as defined by section 135(1) of the Contributions and Benefits Act), or</li>
<li>the applicable amount in relation to a jobseeker's allowance (as defined by section 4(5) of the Jobseekers Act 1995);</li>
</ol>
<li>"income-related benefit" has the meaning given by section 123(1) of the Contributions and Benefits Act;</li>
<li>"overpayment" means an amount of benefit paid in excess of entitlement;</li>
<li>"the payee", in relation to an overpayment, means the person to whom that amount was paid.'.—[<i>Mr. Bayley.</i>]</li></ul></p>
<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider Government amendment No. 334.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A full discussion of the new clause and the issues surrounding it took place on the Floor of the House when the supplementary money resolution was debated two weeks ago.<br><br>
New clause 12 ensures that there is no requirement to recover overpaid benefit from severely disabled people where it would be unreasonable to do so. I commend the clause and the amendment to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is extremely necessary to discuss the new clause, not least because our previous discussion in the Chamber was unsatisfactory. The Minister of State had not been briefed on his own new clause and did not know the answers to some crucial
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1008</span>
questions about it. He did not even want to introduce his new clause or money resolution in the Chamber, and he has now handed it over to his poor, long-suffering deputy, who will have to defend the Government's proposal.<br><br>
The confusion and uncertainties that already exist in the clause—which we must explore fully before deciding whether to allow it through—have been exacerbated by the Under-Secretary's last three sentences, which he delivered in a perfunctory fashion. He referred to reclaiming moneys from excess payments of benefit from the severely disabled, which is not the same as the disabled. "Severely disabled" has a precise meaning throughout benefit legislation and under the all-work test severely disabled people must be judged to be more than 80 per cent. disabled. Did the Under-Secretary mean what he said, or was it a slip of the tongue? Does the new clause apply only to overpayments to the severely disabled or to anyone who is entitled to any of the disability and invalidity related benefits listed?</span></p>
<p>[KALI MOUNTFORD <i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
<p>The question is important and made necessary by the Under-Secretary's brief introduction. It is quite something when a Government try to introduce legislation by subterfuge and the Minister does not even rise to defend a new clause when it is called because he is so unproud of what he is proposing. When he eventually rises to his feet, he speaks to it in only two or three sentences and creates even more confusion.</p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was staggered by the Under-Secretary's introduction. Some important questions were asked—for example, how much money has been recovered by the agency? No answers were given and the Under-Secretary tried to defend the new clause in two sentences. My hon. Friend must pursue the matter and demand answers to our questions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough. The Government came up with a figure of £15 million after being asked at various times about the financial consequences of the Bill. When the Under-Secretary referred to the £15 million, he did not know whether it was the amount currently outstanding, the total amount that has been reclaimed since 1 February, the total amount outstanding on 1 February and so on. We need some answers.<br><br>
I want to ask some fundamental questions arising from the new clause. It appears to be valid only until 1 June 1999, so what will happen after that? When the House discussed the money resolution, I said that presumably the Government intend to provide that after 1 June the power not to reclaim overpayments will be provided in regulations, but that until 1 June it is necessary to have that power in statute. What will happen if Parliament denies the Government that power? Will there still be a basis for regulations to provide a regime after 1 June to ensure that disabled people are not required to repay sums overpaid before a review took place but after a significant improvement
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I1023">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1009</span>
was deemed to have taken place in the claimant's condition? Will the power to make regulations be available after 1 June if the new clause is not accepted? If the answer is yes and statutory powers exist to allow those regulations to be made to cover the period after 1 June 1999, why are those powers not being used now? Why burden the Committee and Parliament with the new clause? Why not use the regulatory power? If the answer is no, are the Government not making a public confession of astonishing arrogance and assuming that Parliament will approve the new clause? I hope that Parliament does not approve it. In a democracy, it is inappropriate for any Government to make assumptions about whether the legislature will legislate because that is utterly wrong, so we want an answer to that question.<br><br>
To move on to my next question, on Second Reading, the Minister of State, who tried to defend this clause during the debate on the money resolution and who has now retreated and handed over that task to his deputy, seemed to be under the illusion that the new clause applied only to DLA. If he has done his homework since, he might have realised that the new clause does not apply only to DLA, but that is what he thought at the time.<br><br>
That brings me to my fifth question. If the new clause applies only to DLA, what is the point of defining qualifying benefit in subsection (4) as:
<br><blockquote><p>"attendance allowance; disability living allowance; incapacity benefit … or any benefit awarded wholly or partly by reason of a person being"</p></blockquote>
disabled? If the Minister's previous assumption was erroneous, I hope that we shall now hear the clear confirmation that we need to be able to understand the new clause—that the power to relieve the disabled of repaying so-called overpayments of benefits will apply to all disability related benefits. I believe that all Committee members have received a letter from the Minister, signed in his absence by Denise Whitehead. The second paragraph of that letter refers to overpayments of disability benefits. I assume that that is a generic term for all those benefits listed in subsection (4) of new clause 12, and I assume that that is the answer to my fifth question. If not, several other questions will arise.</span></p>
<p>[MR. JOHN MCWILLIAM <i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
<p>If the new clause will apply to all disability related benefits, contrary to the impression given by the Minister on Second Reading, what the devil is meant by "reviews" because the new clause contains many references to reviews? The idea is that no one will be liable to repay benefit for a period during which his or her condition improved before a review. As I said on Second Reading, that is a sensible provision and we support it, but what are the reviews? If the new clause related only to disability living allowance, we would assume that the reviews were those that take place in the context of DLA—reviews undertaken by Benefits Agency staff, partly by postal inquiry and partly by home visit. They are not medical tests or examinations in any sense, but bureaucratic reviews.</p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1010</span>
<p>The problem is that the Government have denounced the effectiveness of such reviews, which form the backbone of the benefit integrity project. The Government have said that it is a thoroughly inefficient and unsatisfactory project, which was invented by the Conservative Government and stupidly implemented by the Labour Government when they came to power, but that the whole thing was a mistake. Are we to continue with that mistake and with the reviews in which the Government do not believe? The Secretary of State has given the House an assurance that that is exactly what he intends to do and that the reviews referred to here will be reviews of the sort that we became familiar with during the benefit integrity project. On 28 January this year, the Secretary of State said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The review process will involve gathering information by postal inquiry and home visits".—[<i>Official Report,</i> 28 January 1999; Vol. 324, c.321.]</p></blockquote>
Therefore, the reviews, which the Government have said are ineffective and unsatisfactory, are to be perpetuated for DLA. Is that system of reviews, which is already condemned by the Government, to be extended to cover the other benefits referred to in the clause: incapacity benefit, severe disability allowance and attendance allowance, which is part of the DLA system as it is DLA for people who are over retirement age? Are the reviews to be extended to any other benefits? Subsection 4(e) states that qualifying benefits include
<br><blockquote><p>"any other benefit awarded wholly or partly by reason of a person being (or being treated as being)—
<ol>
<li>incapable of work, or</li>
<li>in receipt of any benefit falling within the sub-paragraph (i)."</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
Presumably that includes every other disability related benefit. It must include disability working allowance and industrial injury disability benefit. Does it also include the disability supplements to income support? This must be my sixth, seventh or eighth question about those benefits.</p>
<p>We would then face the prospect of reviews—a system in which the Government do not believe—being extended to a totally new range of benefits. Far from cutting down on, or reversing, the benefits integrity project that the Government regard as unsatisfactory, they will greatly expand the evil, as they see it, by extending the reviews to new kinds of benefit, to which they have not hitherto been applied.</p>
<p>What might have been deemed administrative foolishness become completely crazy when one considers that there are already provisions for examinations for incapacity benefit, which we dealt with in clause 50: the new concept of personal capability assessments. There was a memorable moment in the Committee's proceedings when we discovered that the personal capability assessment is nothing other than the old all-work test with a new Labour, politically correct name change.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We have already had those debates. We know how the hon. Gentleman feels about the matter, but I cannot allow him to repeat arguments that he has made before, simply by hanging
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I1024">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1011</span>
them on to subsections 4(a) onwards. The new clause deals only with overpayments that are not to be recoverable. It does not call into question the clauses with which the Committee had already dealt. The hon. Gentleman must come back to the matter before us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Wait a moment, Mr. McWilliam. Whether one can reclaim repayments hangs on the review referred to in subsection (2)(b):
<br><blockquote><p>"it is referable to a decision given on a review that there has been an alteration in the relevant person's condition".</p></blockquote>
We must discover what the term "review" means, We know what it means in the context of DLA.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The clause refers to reviews undertaken according to section 25 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992. I chaired the relevant Committee and I know what the legislation says. If the hon. Gentleman wants to press the Under-Secretary on the form that the reviews will take, that is fine, but trying to discuss all the other benefit changes that the Bill will introduce is out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The review here is of a type that I have already described, involving postal inquiries or home visits by Benefits Agency personnel. The sort of review for which the 1992 Act provides has hitherto been undertaken in the context of the benefit integrity project and the disability living allowance. However, the new clause refers to other disability-related benefits—such as incapacity benefit—to which that review has not hitherto applied. I refer to subsection (4)(d)—</span></p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I understand the hon. Gentleman's difficulty and I am trying to avoid getting involved in the argument. However, the new clause deals only with those reviews that arise from the Social Security Administration Act 1992. The benefits integrity project was a specific project that did not arise from the 1992 Act.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If you can help me, Mr. McWilliam, by saying whether the reviews provided for in the 1992 Act are to be extended to include incapacity benefit and other disability-related benefits to which I referred, you will save the Under-Secretary the trouble of answering my fifth question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I cannot answer that question, but I am glad that the hon. Gentleman asked it clearly because we may now get an answer to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The question is: will the reviews that have hitherto applied only to the disability living allowance—and which the Government have strongly criticised—apply to the other benefits as well? If so, will not the disabled, who are already subject to personal capability assessments, be subject to a double reviewing system? What rhyme or reason is there for such an extraordinary measure? What is more, clause 50 will unfortunately empower the Secretary of State to impose personal capability assessments more or less
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1012</span>
whenever he feels like it. As we said during consideration of that clause, he will be able to come back for more within a week or so of imposing the previous assessment.<br><br>
Will anyone who receives a disability-related benefit to which the new clause refers be subject at any time to a benefits integrity project-type review—whether by post or through a home visit—and a personal capability assessment by a Benefits Agency doctor? If so, that will be a double burden on the disabled and, moreover, the taxpayer. I cannot understand the rhyme or reason for paying doctors large sums of money to carry out complex medical assessments, only to have duplicate assessments carried out by people with no medical background through postal correspondence—a footling idea for those who have already had a capability assessment—or through a home visit. Given that there is a limit to the number of visits that a Benefits Agency representative can make in one day, that too would be an expensive process.<br><br>
Will a double burden be imposed? If not, we must asume that the type of review for which the Social Security Adminstration Act 1992 provides will apply only to DLA and will not be extended to incapacity benefit or other disability-related benefits. In that case, a different review—the personal capability assessment—would be used to decide whether a person's condition has improved and whether and at what level he or she would continue to qualify for benefit. If, as is currently the case, two types of review will apply to different types of benefit, why use the confusing word, "review" in relation to all those benefits? Subsection (2) refers to "review" and defines the circumstances in which a claim for repayment might arise. Subsection (4) lists the other benefits, including incapacity benefit. There is no rhyme or reason to it at all.<br><br>
When we discussed this matter on Second Reading, I asked many of the same questions but received no answers. Indeed, it was clear that the Minister did not know the answers. Now, he has had several weeks in which to do his homework but he does not want to confront me again on the subject himself. He is perfectly entitled to ask his deputy to take over from him and he obviously wants to start with a clean sheet. In the light of his performance in the House the other day, I can understand that.<br><br>
We shall allow the Under-Secretary to start with a clean sheet, but please can we have some answers? These matters are not merely of administrative interest; they are of direct concern to the disabled people who will be subject to the reviews. I am certain that not a single disabled person in this country today knows any more than I do about what the new clause means, whether he or she will be subject to a new sort of administrative or medical review and how the personal capability assessment relates to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause provides that overpayments of benefit will not be recoverable from certain claimants who would otherwise be held responsible for them. It follows a parliamentary answer to the House which I made on 26 February, and in which I said that the Government would be seeking a legislative
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I1025">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1013</span>
solution to this issue through the present Bill. In the light of the contribution made by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford it may be helpful if I explain some of the background in a little more detail.<br><br>
When an award of benefit is revised downwards, it is necessary to determine exactly when the revised award takes effect. If that date is some time in the past, an overpayment of benefit will result. The existing legislation allows for such overpayments to be recovered from someone who, even innocently, misrepresents a material fact that led to the overpayment, or causes the overpayment by failing to report a relevant change in his or her circumstances. This is relatively straightforward where, for example, someone is claiming jobseeker's allowance but fails to report that he or she has started full-time work, or claims income support but fails to declare all of his or her income on the claim form. But when the principles set out in case law are applied to benefits like disability living allowance, where entitlement can depend on judgments of the effects of a person's disabling condition on his or her need for help with personal care or mobility, some patently unfair outcomes can result.<br><br>
When a change in the level of help needed has been gradual, what date should the adjudicator decide upon? If the claimant has an operation that results in improvements, are these instantaneous? Probably not. Common practice in cases where the date of changed entitlement is difficult to determine has been to use the date of the latest information. For example, the date of the examining medical practitioner's report.<br><br>
During the debate on the money resolution, my hon. Friend the Minister of State gave some examples of how these difficulties arise in practice. I do not think that I need to repeat those examples but let me tell the Committee that reviews of entitlement to DLA under the benefit integrity project first brought to our attention that the rules on recovering overpayments worked in a way that was unacceptable and unfair to the severely disabled people who received the benefit. Cases have been identified where, although the current award of benefit is no longer correct and an overpayment has occurred, it is not reasonable to expect the claimant to have known that there was something that he or she should have reported to the Benefits Agency. For example, where the purchase of a piece of equipment has reduced the level of help that the disabled claimant needs from another person, or where major surgery has, over time, resulted in improved independence, albeit with dependence on a strict drug and dietary regime, the resulting overpayments under the benefit integrity project average £5,000 per claimant, and go up to a maximum of £28,000.<br><br>
In addition, a commissioner's decision has identified the fact that a similar problem could potentially arise when the overpayment rules were applied to people who had been entitled to benefit as a result of passing the all-work test. I stress the word "potentially" because no actual overpayments have been identified.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1014</span>
However, we are taking prudent steps to ensure that the same issue does not arise in relation to benefits where entitlement depends on the all-work test or, in future, on personal capability assessments.<br><br>
On 25 February this year, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State issued an accounting officer direction to the chief executive of the Benefits Agency to ensure that no action to recover overpayments was taken in cases involving a disability or incapacity-related review of benefit entitlement.<br><br>
From 1 June, the Government intend to introduce a permanent solution to the problem by regulating under existing powers. The regulations will ensure that in future overpayments will arise only in circumstances which the person concerned knew, or could reasonably have been expected to know, that a fact should have been reported as relevant to his or her benefit claim. That fits in with the current provisions on reviews and with the dates on which they take effect, which are also set out in regulations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is touching on my second question, which he has not yet answered. If the power to make regulations, on which he will rely after 1 June, already exists—he said that he would rely on existing powers—why cannot he solve the problem now by regulation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister of State responded to that point in the Chamber.<br><br>
The problem that arose in relation to benefit integrity project cases was that the point of overpayment occurred in the past, and that no power exists in regulations to make retrospective legislation. In relation to those cases, no powers are available to recover the overpayment. That is why the accounting officer's direction was needed. We can, and we intend to, use regulations in relation to future cases, with effect from 1 June. That is why the Bill's provision, perhaps unusually but appropriately in this context, refers to a change of law after 1 June.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for that answer, but his reference to retrospectivity raises another important question. What is the position of people who have repaid money that they received as a benefit because it was claimed that their condition had improved before a subsequent review? It would be invidious if those virtuous people who paid back the money for the relevant period—they may have an exceptional degree of honesty and social responsibility—suffered a financial loss, and it would be unjust if those who did not respond to the demand for repayment were entirely relieved of their liabilities. How will the Under-Secretary deal with that problem?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There were about 600 cases of overpaid benefit that were in the course of repayment when the Secretary of State's direction was issued at the end of February. No further repayment was required in those cases. However, the money that had already been recovered was not refunded to those claimants, and it would not have been right to have refunded it. If benefit is overpaid and is subsequently properly repaid, it would not be proper to refund it.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I1026">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1015</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Under-Secretary recognise that he is penalising those who have, with alacrity, decency and honesty, repaid sums when asked to do so and rewarding those who did not and who played for time or found some excuse? That is unjust.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying and his point is fair and reasonable. When deciding how to treat cases in which repayment has started, the Government had to consider whether the people concerned were in a position to make repayments. The only justification for writing off the overpayments is that if we insisted on repayment we would force many disabled people, whose only income comes from other benefits, to reduce their income over a long period to make good an overpayment of thousands of pounds. That cannot be right and no one in the Committee would argue that the Government have made the wrong decision in such cases. Those who have started to repay an overpayment will have been in a position to make those repayments.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
It would have been invidious if the Government had then said that because some people had made an early start on repayment, they should be treated differently from those who had delayed in the hope that something might come up. I see the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford shaking his head and I understand his argument. The Government had to make a judgment on the point at which to introduce the changes and we made our decision for the reason I gave.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am genuinely confused and hope that the Under-Secretary will help me. A few moments ago he said that legislation will ensure that the Government recover money only from people who knew or ought to have known of the change in their circumstances or medical condition. I understand that and it is sensible. But I do not understand the relationship to the figure that has been quoted—600. How many people and how much money were involved and how many people either did not know or would not have known that they were being overpaid?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me make it clear that if the Government believe that an overpayment was made as a result of fraud, the overpayment will not be waived and will be reclaimed.<br><br>
In reply to the hon. Gentleman's specific question, around 600 cases of overpaid benefit were in the course of repayment when the Secretary of State's direction was issued. We could not agree that an exception should be made for payments by those 600 people before the direction was issued, because a special scheme would have had to be created to refund money to claimants who were not legally entitled to it in the first place. Anyone who had made an overpayment in the past might legitimately have been able to claim a refund.<br><br>
In reply to the hon. Members for Gainsborough and for Grantham and Stamford, I understand their arguments. The Government have tried to be as fair as possible to all concerned, but we were not in a position
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1016</span>
to repay the overpayment that some people had made without creating a situation in which any person who was required to make a repayment could have made that decision.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford sought further information about how the figure of £50 million, quoted by my hon. Friend the Minister of State on Second Reading, is made up. There are three components. About 2,200 people with outstanding overpayments averaging £5,000 make up the first component, at a cost of more than £11 million. Secondly, about 600 people—those people about whom we have been talking in the past few minutes—were in the process of repaying. Their residual payments, which averaged about £1,000, were written off at a cost of just over £600,000. The third component was an estimated £3.4 million of knock-on overpayment, such as incapacity benefit and housing benefit, where entitlement depended on payment of a disability benefit totalling some £15 million.<br><br>
The clause deals with circumstances in which, following a review, the claimant's entitlement to benefit has been reduced or eliminated. The benefits covered are DLA, attendance allowance and benefits that depend on DLA and attendance allowance, such as the premiums in income-related benefits and the benefits where entitlement depends on the all-work test. That is the answer to the first question asked by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford, which was, what do we mean by severely disabled people? By that, we mean people who are in receipt of the benefits that I have just listed.<br><br>
The change in entitlement might result from ignorance, a mistake about a material fact or a change in the claimant's circumstances, but in either case, it must relate to the effect of his or her disability on the need for help with personal care or mobility or incapacity for work. In such circumstances, the provisions will ensure that the claimant's failure to correct the mistake or report the change does not result in a recoverable overpayment.<br><br>
The clause is limited to cases where overpayment results from changes to the nature and effects of an individual's disability. It does not apply to overpayments created by other changes in the claimant's life, for example, going abroad or going into hospital. Such changes affect entitlement to or payment of most social security benefits. Not only are they readily identifiable but the need to report them to the Benefits Agency is well established.<br><br>
I should also stress that any overpayments resulting from fraud on the claimant's part are not affected by the clause. Such overpayments will continue to be pursued in the usual way. Subsection (6) specifically excludes overpayments where a person has been convicted of a relevant offence or has agreed to pay a penalty as an alternative to prosecution under section 115A of the Social Security Administration Act 1992. Therefore, claims by the Opposition that the Government are going soft on fraud are without foundation.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I1027">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1017</span>
The provisions cover all reviews until 1 June 1999 when new regulations will come into force. We intend to give effect to the clause as soon as possible, which is why amendment No. 334 has been tabled to ensure that the power commences on Royal Assent. That will provide the legislative reassurance that we are seeking at the earliest possible opportunity.<br><br>
I have dealt with the points that have been raised about the costs of the measure. The need to ensure that the amount of benefit paid to claimants is correct at the outset and remains correct is an important element in the Government's programme of welfare reform. That requires systems for checking entitlement that are fair, sensitive and appropriate to the individual circumstances of the claimant. Those requirements are especially important where the claimant is severely ill or disabled. The Government believe that it is essential that the rules on the recoverability of overpayments operate fairly. The clause provides that they do so.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford also asked what would happen if Parliament were to refuse to enact the Bill. The answer is that the accounting officer's direction would stand, as the requirement for his direction would not have been removed. Clearly, if the clause is added, and the Bill is enacted, the need for the accounting officer's direction will be removed.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman expressed his concern that the new review process to replace the benefits integrity project on disability benefits. We do not believe that that will be the case. The new system will be fairer because it will consider all rates of disability living allowance—the middle and lower rates, as well as the higher rates. That will enable the benefit to be increased in appropriate cases—where the care or mobility needs of the client are shown to have increased—as well as being reduced. The aspect of the benefits integrity project that enraged disabled people was that in almost all cases it applied only to the higher rates of benefit. The only possible outcome therefore was a maintenance of the status quo or a reduction. That was patently unfair and that is why the benefits integrity project has been cancelled.<br><br>
We have consulted closely with disability agencies—in regular meetings of the disability benefits forum—on how the replacement arrangements will operate. As a result, we hope that we can build and develop confidence in the system. Such confidence did not exist in relation to the benefits integrity project.<br><br>
I cannot imagine hon. Members on either side of the Committee wanting to insist that the Benefits Agency demands large sums of money—£5,000 on average, or more in some cases—from disabled people who depend on benefits for their existence. I therefore trust that the clause has the support of hon. Members of both sides.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was thoroughly unsatisfactory. It was as unsatisfactory as the performance of the Under Secretary's boss, the Minister of State, on the Floor of the House. Clearly, this matter causes the Government great difficulty and grief. At least I received an answer on the breakdown of the figure of £15 million. We did not receive that on
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1018</span>
the Floor of the House. Perhaps that—if not much else—justifies the time that we spent on the matter this morning.<br><br>
The second confusion to which I referred was created by the Under-Secretary's statement that the clause targeted the severely disabled. He cleared that up by saying that the clause targets anyone who is disabled and who is entitled to such benefits. The use of the phrase "severely disabled" was confusing because it is used in the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 to describe those who are more than 80 per cent. disabled. If I remember rightly, the phrase is used to describe those who qualify for severe disablement allowance after the age of 20. The use of technical terms in social security legislation in such a loose fashion creates confusion and it is reasonable to expect Ministers of the Crown to use language with greater precision. The Under-Secretary now says that the clause applies to anyone entitled to such benefits who would be affected by the new rules on the repayment of benefit. At least we now know the answer to two out of my seven or eight questions.<br><br>
Unfortunately, the Under-Secretary did not clear up the confusion about the proliferation of reviews. After his second response on the matter, we still do not know whether it is true that all recipients of all disability benefits will be subject to a review that is similar to the benefits integrity project review. The postal inquiry or the staff visit at home—</span></p>
<p>12.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On reflection, I did not reply properly to that point. I went through my list of the eight points that the hon. Gentleman made. I thought that I had covered them all, but he rightly says that I did not cover that point. The hon. Gentleman misunderstands what is meant by a review. A review is any review of a decision to grant entitlement to benefit. The term relates simply to that administrative decision. Any benefit that I have described could be reviewed without having to establish an elaborate new review process.<br><br>
When an individual's circumstances change, decisions about his entitlement to benefit have been subject to a review ever since the introduction of welfare benefits. The law lays down the criteria that have to be met before someone is entitled to a benefit. It states that a review is needed when a person's circumstances change—he may be entitled to a higher or lower rate of benefit, or to no benefit.<br><br>
The new clause will deal with the situation in which a change in circumstances leads to a reduction in one of the disability benefits that I specified. Overpayments may have been made during the period before the decision to reduce a benefit was made, but no repayment will be sought if it would have been unreasonable for the person to have known about, or to have notified the Benefits Agency of, that change in circumstances.<br><br>
We are creating not an elaborate series of new reviews but a provision to safeguard the interests of severely disabled people when their benefit is reduced as a result of a review.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I1028">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1019</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At least I shall not be blamed for the Committee spending so long on this subject. After my third intervention and the Under-Secretary's third response, we have now extracted an answer, which he could have given at the outset. The Minister of State could have given us that answer the other day if he had known it, but obviously he did not.<br><br>
If I understood the Under-Secretary's answer correctly, for the purposes of the new clause, a review means any recategorisation of the entitlement of a benefit claimant who is claiming any disability-related benefit, whether that results from an administrative procedure or a medical examination. I am sure that the Under-Secretary will intervene if I have summarised his answer incorrectly. A review means any reconsideration that produces a recategorisation of the entitlement of anyone to a disability-related benefit or to a particular level of that benefit. Is that correct?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would make only one qualification. Where a medical test such as the all-work test or, in future, the personal capability assessment is carried out, it will not determine a person's entitlement to benefit, but will constitute evidence that can be used by the adjudication officer. With that qualification, I do not demur from the hon. Gentleman's remarks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have had to formulate the Government's policy response on this matter. Having done so, I am apparently correct: a review is any administrative decision to recategorise the entitlement of a benefit claimant to a disability-related benefit. Perhaps the Minister of State and the Under-Secretary should have a severe word with their boss, the Secretary of State, because he is responsible for the confusion. On 28 January 1999, the Secretary of State stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"The review process will involve gathering information by postal inquiry and home visits".—[<i>Official Report,</i> 28 January 1999; Vol. 324, c. 321.]</p></blockquote>
That refers to the type of review—it is described as a review—associated with the benefits integrity project. The Government have used the word, "review" and the phrase, "severe disablement" to mean different things in different contexts and that has created great confusion. It has taken the Committee a long time, but thank goodness we are here, because we have eventually clarified the Government's position.<br><br>
Given that we have exhaustively but, I believe, necessarily, considered all of my questions, one might think that I could sit down, but I am afraid that the matter cannot rest there. Unfortunately for Back-Bench Labour Committee members, who are perhaps embarrassed—not for the first time—by the performance of their Front-Bench spokesmen, the Under-Secretary's remarks have created two new sources of confusion. In answer to an earlier question, he said that, if the Bill were not passed by the House, the instruction that was given in February by the accounting officer to the Benefits Agency would still stand. However, the accounting officer's instruction was not to extract money from those who were
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1020</span>
overpaid benefit in the circumstances defined in the new clause, but to forgo retrospectively amounts of money due to the state.<br><br>
Equally, the Under-Secretary said that Parliament will require formal consent to be given to the use of retrospectivity in such circumstances through new primary legislation. The point of my original question was to discover what the true position would be. However, if the Bill were not passed and there were no retrospective endorsement through primary legislation of the accounting officer's instruction to the head of the Benefits Agency, that instruction would still stand. That is what the Under-Secretary told us just a few minutes ago.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The confusion on this point is the hon. Gentleman's. Existing legislation provides the power to pass regulations that will correct overpayments in future cases. Because the power does not exist to do so retrospectively and because there is no primary legislation that deals with this matter, the Secretary of State was required to make a direction to safeguard disabled people to whom overpayments have been made. The simple question that Committee members must decide is whether the Secretary of State was right to decline to collect overpayments from those disabled people. If they believe that he made the right decision, they should vote for the clause, but if they believe that he should have sought overpayments from those disabled people, they should vote down the clause. The direction would still stand and hon. Members would have the opportunity to pursue the issue further on the Floor of the House.<br><br>
The issue is straightforward: if the Secretary of State did the right thing on overpayments, let the clause stand part of the Bill. If hon. Members think that he did the wrong thing, they should vote it down and explain why those payments should be collected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand why the Government want to shift the argument on to a point of principle. The issue has now become the competence and coherence of Government initiatives that were designed to achieve a purpose common to both sides of the Committee.<br><br>
I said on the Floor of the House that the clawing back of benefit from people on the problematic grounds that their condition may have improved at some indeterminate time before a review took place was not an objective that should be pursued. Any decision as to the date from which that improvement may have taken place would necessarily be arbitrary. We have a common purpose, on both sides of the Committee, to enact proposals that would ensure that that did not happen. However, we are not sure that the Government are competent to enact, or even to formulate, such a proposal, or that they know what they are doing. The Opposition are worried that the Government often do not know what they are doing.<br><br>
I put it to the Minister that the best way to make progress is for me to formulate potential answers to the questions that I am asking him and then to ask him
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I1029">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1021</span>
whether he accepts that formulation. He would not then have to write the essay, he would simply have to check a box and tick the answer if it was correct.<br><br>
The Minister has not said so himself, but I suggest that the purpose of the primary legislation is to protect the position of disabled people who will receive a higher rate of benefit than that to which they were entitled under the current regulations before 26 February. I think that that was the date on which the accounting officer sent that instruction to the head of the Benefits Agency. The Minister has just told the Committee that that accounting officer's instruction fully protects people from 26 February.<br><br>
In fact, people who had had claims made on them before 26 February—or whatever date it was—and had not by that time complied with the instruction to repay, would be retrospectively relieved by the provisions of the new clause. I believe that that is the position that the Minister has just put to the Committee. I shall give way to him if I have got it wrong.<br><br>
That is the purpose of the primary legislation; that is why it is required. I see that the Minister is receiving some assistance from an invisible quarter. If he would like me to give way when he has read through it, I shall do so. However, that is the essence of the new clause and it brings me to the worst aspect of the matter: the Government's remarkable talent for pursuing a sensible, sound purpose that we support, but in so doing creating not only an appalling muddle but a gratuitous source of new injustice.<br><br>
We are told that people who responded to a demand to repay have lost out and have not been protected. They were honest, straightforward and decent enough
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1022</span>
to say, "My goodness, perhaps I did get more benefit than I was entitled to. It would be easy to argue the toss, because it is not clear on what date the improvement in my condition occurred. How could that be verified anyway? Nevertheless, I will pay back to the state the money that this bureaucracy is asking for."<br><br>
However, people who decided to argue the toss and play for time have been protected, which is undesirable. Good governance must consist of rewarding virtuous behaviour and penalising behaviour that is less than virtuous and less than socially responsible. The Government appear to be doing the reverse.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Good conduct in Committee consists of not making the same argument time and again, as the hon. Gentleman is doing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not recall formulating that particular principle.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Yes, the hon. Gentleman did.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a principle that should be applied in every area of government. If I have formulated it—in a different context—I am sure that I was right to do so. It is directly relevant to how the Government have carried on—</span></p>
