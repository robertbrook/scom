	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 37 in page 3, line 38, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2C) An employer who is responsible for the tax credit received by an employee shall take reasonable precautions so that the fact an employee is in receipt of tax credit is not disclosed to any other employee except those directly responsible for the administration of the payroll.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Good morning, Mrs. Roe. I hope that you enjoy this sitting of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendments is to explore confidentiality issues. Opposition Members are worried that the details of people's private affairs could get into the public domain of a company. Employers do their best to ensure that payroll details remain as private as possible, but the information required in payroll departments is highly intrusive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Minister for sending us the draft application form, which I read with interest last night. If I were the sort of person who checked texts, I would suggest that one or two matters required examination. Having read the form and the information required for the Inland Revenue to calculate working families tax credit and child care tax allowances, it is clear that if people wanted to pry into other people's affairs they could do so merely by knowing the information that is required to complete the payroll. It is easy for people to surmise and gossip and they do not depend on firm information. Any change in the rate at which the tax credit is paid could be an immediate cause for surmise. We all know how Chinese whispers work, "Have you seen that so and so is receiving so much more or so much less? I wonder why that is." In no time at
	<span class='label label-info column'>162</span>
all, mountains of speculation have arisen about people's personal circumstances, which they may wish to remain confidential.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steve Webb 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Northavon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There may be a problem for people who are paid in cash instead of through a pay slip. Perhaps the hon. Lady will invite the Minister to comment on the fact that some people are still paid in cash and that it may be apparent, when the pay packet contains a larger wad of cash, that the tax credit is in it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right and I suspect from the tenor of his comments that he, like me, would prefer people not to be paid in cash for security reasons and because the temptation of going to the pub—that takes us back to our previous debate—is much stronger if payment is in cash. Perhaps the Minister will enlighten us on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Payment in cash may increase the possibility of people knowing whether a pay packet is thicker or thinner than the previous week—they would need to be eagle eyed. It piles on questions about the confidentiality aspect of the information that employers are required to hold, which increases the opportunities for employees to speculate on people's personal circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem ranges across companies, irrespective of size. The fairly large company that I spoke to employed thousands of people, but it had not fully taken on board the effects of the Bill. A great deal needs to be done to ensure that the business sector is aware of the Bill's implications. In our discussion, representatives of the company immediately saw the problems, in particular that of confidentiality. Its payroll section, which was not subcontracted, employed a large percentage of women.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ivan Lewis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bury, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady comment on the fact that it should be taken as read that any company with a payroll section or any other mechanism for calculating salaries, allowances and so on should keep those details confidential? Any changes that are made to people's salaries and take-home pay—be they to tax codes or marriage allowance—could give rise to speculation if people who operate those systems in companies do not behave professionally. I assume that most companies that operate payroll and personnel systems maintain confidentiality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is agreeing with me. I hope that companies maintain confidentiality, but there is no guarantee that people's circumstances will not get into the public domain. The volume of information and its effect on take-home pay will be so apparent, that it will be easy for an inadvertent word to make a person's circumstances more widely known than that person may want. Our point is that the sheer volume of information that is required might expose people to gossip about their circumstances. None of us would want that. The amendments would ensure that that possibility is minimised. We must recognise that it is impossible to make anything totally secure. Surely we can agree on that. After all, newspapers would not carry the stories that they do if information about people was completely secure. The situation is the same in companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0449">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>163</span>
I hope that the hon. Member for Bury, South (Mr. Lewis) will agree that there are problems. They have caused us to be worried about confidentiality. The calibre and professionalism of most members of most payroll sections is beyond reproach. But there are inadvertent words and rogue elements. Someone knows someone who knows someone and the penny drops—that is why so and so has moved next door to so and so. We know how that happens. We can trace its path. We are trying to minimise and to warn against the Bill's potential for confidentiality to be broken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The well-run company that I spoke to was aware of the problems of confidentiality. We are not just talking about small businesses. The problem goes across the spectrum where there is potential for gossip about people's affairs in a way that many people may not want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have been able to make the Committee aware of the problems that could arise from the Bill and the likely impact on company payrolls and payroll departments. If employees are going through a difficult time, such as splitting with their husband or wife or facing other changes in family circumstances, the last thing that they need is further pressure on them because of gossip about circumstances that they may not wish people to know about. The Bill may therefore create further problems—the gossip may get everything out of proportion. How does the Minister think that that can be avoided?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric Pickles 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brentwood and Ongar)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that the usual channels have the timing of the Bill right. It is possible that we will finish today; however, our initial instincts are that we shall take longer. I see the Whip disagreeing and looking a little grumpy, but let me explain, as I am sure that he will agree with me in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The more that we have gone into the Bill and begun to deal with important aspects, the more we have moved towards consensus. I regard the intervention of the hon. Member for Bury, South in the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) as extremely useful, because clearly hon. Members on both sides of the Committee are saying the same thing: we understand the need for confidentiality. The hon. Gentleman's intervention went some way towards the point that I was about to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that, under the Bill, firms will for the first time be used to administer a benefit to their employees. Therefore, on top of their traditional duty to ensure confidentiality through the payroll system, there will be a little bit extra: it will be confidentiality plus. We know this because firms will use a different method of assessment for family credits. Previously, only one intervention was necessary—to certify that a person worked there and that his or her salary was right. A reassessment will now take place every six months that will involve the firm in paying out benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham touched on another point—the question of esteem in the eyes of fellow employees. We know, because of the Social
	<span class='label label-info column'>164</span>
Security Committee's excellent report on fraud, of the problems with family credit. We also know, because of the work of the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field), that working families tax credit will provide even more opportunity for fraud. Therefore, those on working families tax credit will be particularly prone to accusations that they are fiddling the system or getting more than they are entitled to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the briefest look at the form—and I thank the Financial Secretary for ensuring that we received it—it is clear that anyone who wants to commit a fraud will find it easy, because the form is riddled with opportunities for fraud. Those who fill it in will command the benefit. Given the way in which the system will be checked, it will be riddled with fraud. The working families tax credit will therefore be a particularly discredited form of benefit. Firms will have to take that into account, because it will cause major disruption in the workplace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bury, South is right to point to an existing tradition of protecting people's confidentiality through the pay-as-you-earn system. However, the amendment would apply an extra test and puts in reasonable terms the steps that should be taken. Currently, the level of protection offered by the PAYE system is inadequate. For the most part, employers will be resentful of the extra burden that the Bill will impose. We must make it clear to employers that we are aware of the difficulties that the extra burden will create and that we understand the resentment they will feel at being asked to do the Government's job by handing out benefits. However, they should also understand that the system must work, and that employee confidentiality is central to it. Employers, who will be involved in the private financial affairs of their employees to an unprecedented extent, have a duty to ensure the protection of employee confidentiality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ivan Lewis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman comment on the implications of his rhetoric, which suggest that employers need to be told, through a Bill, to maintain the confidentiality of their employees' financial affairs. What does that say about the current state of the Opposition's relationship with the business community?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, the hon. Gentleman is trying to bale out from his earlier position which, I recall, prompted an expression of sheer disgust on the face of his Whip. If launching such an attack against me was intended to tackle that problem, I am prepared to respond in kind by saying that his comments were outrageously partisan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Politics is not about protecting a rainbow coalition. It is not a matter of saying that the Conservative party is the party of business and bosses must always get their way, or that the Labour party is the party of the workers. This issue is not about class, but about standing for the whole community. We need to ensure the protection of the privacy of the individual. It is not merely a matter of human rights and dignity, but of ensuring that a company's work force contributes to its smooth running. Gossip and resentment must be minimised and people should not be made scapegoats.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0450">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>165</span>
The working families tax credit will prove divisive and will create a stigma and all manner of problems in the work force. The amendment seeks to ensure that all reasonable steps are taken to protect employee's privacy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bury, South should not have tried to bale himself out. He should be proud of the stand that he took this morning, albeit briefly, on behalf of the individual. The Whip, who is a reasonable man, will forget the incident. Within two, three or four years it will be written out of the file.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Gibb 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Good morning, Mrs. Roe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would require employers to take reasonable precautions to ensure that only those who deal directly with the payroll are aware of which employees are in receipt of the working families tax credit, or the disabled person's tax credit. Instead of the normal practices of business with regard to the confidentiality of an employee's salary—which the hon. Member for Bury, South pointed out—the Bill should insist on confidentiality. That is because the credit is a statutory benefit, which is paid through the payroll. The same statutory protections should therefore be applied by the employer as would be applied by the Department of Social Security.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee has discussed at great length the question of whether paying WFTC through the payroll will increase or decrease the stigma attached. Opposition Members believe that that poses the significant risk that claiming benefits will become known to work colleagues. Although such risk is not confined to small companies—as my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham said—it will be increased in small firms using manually produced pay slips. As the hon. Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb) said, many people are still paid in cash in a weekly pay packet, and such people will undoubtedly have hand-written pay slips accompanying the cash payments—many people who are paid directly by bank giro credit will also have hand-written pay slips. Therefore, one or two people in the payroll department—or even the company's financial controller may know all the financial details of employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Employees of big firms talk about their salaries, even though they are not supposed to, and it causes all sorts of difficulties. The same thing happens in small companies. Human nature dictates that people will gossip about other employees' benefit claims when they realise that they are paid through the payroll. What is problematic about inserting a reasonably worded amendment requiring employers to take reasonable precautions? We are not suggesting that employers should ensure that not a single scintilla of detail leaks out, on pain of imprisonment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not only employers' organisations that are worried about this matter. Organisations such as the National Council for One Parent Families are also worried. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Some lone parents may worry that their personal finances are becoming more visible to colleagues and employers causing a disincentive to take up benefits."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>166</span>
That proves our point—if employees are paid the benefit through the payroll, the fact of that payment may leak out to fellow employees, which will not only increase the stigma attached to the benefit but provide a disincentive to taking it up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Northavon pointed out that the take-up rate of family credit among lone parents is 91 per cent. Therefore, if fundamental changes to that benefit are made in the form of WFTC, the take-up rate can only go down. Given the risk of leaking of information to fellow employees, which will bring an added stigma, the take-up rate is bound to fall. We want to mitigate the damage that the Bill will do: we want to improve the Bill for the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Federation of Small Businesses has stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The proposal will force employers to become involved in their workers' personal situations, imposing on workers' privacy."</p></blockquote>
Organisations representing lone parents and organisations representing small businesses believe that confidentiality is essential to making the Bill work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend referred to the National Council for One Parent Families. Does he recall reading its clear statement that employers who deal with this matter may need guidance on sensitivity?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. Later, we will discuss an amendment relating to the code of conduct for employers. All organisations that had read and thought about the Bill realise that the lack of confidentiality is the big flaw in the decision to pay WFTC through the payroll. If the Government were to adopt the amendment, they would go a long way towards mitigating the damage that the Bill will cause and making it less flawed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Barbara Roche)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Good morning, Mrs. Roe. It is a pleasure to have you with us again this morning. The contribution of the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) ranged rather wide. I was also tempted to do so, but I will resist that temptation and return to the amendment proposed by the hon. Member for Beckenham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the context of the hon. Lady's amendment. Hon. Members are right to be concerned that employees' private financial affairs should be treated as confidential. However, it is unclear whether such a provision would ensure that. I hope to reassure hon. Members about the current position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Employers are already under a common law duty to maintain the trust and confidence of employees. That is, potentially, a wide duty, and the Data Protection Act 1998 will extend the protection of personal information. That is why the amendments are unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Itemised pay statements are already prepared by other employees and, in practice, treated as confidential between employer and employee—my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, South mentioned that that procedure already exists—but that has never been regarded as a matter that required statutory provisions relating to confidentiality. Tax credits will be shown on payslips and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0451">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>167</span>
will, therefore, be treated with the same confidentiality as pay. There is no logical reason why employers should be any less discreet about tax credit details than pay details.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further point that must be taken into account in considering the amendment is that it is unclear what "reasonable precautions" means. How is that to be determined? are employers required to put in place special arrangements? If so, that could involve additional burdens for business—burdens that we would not want to impose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also unclear how the Inland Revenue could police employers' behaviour in this area. Even if the Revenue could control employers' administration systems, as the amendments would require, what would be the sanction against the employer? What would be the right of appeal against the sanction? If adopted, the amendments would give rise to a whole new regime of employer compliance, which I am sure was not the intention of the hon. Member for Beckenham in tabling the amendment. As I have already said, I understand the concerns that the hon. Lady expressed—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Webb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sense that the Minister is just about to draw her remarks to a close. Before she does, will she deal with a point that was raised by several hon. Members? As far as she is aware—perhaps she has received a briefing on this—will the Bill have any privacy implications for people who are paid in cash, and how prevalent is such payment in this section of the labour market?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All the existing privacy law that governs the relationship between employer and employee will also relate to those who are paid in cash. I cannot tell the Committee how many people that is, but we estimate that it is very few. However, I assure the hon. Gentleman that the same considerations will apply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with what the Minister is saying, but we are worried about confidentiality. The Government should reflect on the issue, and take their provisions further. Our concern is that people will be stigmatised at work, and we do not want that to happen. We should find ways of making it abundantly clear that records must be kept confidential. It is not adequate to say, "I am sorry. The proposal is very difficult and will cause all kinds of problems. How will it be policed and enforces?" That problem runs through the Bill—most of its provisions will be difficult to police and enforce.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his intervention, which gives me the opportunity to correct what may be a misapprehension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is fatally flawed and would involve the complications that I outlined. However, provisions emphasising confidentiality and protection are already in place, and they apply to details about an employee's financial position, including, for example, his rent and pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall end as I began by saying that I understand why the hon. Member for Beckenham phrased the amendment
	<span class='label label-info column'>168</span>
as she did. It was important that she did so—she gave me an opportunity to set out the Government's position on the matter. Our proceedings are—quite rightly—followed closely by people with an interest in the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eccles)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend accept that a balance is involved? The Government are responsible for ensuring that the Bill adequately deals with confidentiality, which is an important and serious matter, but the relationship between an employer and an employee involves a balance. In my experience—I spent 20 years in industry as a trade union officer—most disciplinary procedures adequately deal with confidentiality by treating it as a breach of contract, which is a serious disciplinary matter. The Opposition's valid concerns will be dealt with—at least in some respects—by the rules that already exist in industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention. He speaks with much experience of industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the overwhelming majority of cases, questions of confidentiality are handled properly and sensitively by employers, the great majority of whom have a proper system in place. However, when there is a difficulty, existing provisions, which may derive from legislation or from common law, already provide protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier, I understand why the hon. Member for Beckenham raised the matter, and I am grateful to her for doing so. I hope that I have persuaded her that the amendment is not necessary. However, if she feels that she cannot withdraw it I advise my hon. Friends to vote against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Financial Secretary for her reasonable explanation, which all Opposition Members appreciate. However, I have to confess that I still have some concerns. I understand the role of common law and the point that was made by the hon. Member for Eccles (Mr. Stewart) but, if I may be so bold, his point applies principally to large companies. I know that I cited the example of a large company with a problem, but my argument was based on an employer's response to me. The problem exists not only in the large company sector but in the smaller company sector, which may not have the elaborate rule structure to which the hon. Gentleman referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was interesting that the Financial Secretary, when referring to the Data Protection Act 1998—thank goodness for the flexibility of the English language—used the words "will seek", which does not imply that the rules will be in place immediately. I am sure that they will come in quickly, but we may find ourselves with a hiatus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For one moment I thought that the Financial Secretary would take the amendment away and redraft it. I would have accepted that offer with alacrity. However, because she did not do so and because I still have concerns about this new system of paying benefit, I urge my hon. Friends to join me in pressing the amendment to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 38, in page 3, line 36, after 'calculated', insert
	<br><blockquote><p>', but to exclude any interest charge where an overpayment arose as a result of incorrect instructions from the Inland Revenue.'.</p></blockquote>
Clause 5(2)(f) provides that regulations shall be made for charging interest on sums due to the Revenue. The amendment would prevent any regulation made under that paragraph from enabling the Inland Revenue to charge interest on sums due by the employer, where the employer has been incorrectly notified of money to be paid to an employer and goes ahead and pays the money to the employee. In due course, the Revenue learns that the sum paid is wrong and tells the employer that he should have paid a different sum or no sum at all. If the employer then tries to recover the money from the employee and there is a delay in doing so—for example, the employee may have left—it would be inequitable to charge the employer interest on that money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may have misunderstood how and when interest will be applied, but that is inherent from the way in which the Bill is drafted. The amendment would make it clear that, if excessive money is paid to the employee as a result of incorrect notification by the Revenue, no fault will apply to the employer and interest will not be charged on the money owed back to the Inland Revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be helpful if the Financial Secretary could clarify another point on a similar theme. Will an employer be required to pay the Inland Revenue interest on the funding provided to the employer under regulation 7 of the Draft Tax Credits (Payments by Employers) Regulations 1999? Those are the regulations that enable the Revenue to fund employers who would suffer a cash-flow problem in paying working families tax credit and disabled person's tax credit, because they are paying more out in those benefits than they are receiving in PAYE and national insurance contributions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment proposes that interest should not be charged where an overpayment arises from incorrect instruction by the Inland Revenue. Interest will be charged and paid on sums overpaid or underpaid. As I am sure the hon. Gentleman knows, that applies to the rest of the tax system, and of course it is right that it should apply to tax credits, but the interest will run only from the end of the tax year, as happens with PAYE. If the employer and the board have rectified the error by
	<span class='label label-info column'>170</span>
then, no interest will be charged. However—I hope that this will reassure the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb)—arrangements already exist to deal with the sort of situation envisaged by the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Inland Revenue discovers that misleading information or incorrect advice from Revenue staff contributed to the late payment of tax, part or all of the interest charged will be given up. That is covered in guidelines published by the Inland Revenue, and will depend on the circumstances of each case. It would, therefore, not be appropriate to enshrine that sort of arrangement in legislation. However, I assure the Committee that the same arrangements will also apply where a mistake by the Inland Revenue in relation to working families tax credit payments result in an interest charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked about refunding. I can tell him that no interest will be charged in those circumstances. I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman, and that he will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's response was helpful in clarifying that no interest will be charged in the event of incorrect notification by the Revenue in the circumstances set out in the Revenue guidelines. However, it is a pity that more and more reliance is being put on Revenue guidelines, which receive no parliamentary scrutiny. That is an issue of concern outside the House, especially among tax professionals. It is better to debate such issues in the House and include them in legislation rather than pass legislation that gives the Revenue the power to charge interest and then, subsequently, to mitigate those measures in a Revenue guideline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, given the Pepper v. Hart case, it is helpful that the Minister referred to that guideline in Committee and has assured the Committee that interest will not be charged in those circumstances. It is also helpful that the Minister has made it clear—because this is not clear in the regulations—that no interest will be charged on funding if the employer pays out more in working families tax credit and disabled person's tax credit than is received in PAYE and national insurance contributions. In view of the helpfulness of the Minister's statements, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move the amendment No. 32, in page 3, line 38, after 'appeal', insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(h) for funding the administration costs incurred in paying the credit by employers whose annual National Insurance contribution payments do not exceed £20,000.'.</p></blockquote>
We have been discussing the very real costs and burdens that the Bill imposes on employers, both large and small. The regulatory impact assessment demonstrates that the Bill will impose more than £100 million of recurring annual costs on British industry. As most people will suspect, such assessments tend to underestimate rather than overestimate the costs. Of the £100 million, £49 million will be borne by employers with fewer than 100 employees. It is also clear from the regulatory impact assessment that £35 million of annual costs will be borne
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0453">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>171</span>
by employers with fewer than 10 employees. Thus one third of the costs of the Bill will be borne by very small employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would mitigate some of the damage that the Bill will cause by enabling the Inland Revenue to provide some assistance for small companies and small employers by bearing the extra costs that will result from administering the working families tax credit and disabled persons tax credit through the payroll. In its report, entitled "Implementation of Tax Credits", the Social Security Select Committee expressed concern about the responsiveness of the Inland Revenue in providing funding for employers who pay out more in working families tax credit than they receive from PAYE and national insurance contributions. It was also concerned about the extra burden of administration costs on small employers. Its report says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We recommend that small employers who administer WFTC should be awarded reimbursement of their costs similar to that which currently applies in relation to Statutory Maternity Pay, whereby small employers are entitled to an additional payment of 7 per cent. of the payment of SMP."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Webb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have an awful lot of sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's general point. Will he tell the Committee how small firms are defined in relation to the additional payment for administering statutory maternity pay and whether that definition is the same as in his amendment? My reservation about the amendment is whether one wants to put in the Bill a specific amount, which might have to be changed every year with amendment to primary legislation. It might be better to stipulate something general in the Bill and then specify the precise figure in regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the hon. Gentleman's point. The definition of small company in the amendment is the same as that used for statutory maternity pay in the regulations, which specify the figure. If that is inconvenient and the Government are prepared to legislate on the matter in another way, I would accept that, but we adhere to the basic principle. I hope that the Government will accept the amendment and that when they prepare the regulations they will have such a payment in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is also the view of the Low Pay Unit, which stated in a briefing to Committee members:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It should be the responsibility of the Inland Revenue to make sure that WFTC is paid on time and in full, with the employers acting only as intermediary."</p></blockquote>
It continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any administrative cost incurred in paying it should be reimbursed, at least for small employers. Similar schemes exist for SMP and SSP".</p></blockquote>
The definition used in relation to statutory maternity pay and statutory sick pay, as I mentioned in an intervention on the hon. Member for Northavon, is an employer who collects less than £20,000 annually in national insurance contributions from employees. That definition, used in Statutory Maternity Benefits (Compensation of Employers) and Miscellaneous Amendment Regulations 1994, is the same as that used in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>172</span>
If the Government accept the principle of the amendment, but find the point raised by the hon. Member for Northavon compelling and wish to legislate by another method to enable me £20,000 to be index linked so that it does not give the administrative benefit to smaller and smaller employers as time goes by, we would accept that assurance from the Minister. Without that assurance, the matter is important enough to be pressed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would require the board to fund the administration costs incurred in paying tax credits by employers whose annual national insurance contribution payments do not exceed £20,000. My comments to the Committee on this amendment will be very similar to those on amendment No. 10.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tax system does not provide and has never provided, as the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton knows from his background outside the House, a direct subsidy or compensation to employers who fulfil their obligations is relation to tax. As I said on amendment No. 10, employers are not reimbursed for operating the PAYE system and I can see no reason why the payment of tax credits should be treated differently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have said many times that the Government are committed to trying to ensure that burdens on employers are kept to the minium necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Webb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that no allowance is made for administering PAYE, but the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton pointed out that a special regime exists for statutory maternity pay. Is the Minister saying that the administration of the working families tax credit is so different from the administration of statutory maternity pay that completely different arguments apply? Surely the delivery of statutory maternity pay involves the same issues as the delivery of the WFTC.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. However, I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention, which goes to the heart of the Bill and exposes the political and philosophical differences between the Government and the Opposition. We believe that the Bill involves not a benefit but a tax—it is a Treasury Bill. I know that I have said that on several occasions, but it is important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Webb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We still do not believe the Financial Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point exposes the difference between the Government and the Opposition. Those differences lie behind some of the amendments—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am baffled by the Financial Secretary's refusal to accept the similarity between statutory maternity pay—and statutory sick pay—and the WFTC. Her argument all along has been that paying WFTC through the payroll will reduce stigma by associating payments with work, but no stigma is attached to statutory maternity pay or to statutory sick pay. I bet that all Committee members in their previous employments were sick at some time, and that their employer claimed statutory sick pay on their behalf. Zero stigma attaches to those benefits. Surely the Financial Secretary is trying to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0454">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>173</span>
associate the WFTC with those benefits. To say that there is a complete distinction blows a hole through her entire argument—invalid though it already is—that the WFTC would reduce stigma. The Government previously claimed that the benefits are meant to be similar, but the Financial Secretary just argued that they are completely different.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The hon. Gentleman has totally misunderstood the point. I drew an analogy with the taxation system, of which our proposal is a part, and with the PAYE system. He must keep that comparison in mind. When WFTC payments are made through the pay-packet employers will be able to set off the amounts paid against their PAYE and NIC liabilities. If the tax credits to be paid are expected to exceed all of those deductions, employers will, as we explained, be able to apply to the Inland Revenue for funding, and they will be able to do so before paying the tax credit, which will ensure that a company will not be out of pocket.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Employers whose national insurance liability does not exceed £20,000 will tend to be small employers, and they will incur some costs, but we will continue to work—as we have all along—with employers' representatives to minimise those costs. The compliance costs will vary according to various factors, including the payroll system used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our proposals have to be seen in the context of the many measures that we have introduced to help business. We firmly believe that a system that upholds and reinforces the dignity of work will feed through into the business world, where it might help the relationships that small companies have with their employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the arguments that I have used in this debate I have previously used in other contexts. Our debate may reveal the political differences between the Government and the Opposition. If the amendment is pressed to a Division, I advise my hon. Friends to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was an unsatisfactory response. The Financial Secretary referred to the administration of PAYE, but we all know that the WFTC will not be paid through the PAYE code. It will be a separate item on a payslip—the Inland Revenue will give a separate notification of the amount to be paid, which will be based on a daily rate that the employer must multiply to calculate the amount to include in the pay-packet. It is wrong to say that WFTC is part of the PAYE system. The Office for National Statistics clearly said that it is not integral to the tax system. It does not depend on an employee's marginal tax rate and can only be calculated independently of the tax system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Julie Kirkbride 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bromsgrove)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. There is a crucial difference. In the same way that statutory maternity pay and statutory sick pay require a different funding process from taxes, which are paid out of money earned as part of a straightforward cash flow from employers to the Revenue, employers will be asked to claim money from the Revenue to pay their employees a benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that valid point. Working families tax credit is similar to statutory maternity pay and statutory sick pay, both of
	<span class='label label-info column'>174</span>
which involve payments going to the employee that do not come from deductions from the employee's salary or wage. The Government's best argument for the working families tax credit is that it will reduce stigma and is part of the payroll system. A better argument would be made by comparing it to statutory maternity pay and statutory sick pay. The Financial Secretary rejected that by saying that there is no similarity because they are simply benefits paid through the payroll system. But the working families tax credit and the disabled persons tax credit are also benefits that are paid through the tax system. Everyone understands that, even the Ministers, who pretend not to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no political difference. This is not an issue of philosophy, but a straightforward difference of understanding of how the tax and benefits systems work. WFTC is not a tax issue because it is a benefit paid through the payroll system. The Government are wrong to impose a huge burden on business, especially the disproportionate burden that will fall on small businesses. The amendment would have helped to ameliorate that. However, as time is brief, and despite the Financial Secretary's inadequate answer, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am sure that you are familiar with that, Mrs. Roe. The Government have an opportunity to be embraced in redemption. The Committee is giving the House the chance to reassert itself. The hon. Member for Bury, South (Mr. Lewis) took the first tentative step towards redemption. We are offering other Labour Members the opportunity to join him on that long march. We have a chance to make history and to ensure that the House of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0455">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>175</span>
Commons starts to do what most people, when they elect Members of Parliament, think it does, which is scrutinise law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a senior and experienced Member of the House of Commons, Mrs. Roe, you will know that the use of secondary legislation has increased. Committees do not have the opportunity to affect that legislation. About 1,600 statutory instruments were passed by the House last year. Few received the scrutiny that they should have received. That is endemic in the system. We are faced with a charming Minster, like the Financial Secretary, who stonewalls for the Government. It matters not a jot or tittle if Opposition Members, or even Government Members, have worries that the statutory instrument may be fundamentally flawed or have something wrong with it, because Committees cannot change it: they must take it or leave it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was never a Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Shame!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was an apparatchik at central office—overworked and no pay. That was my view at the time. That is why I have never kept a cat, because in July I would fear for its safety. I can imagine what it would be like in the Secretary of State's office if a Minister of State or Parliamentary Secretary said, "Secretary of State, I got to the Committee, I found that what we were producing was inadequate, I listened to what the Committee said and I thought that the best thing to do would be to withdraw it." I have a feeling that, the way the system works, the Secretary of State would not say, "Well done, O faithful servant" and send the Minister out to deal with some more Bills. The Bill always has to go through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of the pressure of scrutiny, I see an increasing trend. A couple of weeks after a Committee has finished, one gets a nice little note. I have not spoken for the Opposition on statutory instruments more than 10 times, but I have already had two notes saying, "We have now discovered that clause 37 has proved to be inadequate and is creating a problem that was unforseen at the time." Was it heck unforseen at the time. I have the Committee record to prove how wrong that statement was; we had listened to the Government who explained how the Bill would be perfectly all right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some instruments so greatly affect the liberty of our citizens that we should have the opportunity to amend them. Why here? First, we want to debate this issue. Secondly, the Bill has been nicknamed the Henry III Bill, after that 16th century military tyrant. I look across at the Financial Secretary and I cannot think of anyone less like a 16th century military tyrant and I understand how hurtful such a remark will be to her.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the clauses of the Bill might as well be one clause, saying that the Government can do what they want. We are saying—I put it gently, because we are moving towards the conclusion of the Committee—that the Bill is immensely important. It will affect the liberty, the rights and the purse or wallet of our electors. They expect us to give the Bill some scrutiny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>176</span>
I recently had an opportunity to listen to the Leader of the House talking on a radio programme about precisely that problem. She said, as many Labour Members say when first answering a question, "It was all the previous Government's fault, because they started this process of secondary legislation." However, both under the previous Government and this Government there has been an acceleration in the use of these forms of secondary legislation. To say that the previous Government did it is not an inadequate response. It is like saying "I'm an alcoholic now, but it was all the fault of the person who gave me that first shandy all those years ago."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee gives us an opportunity to do what our electors expect us to do—amend legislation on their behalf.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will be brief. I cannot match my hon. Friend's lyrical and revivalist eloquence, but I thoroughly enjoyed and support his views. Another of the Opposition's goals is to give the House of Commons—and the House of Lords, whatever form it might take—the opportunity to debate those details of the Bill that we have not debated. The flaws in the philosophy behind the Bill have become apparent as we have examined different clauses; we expect those flaws to be magnified in the regulations. That is why amendment No. 41 states that both Houses of Parliament should debate the regulations in detail—the Bill refers to "either House of Parliament".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have raised issues that are of great importance to a range of different bodies representing the people who will be most directly affected. With the utmost respect and humility, the use of the negative resolution procedure in one or other House of Parliament would significantly limit the opportunities of the British people, through their elected and non-elected representatives, to draw attention to any problems with the details of the Bill. Hon. Members have a responsibility to debate such matters, but the opportunity to do so is expressly forbidden by the Bill. Parliament's new two and a half day week—from the point of view of the Government's programme—gives us plenty of time to debate the regulations. It is a negation of the role of Members of Parliament to spend only two and a half days a week on such matters. We should be spending four, if not five, days debating the details of legislation, which directly and crucially affect our electors.

The three amendments relate to some of our worries about the proliferation of secondary legislation in this and other Bills. The delegated powers described in clause 5(1)—there are a number of them, which are set out in paragraphs (a) to (g)—amount to the whole architecture and configuration of the WFTC and DPTC. We believe that that architecture should be in the Bill. Those who read the Bill from cover to cover—perhaps Labour Members have done so since I warned them about not reading it last week—without reading the accompanying
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0456">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>177</span>
glossy document from the Inland Revenue or the plethora of draft regulations spawned by the Bill, will not have any idea how WFTC or DPTC will work. Even the basic architecture will be decided by secondary legislation, which is wrong. The whole architecture should be dealt with in the Bill, rather than through secondary legislation, but if such legislation is to be used it should not be implemented by way of negative resolution. In effect, Parliament will be unable to debate the Government's whim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 40 would delete clause 5(3)(a), which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Regulations under this section…may make different provision for different cases or circumstances".</p></blockquote>
That phrase is too wide-ranging. Were we not debating the provision, which will empower the Inland Revenue to make regulations in specific cases or circumstances, it would verge on the hybrid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 41 concerns clause 5(3)(b) and would change a negative resolution procedure into an affirmative resolution procedure, which would guarantee that Parliament can at least debate these important regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 48 would introduce the new concept of a super-affirmative resolution procedure, which is recommended in the report by the Select Committee on Social Security, House of Commons 29, entitled "Tax and Benefits: Implementation of Tax Credits". In it, the Committee expressed concern at the way in which the working families tax credit is likely to be implemented. The report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Inland Revenue's willingness to consult…regarding the detail of secondary legislation does not address the more fundamental issue of adequate parliamentary scrutiny of major change. Even if the affirmative procedure is used…this is a 'take-it-or-leave-it' process which is one of debate, not detailed examination; and, again, amendment is not possible."</p></blockquote>
The super-affirmative procedure was originally proposed during the previous Parliament by the Select Committee on Procedure. It requires Ministers' proposals to be submitted to both Houses and to be scrutinised in detail by Committees, which may draw on outside evidence and propose amendments. To be enacted, the regulations must then be passed by both Houses. That is a more satisfactory method of dealing with these important regulations, and I urge the Committee to support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have enjoyed the debate, particularly the speech by the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar. On Second Reading, he referred to Henry VIII and I wondered whether he would mention that monarch again. I believe that he also quoted from the Marie Lloyd song—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: "Every one an 'Enery".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since Second Reading, I have waited for the opportunity to recite to the hon. Gentleman the words of that song:
	<br><blockquote><p>Every one an 'Enery, never a Willie or a Sam. I am 'er eighth old man called 'Enery—'Enery the VIIII am".</p></blockquote>
That was the great song of the widow next door, which I am sure that he knows well. I should make it clear that I am not offering to form a singing partnership with the hon. Gentleman once our proceedings have finished,
	<span class='label label-info column'>178</span>
tempting though that may be. In saying so, I do not wish to cast aspersions on the quality of his singing voice. Mine is absolutely dreadful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Webb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am fascinated by the point that the Minister makes. The tax credit—I hesitate to mention the phrase—will transfer money from wives to husbands. Is not Henry VIII precisely the sort of man to whom the credit should not be given?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yet again, we see the wisdom of the interventions of the hon. Member for Northavon. He has enabled me to reassure the Committee that the Bill has no Henry VIII clauses. As you will know, Mrs. Roe, Henry VIII clauses confer power on the Executive to amend statutes through delegated legislation and that is not the Government's intention in this case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would combine the aims of amendments Nos. 40 and 41. First, it would remove the power to make regulations for different cases and circumstances. Secondly, it would provide that regulations under clause 5 should be made by so-called super-affirmative procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 5(3)(a) gives the board of the Inland Revenue the power to make regulations to suit new circumstances that may arise in future. The current wording of the paragraph is the normal way to ensure that regulation-making powers conferred in primary legislation are not so narrow that they allow no scope for changing circumstances. The wording is often used in both tax and social security legislation. Opposition Members try—most engagingly in the case of the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar—but they cannot get away from the fact that the same procedure was used extensively by the previous Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 5(3)(b) provides a power for regulations to be made following negative resolution procedure in both Houses of Parliament. That is the normal process in the tax system. Indeed, it is more usual for tax regulations to be laid only before this House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may have missed something, but I thought that the Minister said that the clause provided for a negative resolution in both Houses of Parliament. Line 43 on page 3 of the Bill says "a resolution of either House", although amendment No. 41 proposed that it should be considered by both Houses of Parliament. If the Minister will agree to amendment No. 41, I shall be delighted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, "either House" means that either House may annul, because both Houses will have the opportunity to do so. That is clearly set out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Social security legislation also frequently provides for regulations to be made by negative resolution procedure. Therefore, the amendment is unnecessary. I assume that it was prompted by hon. Members' legitimate concern to ensure that all regulations made under clause 5 will be subject to proper scrutiny. I hope that I can reassure them on that point. As many Committee members will know, it is common practice for the Inland Revenue to consult
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0457">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>179</span>
widely before making new regulations, especially relating to PAYE. In this instance, Committee members and hon. Members in the other place are happy for it to draft regulations that govern payment of tax credits by employers. The drafts have also been circulated to several interested parties, and will shortly be made available to a much wider audience for comment. Of course, that is the normal process of consultation on Inland Revenue regulations and the negative resolution procedure is a tried and tested system for introducing secondary legislation. I hope that I have reassured the Committee about the Government's intentions, but if the amendment is pressed to a vote, I urge the Committee to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are soothed but not reassured by the hon. Lady. I believe that this is a Henry VIII Bill in more than one way. It is certainly the Government's intention to move working families tax credit further and further up the income scale, so that if Henry VIII were still alive, he might possibly benefit under the Bill—and woe betide anyone who tried to take the form away from him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After consultation with my hon. Friends and to ensure that the hon. Member for Bury, South has the opportunity to become a Minister at some stage, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 39, in page 3, line 44, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(3A) The Board shall, in consultation with employers who are likely to be paying a tax credit to employees when this section comes into force, publish a Code of Conduct for such employers by 6th April 2000.'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment was tabled on the off-chance that the Committee had not agreed to previous amendments. As it turns out, they were not agreed to and the amendment, which would require the Inland Revenue to issue a code of conduct for employers, is therefore necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The code of conduct would be devised after extensive consultation with the employers who will have to administer the benefit, but a code of conduct it would nevertheless be. It would deal with the Opposition's concerns, especially those about stigma and confidentiality. The Government did not accept our amendment that would require employers to take reasonable precautions to safeguard the confidentiality of employees. The next best thing would be to include that requirement in a code of conduct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The gist of the amendment is that the Government will produce a code of conduct in consultation with employers, which will help to maintain confidentiality in the administration of the benefit and to reduce stigma, and it should go some way towards remedying the Bill's fundamental flaws.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To misquote Clint Eastwood, I am going to make the hon. Gentleman's day. The Inland Revenue has already begun work on a code of practice, which it will publish in October 1999. It will consult representatives of employer groups while the code is being drafted. It will also produce a code for applicants,
	<span class='label label-info column'>180</span>
which will be published in October 1999. Given that good news, I have absolutely no doubt that the hon. Gentleman will have the good grace to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Financial Secretary has made my day. In view of her commitment, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Webb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 16, in page 3, leave out line 45 and add—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(4) This section shall not come into force until the Chancellor of the Exchequer has laid before both Houses of Parliament a statement that he is satisfied that employers are likely to be in a position to comply with their obligations under this Act.'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment would place a duty on the Chancellor of the Exchequer to lay
	<br><blockquote><p>"before both Houses of Parliament a statement".</p></blockquote>
that employers are ready to implement the WFTC before it is implemented. I notice that the Bill's cover page includes a statement from the Chancellor about the Bill's consistency with the European convention on human rights, and I want him to make a similar statement about the fact that employers are ready to implement the WFTC's introduction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why is that important? The WFTC will deliver, I believe, £5 billion to lower-paid working families. How much of that will come through the pay-packet? It is difficult to give a precise figure but I notice that the Inland Revenue's regulatory impact assessment assumes that approximately two thirds of employers will opt for payment through the pay-packet. We can exclude the self-employed from the calculation, but all lone parents will be obliged to receive the credit through the pay-packet. To take a fair stab at a figure, I would guess that about £3 billion—a huge sum—will be received through the pay-packet. It is therefore vital that that money is delivered effectively and efficiently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We might estimate that only 1 per cent. of firms will not be ready and able to administer the WFTC on time—but 1 per cent. of £3 billion is £30 million. If 1 per cent. of employers are not ready in April 2000, £30 million will not reach the pockets of needy lower-income families. That calculation assumes a problem rate of only 1 per cent., but a rather large proportion of employees who will be covered will be working for small firms, and the 1 per cent. figure might therefore be a modest assumption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What reasons are there to think that firms will not be ready? Committee members have heard that jewellers in Bromsgrove and small businesses in Beckenham do not know that the reform is coming—and no one in Northavon has mentioned it to me. Small businesses will have many proposals to cope with, including the minimum wage, which I support—in doing so, I part company for once with Conservative Members. They will also have to deal with the new fairness at work legislation and the fact that the WFTC will be introduced only three months after the millennium bug is due to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0458">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>181</span>
surface. However, we are discussing placing on small businesses an obligation to deliver £3 billion to low-income families.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why do we want the Chancellor to make a statement? Because it would acknowledge personal ownership and responsibility of this "project". The Chancellor introduced the working families tax credit by force of personality. His fingerprints are all over it. There is not much argument; it is part of a creed. The Financial Secretary said that there is a difference in political philosophy. We have not evidence but assertion. A cost of £100 million will be placed on business on the back of the Chancellor's hunch.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chancellor—I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) will back me on this—needs to admit ownership of, and take responsibility for, this project. If employers do not deliver and the system is the shambles that we fear it will be, the Chancellor should be responsible. Nothing would make that clearer than the Chancellor placing before Parliament a statement in which he says that he believes that employers are ready. If I were Chancellor of the Exchequer—as one day I hope to be—and had to lay a personal statement before the House saying that, in my judgment, employers are ready, I would be sure that they were. A statement would give the Treasury an extra impetus to ensure that firms know about the measure—when it begins and what it involves—make it as easy as possible for it to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Financial Secretary, in her response to this simple amendment, will advise us what steps have been taken to ensure that employers are ready and that the 500,000 firms that are to deliver the credit will be able to put their payroll systems in place. Although I do not support this use of public money, I want the Bill to work. I want to be confident that employees will be able to get the money to vulnerable people. I have grave doubts about their ability to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to make a brief contribution. I agree with much that the hon. Member for Northavon said. The proposal is modest. The Chancellor of the Exchequer should make a statement. His fortunes are held together by the Bill, which makes me, as a Conservative, very happy because I do not think that it will be regarded as a great triumph. Labour Members will rue the day that they introduced it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I disagree with the hon. Gentleman in one respect—his ambition to become Chancellor. In a previous debate, he said that he tended to agree with the last person who has spoken to him. That is not a prerequisite for becoming Chancellor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Member for Northavon went on to say that that explained why he was a member of the Liberal Democrat party.
	<br><blockquote><p>The amendment would delay the introduction of clause 5 "until the Chancellor of the Exchequer has laid before both Houses of Parliament a statement that he is satisfied that employers are likely to be in a position to comply with their obligations under"</p></blockquote>
the Bill. The amendment is unnecessary. The Chancellor would not have proposed the payment of tax credits by employees if he had not been satisfied that they would
	<span class='label label-info column'>182</span>
be able to comply with their obligations. We are doing everything that we can to ensure that employers are in a position to fulfil their new duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Northavon overestimates what we are asking employers to do. They will not have to assess applications for tax credit. The Inland Revenue will do that. It will tell employers when to start paying the credits, how much to pay and when to stop. Employers will be paying tax credits as well as carrying out their normal PAYE duties, with which they are, of course, familiar, and will account to the Revenue for tax credits paid, in the same way as they send in annual returns for PAYE tax deducted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In case there could have been any doubt about employers' ability to cope with their new obligations, we have, properly and rightly, involved employer representatives in the design of the scheme and we are grateful to them. This debate provides me with the opportunity to thank them for the many valuable suggestions on the detailed aspects of the system. The consultations with representative bodies will continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, in the run-up to April 2000 a targeted publicity campaign will ensure that employers know exactly what they have to do. There will be a helpline for employers and the Inland Revenue will provide information, easy-to-use guidance and educational material to help employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a trusting soul—but not as trusting as the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar—and I presume that the hon. Member for Northavon tabled the amendment to probe the Government so that we put on the record our intentions on the targeted publicity campaign. Having provided that information, I have no doubt that the hon. Member for Northavon will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Webb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. lady used the word "delay". She said that I sought to delay implementation until the statement had been placed before the House. If employers are ready, requiring the Chancellor to make a statement that they are ready will not delay implementation. It would not take the Chancellor long to make a statement, nor would it hold up implementation. It would cause delay only if employers were not ready. Implementation will either be delayed because employers are not ready, in which case it should be delayed, or it will not be delayed. I am puzzled at the Minister's use of "delay".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a modest amendment and would give the Chancellor an impetus. He has not been party to our deliberations, he did not contribute to the Second Reading debate and we do not expect him to contribute on the Third Reading, so he has been rather distanced from the process and from scrutiny of the Bill, although I do not doubt that he has read my contributions with interest. We require this personal ownership by the Chancellor and I am unable to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, amendment No. 47 in page 3, line 45, at end inset
	<br><blockquote><p>'except in the case of employers who employ fewer than 21 people when it shall come into force on 6th April 2002.'.</p></blockquote>
This amendment would not have been necessary had earlier Opposition amendments been accepted. We have set out in detail our concerns about the burden that the working families tax credit will impose on small employers. The regulatory impact assessment calculated that it would place £100 million of extra costs on business, of which £49 million will apply to employers with fewer than 100 employees and £35 million to employers with fewer than 10. The amendment would delay the implementation of the benefit administration system until small employers had had time to make sure that their systems were in place, which would make it easier for them to cope with the administration. There is also a large upfront figure of £43 million for the one-off set-up costs in preparing systems for the new benefit administration system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The charity TaxAid, which provides free tax advice to people in financial need, says that a delay until 2002 is essential because it will
	<br><blockquote><p>"give small firms more time to prepare themselves for the change, and allow many practical difficulties to be ironed out before smaller firms are brought within its scope."</p></blockquote>
TaxAid's argument is that difficulties will inevitably arise in the introduction of such a system and that it is better to spot them and to hinder the work of larger companies rather than smaller companies, which may be less well equipped to deal with them. Let us put the system in place for larger companies in the first instance, get the problems ironed out and then, two years down the line, apply it to smaller companies. In the meantime, employees working for companies with fewer than 21 employees, who are entitled to the benefit, will be able to have it paid direct by the Inland Revenue, in the way that couples can elect to be paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
TaxAid goes on to say that if the delay is implemented:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We believe that this will help to ensure that when the scheme is extended to smaller firms it will be more 'user friendly' and therefore less likely to be resented by smaller employers or the subject of abuse."</p></blockquote>
The Government must agree that they do not want the system to be resented by smaller employers; they want it to function smoothly. This is a genuinely helpful
	<span class='label label-info column'>184</span>
amendment to assist the Government in getting the system accepted by the hundreds of thousands of smaller employers who will have to implement it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I echo the thoughts of my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton when he said that this is a genuinely helpful amendment. Indeed it is. We are here on this occasion not only to help small businesses but to help the Government and the implementation of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members who have had an opportunity to read carefully the report of our deliberation on Tuesday will have read the many contributions explaining why small firms are at a disadvantage and how costs peculiarly hit them harder than larger undertakings and I do not intend to repeat those arguments. I want to make two fresh and distinct points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first relates to phasing. The amendment would give the Government an opportunity to phase the measure in, applying it first to businesses that are more likely to be able to cope with this new form of paying benefit than smaller firms. That would allow smoother implementation and give small firms breathing space to prepare for the new system. It would also ensure that the lessons learnt from the implementation by larger firms can be passed on to smaller firms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point is giving much concern to the Public Accounts Committee. You will no doubt recall, Mrs. Roe, the warning that was issued to the Inland Revenue by the Comptroller because of concerns that in four instances the Inland Revenue computer is not millennium compliant. Already there are signs of problems. I have a similar concern. If we are to implement the Bill a few months after trying to sort out those four problems, we are simply asking for trouble. The Government would be wise to accept the amendment, because it will allow them to phase in the Bill and will give them a necessary breathing space to ensure a smooth transition, once the Inland Revenue has dealt with all the problems that it faces regarding millennium compliance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a helpful amendment and I am confident that he Financial Secretary will respond in the spirit in which it is moved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I keep saying, the hon. Gentleman is very engaging. When one looks at him, a wonderful phrase springs to mind. What he is really saying to the Government is, "I am from the Opposition; I am here to help." But on this occasion I shall resist his banter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested by the debate, because the hon. Gentleman then bit his tongue when the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton referred to the Bill as "this new tax system". Clearly my remarks are getting through to Labour Members, so I am grateful that they tabled the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to defer until April 2002 the payment of tax credits by employers who employ fewer than 21 people, because Opposition Members believe that they will need two years more than others to prepare for the new system. Perhaps I may give the Committee, some reassurance, as I did in the earlier debate. All employers will be given ample guidance by the Revenue before April
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0460">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>185</span>
2000, so that they understand what the payment of taxcredits will mean for them. As well as a targeted publicity campaign, when small firms will be much in our minds, there will be an employer helpline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To defer payment through the payroll for employees of smaller companies would be unfair. All employees should have a right to tax credits with their pay. It would be wrong to make some wait a further two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is unnecessary and would have undesirable results for employers. Therefore, I urge the Committee to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The amendment has two purposes. First, it aims to resolve a slight ambiguity in the wording of the clause, by inserting into clause 8(1), the phrase,
	<br><blockquote><p>"both to repay such amount as is fraudulently or negligently so claimed and".</p></blockquote>
In other words, any money that is fraudulently claimed will be repaid. In addition, the amendment would impose a penalty, which would be the difference between the amount of the tax credit to which the claimant was entitled and the amount to which the claim relates. The wording of the clause is ambiguous on whether a penalty is imposed in addition to the common law requirement to repay money that has been fraudulently claimed, or whether the penalty itself is the only repayment of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>186</span>
fraudulently claimed money. In that regard, the amendment is probing. It allows the Government to clarify their intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the amendment aims to put on record the Opposition's concern about fraud. A number of hon. Members raised the issue on Second Reading and it has been alluded to during the Committee. The best contribution came from the right hon. Member for Birkenhead, who said on Second Reading:
	<br><blockquote><p>"fraud is generally accepted to account for about 15 per cent. of the American equivalent of working families tax credit. If the same happens here, we will face a fraud bill of £750 million."</p></blockquote>
That is £750 million of fraud to be added to the £100 million of burdens on business, according to the regulatory impact assessment. The right hon. Member for Birkenhead continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In Committee, we shall need to consider carefully how much more effectively the Treasury will protect taxpayers' money than the DSS—sadly—has in the past."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 26 January 1999; Vol. 324, c. 168.]</p></blockquote>
It is a pity that, after such a heavy hint, the Government did not feel it appropriate to put the right hon. Member for Birkenhead on the Committee, so that he could consider carefully how to protect WFTC from fraud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fraud is a problem not only in America but in Canada, where the system was even more similar to WFTC. Fraud was so prevalent in Canada that the system was scrapped after only five years of implementation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I should like to refer to the Social Security Committee report on family credit fraud—document HC 217. Although the statistics that were used were small and therefore not significant, the pilot study shows 32 instances of proven fraud in the administration of family credit and a further 50 instances of high suspicion of fraud. That is a 10 per cent. fraud rate and a 16 per cent. high suspicion of fraud rate. Family credit is widely regarded as well administered and does not suffer from the inherent difficulties of the WFTC system, yet the Government want to introduce a system that has a proven track record of fraud elsewhere in the world. Therefore, it is likely that fraud will become more of a problem. Will the Financial Secretary explain why she believes that the new system will be less fraudulent than that which already exists?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me start off on a good note in replying to the hon. Gentleman: we welcome the intention behind the amendment. However, I am unable to support it because it duplicates an existing provision in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister explain?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I shall explain. As I was going to say before that interruption—a courteous interruption, but one from a sedentary position—I do not think that the hon. Gentleman has read the Bill with care. [HON. MEMBERS: "Withdraw."] Sometimes, my discourtesy almost amazes me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would enable the Inland Revenue to collect an overpayment of tax credit from someone who claimed it fraudulently or negligently. It is proposed that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0461">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>187</span>
the amendment should be inserted in the clause that provides for a penalty to be charged on such a person. I understand what motivated the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton to table such an amendment, and I am sure that the whole Committee is united in the aim to do everything we can to combat fraud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right to collect an overpayment of tax credit when the overpayment has arisen from a misrepresentation, whether fraudulent or otherwise, is contained in section 71 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 and section 69 of the Social Security Administration (Northern Ireland) Act 1992. Those sections will apply to tax credits, with the modifications set out in schedule 2 part IV of the Bill. The Government fully intend that those who claim too much tax credit as a result of misrepresenting their circumstances should pay back what they falsely claimed. The Bill provides for that, so the amendment is unnecessary, although I am grateful to the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton for tabling it because it has given me the opportunity to draw attention to that part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given that, in two separate reports, the Social Security Committee indicated how the working families tax credit would be more liable to fraud, and given experience in America and Canada, will the Minister explain what additional measures the Government have introduced to ensure that fraud is not more prevalent in working families tax credit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My remarks referred to additional powers, not to those that relate only to family credit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that we have both the powers in the Bill—the very powers that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is very helpful. Now, it is clear that the clause provides for a penalty in addition to the requirement to repay the money owed, and that there is a genuine deterrent against misclaiming working families tax credit. If there were only a requirement to repay the money, there would be no downside to submitting a fraudulent claim, but it is now clear from clause 8 that there is a penalty, albeit a penalty equal to the amount of

fraudulently claimed working families tax credit. In view of that assurance, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>PERSONS QUALIFYING FOR DISABLED PERSON'S TAX CREDIT</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Webb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This clause relates to persons qualifying for disabled person's tax credit. Significantly, our discussions have paid insufficient attention to the disabled person's tax credit, which we have tended to bracket together with WFTC. If those who cheer whenever the Chancellor says, "And we've introduced a disabled person's tax credit," knew how minor and insignificant it is, they might think again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister tell us how many people will qualify for disabled person's tax credit compared to the disability working allowance? Can she provide an estimate not merely for the first year of implementation, but for subsequent years, when the credit will have had time to bed down?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During my time in social research, it became clear that the disability working allowance was a complete flop. I knew social researchers who were able, because the allowance was negligible, to conduct a 100 per cent. survey of those who received it. I hope that the disabled person's tax credit will not suffer the same fate, but I suspect that, although it sounds good, it will deliver relatively little. Therefore, the Minister should give concrete estimates of the numbers involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am slightly disappointed by the hon. Gentleman's remarks. I am delighted to introduce clause 13, which will enable more people with short-term illnesses and disabilities to benefit from in-work support. The disabled person's tax credit replaces and enhances the current disability working allowance—a benefit that has to a great extent failed to encourage people with an illness or a disability to enter the work force, rather than to rely on out-of-work benefits. Take-up has been only a quarter of the level that was forecast when it was introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The disabled person' tax credit has a lower taper, higher thresholds and will provide improved help with child care costs. We hope that more people with illnesses or disabilities will see the benefits and greater rewards of work, and we shall do all that we can to help them make the transition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The credit will provide a further £30 million for in-work support. I would have thought that such a sum would have received a rather warmer welcome from the hon. Gentleman. We anticipate that 6,000 more people will be able to take up the credit—a not inconsiderable figure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Webb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is pathetic!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A condition of the disability working allowance is that claimants must be in receipt of one of a range of benefits when they claim, or during the 56 days prior to claiming.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Webb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For clarity, is the 6,000 the extra number created by the provisions in clause 13—the extension from 56 to 182 days—or the global total of extra recipients?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to seek assurance on the clause, under which arrangements would be made for the necessary money to be paid out to various bodies. Will local authorities be covered by the clause if they incur extra costs? I know that the Financial Secretary does not expect the number of child minders to increase but, should that happen, local authorities will incur extra costs because they have to register and inspect child minders. If central Government are not prepared to ensure that local authorities get the extra money, either through ring-fenced grant or standard spending assessments, those authorities will be forced to skimp on the provision of inspectors and inspections, which could result in scandals similar to those that have already occurred in that sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a similar point, the Bill does not provide for the passporting of benefits that previously applied to family credit. The Government have not decided whether to allow the same passport rights to apply to the working family tax credit. Is that still under consideration?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You have a puzzled Minister before you, Mrs. Roe. Clearly, you want me to be in order, but clause 15 is about a "sink of italics". It assists the drafting of the

Its sole purpose is to avoid the need to italicise parts of the Bill that will lead to expenditure by the board, or to increased payments out of votes or into the Consolidated Fund under other Acts. The clause puts all the italics in one place. We will have an opportunity to discuss the point raised by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton when we debate a later clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Beckenham was not precisely in order, although I am not trying to usurp your function, Mrs. Roe. She made the same point when we discussed eligibility for child care.

I have made it clear that we do not expect anything of that sort to happen. Opposition Members must return to the reality of how people conduct their childcare arrangements.

The new clause is a technical provision to deal with the transfer of certain contracts supplying a range of services throughout the Department of Social Security, including the family credit unit. They include information technology service contracts, which are at present operated in the Department by the Information Technology Services Agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After the introduction of working families tax credit, the new tax credit office will need to rely on services provided by those contracts. The new clause simply allows the new tax credit unit to access the benefits of the contracts, while the contracts themselves will remain under the management of the Department of Social Security.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause is being added to the Bill as a result of detailed examination of the contracts involved in the transfer of functions. A similar provision was included in the Bill to transfer the Contributions Agency.

	<p>"Recipients of a tax credit shall be entitled to the benefits to which claimants of family credit and disability working allowance were entitled under the National Health Service (Travelling Expenses and Remission of Charges) Regulations 1998 as they had effect immediately prior to the coming into force of this Act.".—[	<i>Mr. Webb.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Webb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, that the clause be read a Second time. This gives me the opportunity to reflect on the passported benefits on which the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton touched. It is a concern that we share. The more that I have reflected on those benefits, the more concerned I have become. I want to probe the Minister on two passported benefits in relation to working families tax credit. First, on NHS benefits, which cover free prescription charges, eye tests, dental work, wigs and fabric supports, we want the Government to clarify whether they intend that recipients of working families tax credit will be entitled to those benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton was interested in the fact that, at present, family credit recipients are entitled to social fund grants, including funeral and maternity grants. The WFTC will extend to higher rate taxpayers. Either recipients of the WFTC, including those on very modest incomes, are about to be
	<span class='label label-info column'>192</span>
denied funeral grants, or higher rate taxpayers are about to start getting funeral grants. I hope that the new clause, which probes that question, encourages the Government to give their views.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Julian Brazier 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Canterbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I echo the hon. Gentleman's comments and I share his concerns. The fact that the benefit system has de facto been extended so far up the income scale is complete and utter nonsense. If all the benefits that he mentioned will apply to everyone who is eligible for WFTC, we will face an horrendous bill, but if none of the benefits will apply to anyone who is eligible for WFTC, there will be hardship and major disincentives to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot seriously want to tell the parents in a low-income family, who have three or four children who need to be supported, that they cannot get their children's teeth fixed for free, a funeral grant, free school meals or any other similar benefit, and tell the members of the family who live next door but who are on the dole that they can get those benefits. That would send the worst message. The problem must be dealt with but, frankly, the Government have not explained their intentions I look forward to the Minister's reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government face a dilemma. We are concerned that entitlement will move further up the economic scale and that, to cover those costs, people at the lower end of the scale will be deprived. DWA and family credit have been useful mechanisms for passporting benefits, and they involve the idea of claiming benefits automatically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In its meetings with the Government, the Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation did not get the assurances it was seeking on eye tests and prescription. It would be ironic if the Government's efforts to ensure that people higher up the income scale received the WFTC meant that those at the lower end were deprived. The Government made a great play of saying that people would be better off, but if they made some people better off by taking away free prescriptions and eye tests from those at the lower end of the scale, those people would be worse off. The Minister talked at length earlier about the £1.5 billion figure. Will some of that sum be used for the passported benefits?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new Clause would continue to passport tax credit recipients and entitle them to free prescriptions. It would ensure that recipients of tax credits continue to be entitled to free prescriptions, in the way that recipients of family credit and DWA are currently entitled to them. The hon. Members for Northavon and for Brentwood and Ongar rightly said that this matter involves the question of passporting, which I said we would discuss.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department of Health is responsible for the low income scheme that provides help with, for example, free prescriptions and eye tests. The Government made it clear that we will ensure that the help that is provided by the NHS low income scheme will continue to go to those who need it most. I assure the Committee that that is our intention.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0464">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>193</span>
However, it would be inappropriate for legislation governing tax credits, for which the Inland Revenue is responsible, to prescribe policy for which the Department of Health is responsible. It is particularly inappropriate to lock Department of Health Ministers into a policy through primary legislation, when the details of the current policy on the low income scheme are determined by secondary legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am saying clearly, and I shall repeat it because it is important, that the Department of Health is responsible for the low income scheme. The Government have made it clear that the help given under the NHS low income scheme continues to go to those who need it most.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with Treasury legislation governing tax credits for which the Inland Revenue is responsible, and it would be inappropriate to lock Department of Health Ministers into a policy through primary legislation, when the details of current policy on the low income scheme are determined by secondary legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the Financial Secretary's point about it being inappropriate to lock other Ministries in, one of the few positive things about family credit, which few people have criticised as much as I have, was that it brought the range of benefits from many different Departments—even the Department for Education and Employment, with free school meals and the rest—under a single umbrella, so that they could be seen as a whole. Part of the Financial Secretary's manifesto was that the Government would look at the benefit system coherently as a whole. The statement that she has just made about this being the wrong place to do it illustrates that the Bill is fragmenting the benefit system, making it even more difficult to make it work coherently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Committee will forgive me for returning to this point. I understand what the hon.

Can the Financial Secretary give an indication of the genuineness of her statement by saying whether the
	<span class='label label-info column'>194</span>
Government have included in the accounts a figure for the cost of passporting the benefits, as I requested under clause 15?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Webb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am more happy to give way to the Financial Secretary is she wishes to respond to that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am puzzled by the response that we have had. My understanding is that at present family credit is a passport to free prescriptions, but working families tax credit will not be a passport; the low income scheme, which applies to people with low incomes whether they are on benefits or not, will be the mechanism used to deliver passported benefits only to low-income recipients. If that is correct, take-up issues arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The concern is not just about working families tax credit, but about the disabled person's tax credit. The Government are even reluctant to give an assurance on that. I can understand the problems with regard to working families tax credit, but to hold the line on the disabled person's tax credit seems a little strange.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Webb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's intervention was well made. The issue of free prescriptions will be particularly acute for disabled person's tax credit recipients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a nasty feeling that, because the Government have got themselves into a mess by extending the credit so far up the income scale, they will now mess up free prescriptions for low-paid people and create further bureaucracy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Kirkbride</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So that I am clear, are we not also talking about free school meals? I would be concerned about that, as I receive many letters on the subject in my post bag. I should be grateful if the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Webb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When family credit was introduced in 1988 to replace family income supplement, free school meal entitlement was removed and family credit—a cash payment—put in its place.

	<br><blockquote><p>"Any subordinate legislation made under any of the provisions mentioned in Part I of this Schedule or this Part."</p></blockquote>
It is unfair for readers of legislation to have to research such provisions. They should be set out in schedules to the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always happy to help the Committee if I can. This is a catch-all provision ensuring that if provisions in subordinate legislation confer a function, those functions will be transferred to the board. It will cover situations where the regulations specify that decisions are to be resolved by the Secretary of State. Without that provision, such functions—in so far as they related to the tax credit—would remain with the Secretary of State. Clearly, that is undesirable, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be satisfied and will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find that baffling. Do the Government not know what the provisions are?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By its very nature, it is a catch-all provision. Some provisions may have to be dealt with in such a way. I am slightly surprised by the hon. Gentleman, who I understand is very familiar with the Bill from close reading. He will know that such a provision is very common.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am worried by this point as it demonstrates the problem of the proliferation of secondary legislation. People in this country are assumed to be fully cognisant of all the laws that they are expected to obey. The Government, however, say that they are not cognisant of the laws that apply in this case. It is unacceptable for the Government to introduce Bills with the provision that any other piece of legislation—which they cannot find at the moment, but which may exist somewhere—will also transfer. Every subject of this country is expected to know the laws and obey them. That may be a legal fiction, but the Financial Secretary has demonstrated that our secondary legislation—any practitioner outside this House will agree—has become so complicated that even the Government cannot set out in a schedule to a Bill the provisions of secondary legislation to which it applies. That is a disgrace.

In view of the pressure of time, however, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Schedule 2 agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Schedules 3 to 6 agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Chairman do report the Bill, as amended, to the House.</p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>196</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I take this opportunity, Mrs. Roe, on behalf of the Government, and indeed the whole Committee, to thank you and your co-Chairman, Mrs. Dunwoody, for the courteous and firm way in which you have conducted our proceedings?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All members of the Committee will agree that this is an important Bill, and hon. Members have made their contributions with clarity and vigour. The debate has been conducted in an open and courteous way, which has occasioned some hilarity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I associate myself with the Financial Secretary's words? Our deliberations began a few weeks ago and we have gently ambled through the fictional county of Barchester, through Ambridge and "Shakespeare in Love", touching briefly on hymns ancient and modern, all to the gentle, lilting tune of "Edelweiss".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that we have not been here for weeks is a great tribute to you, Mrs. Roe, and your co-Chairman, Mrs. Dunwoody, who had occasion to tick hon. Members off for being too flowery in their praise of those in the Chair. One of the joys of being a Member of Parliament is that, when we see a friend in the Chair, we can heap praise on them, beyond the point of embarrassment. It is great to see a mate squirm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a good-natured debate on an important Bill. The Opposition have done their best to table amendments to improve it. To our regret, with the exception of a single amendment, the Government have not seen fit to respond.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Two.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Two typographical amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Webb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to associate myself with the comments that have been made by the Financial Secretary and the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar. I have enjoyed taking part in the Committee, the good-natured way in which it has been conducted and the light touch with which you, Mrs. Roe, have steered us effectively to our conclusion. It would have been nice to feel that we had seen evidence in the past few weeks of our contentions, but perhaps that is yet to come.

The triumphant moment was the addition of that apostrophe. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton will be thanked down the ages for ensuring that it is present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank hon. Members, on behalf of Mrs. Dunwoody and myself, for their kind remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Bill, as amended, to be reported.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Committee rose at twenty-nine minutes past Eleven o'clock.</i></p>
