</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Jacqui Lait 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beckenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had just risen to my feet when you adjourned the Committee, Mr. Malins. We had an exhaustive discussion this morning, but that will not stop me from adding my might to the general fund of human happiness on the subject before us. I wish to concentrate on a matter which my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies) mentioned, but which was not explored in as much detail as it merits. The clause attacks the national insurance principle and the purpose of our amendments is to ameliorate that. We shall vote against the clause in an attempt to reinstate the positive principle of national insurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>860</span>
I am sure that all Committee members know from conversations with pensioners and disabled people that their instinct—they do not articulate it—is that the national insurance deductions from their earnings have been tucked away in the Benefits Agency or the Department of Social Security. They believe that a capital sum, with interest added, accumulates during their working lives and that it is theirs to call on in time of need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The original idea of national insurance was first class, but since it was introduced the Government have paid out money as soon as it comes in and the sum of money tucked away in the Treasury is a mirage. People are attached to the national insurance principle and the Government's proposal for incapacity benefit agitates them because it breaks that principle. They believe that if they have worked and contributed through national insurance for their time of need, they have a right to receive benefit if they become incapacitated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sadly, the Government are breaking that principle for the group that we have highlighted. We have discussed women who make contributions while they work, but stop working to bring up their children and later return to work. They may return to low-paid jobs because that fits in with the family pattern. They may not pay national insurance contributions because their incomes are so low, but if they were hit by crippling incapacity they would be unable to claim incapacity benefit under the Government's proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand from the Equal Opportunities Commission that 2 million women may not meet the incapacity criteria, thank goodness, but all of the other criteria that I mentioned. If things went disastrously wrong, a large demand would result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have discussed low earners, who may have had a good contributions record for many years. Many people—especially men over the age of 50—are, unfortunately, vulnerable to early retirement, largely because of changes in technology. That fact is often dressed up in other ways, but sometimes such people are simply made unemployed by their company. It is hard for them to get a job with an income similar to their previous income, and they may become a low earner for two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we grow older, the chances of our becoming incapacitated are higher, although they are still low. People who believe that they are insured through their national insurance contributions will have no access to incapacity benefit. The hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel) discussed the problems facing people with illnesses such as multiple sclerosis. Such people may not be able to build up the contributions record that they need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to bear in mind the interests of carers who do not receive invalid care allowance on the ground that it might affect the income of the person for whom they care. The Government may have already decided to look kindly on such people. If so, I hope that the Minister will confirm that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are all concerned about the circumstances that have led to increasing numbers of people claiming incapacity benefit. Many Committee members will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0943">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>861</span>
remember the huge rise in the number of people who claimed invalidity benefit. The Conservative Government rightly said that that benefit needed to be re-examined. Committee members will remember constituents who came to our surgeries and said, "I have been made redundant by my company and the human resources people have told me to claim invalidity benefit." Other constituents said, "The Benefits Agency staff told me to claim invalidity benefit." For those reasons, incapacity benefit and a much more stringent medical test, the all-work test, were introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government said that we should be more positive about the all-work test, which they renamed the personal capability assessment. They believe that the personal capability assessment will help people who are able to get back into work to do so. However, I do not understand why they need to curb IB, unless that proposal is Treasury driven. If the Government believe that the assessments will help people who can get back into work to do so, they should have the courage of their convictions and say, "Anyone who needs IB should be able to claim it." They should return to the insurance principle in which the British people have a fundamental and deep belief. The clause challenges that principle, and our amendments seek to alleviate the clause's effects in a small way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government cannot say, with their hand on their heart, that the personal capability assessment can deal with the possibility of everyone's returning to work, the only conclusion that one can come to is that the Treasury is insisting that the Government should save money. Savings are being made in the most heartless and thoughtless way. Vulnerable groups who believe that they have insured for the worst may find that they do not have that insurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Hugh Bayley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has been quite a long debate—more than two and a half hours. I want to give the full response that hon. Members deserve. I cannot promise to respond to each point because if I were to do so I would still be on my feet at the end of the sitting, which no Committee member would want. I will try to respond to all the substantive points—I believe that there are 18 of them—and to comment directly on the nature of the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten), who opened the debate, quoted my right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) from Second Reading. My right hon. Friend is a long-standing close personal friend—I knew him before he became a Member of Parliament, when he worked for the Child Poverty Action Group. I should pay tribute to him by quoting something else that he said on Second Reading:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is much in the Bill that Labour Members will want to support, so I will be very surprised if the enticement offered by the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel) has any effect other than to drive us together."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 23 February 1999; Vol. 326, c. 246.]</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>862</span>
My right hon. Friend mentioned various proposals, which Labour Members on this Committee warmly support, including the decision to passport severely disabled young people who have never had the opportunity to work under severe disablement allowance onto incapacity benefit, and the extension of the disability living allowance higher rate mobility component to children aged three and four. That has been welcomed by all of the disability groups. My right hon. Friend also mentioned the single gateway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that all Committee members will recognise that the Bill is a welfare reform package to encourage work and to improve support for the most severely disabled people—especially the poorest of them—for whom work is not an option.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Rendel 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned his right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead's comment about me. My hon. Friend the Member for Winchester has reminded me that the right hon. Member for Birkenhead also said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel) was right to say that he was puzzled by the Prime Minister saying that he wanted to root out the something-for-nothing society."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 23 February 1999; vol. 326, c. 247.]</p></blockquote>
The right hon. Member for Birkenhead therefore has some good things to say about me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that my right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead, while supporting the Government's welfare reform strategy and the direction taken in the Bill—it would be surprising if he were not supportive, as he was one of the Ministers responsible—also made some criticisms, of which we are all aware. I remind hon. Members of what my right hon. Friend wrote about disability benefits in 	<i>The Sunday Times,</i> on 2 August 1998:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Spending on disability benefit is rising fast. A new system that does not have the incentive built in to move from unemployment to long-term sickness is urgently required. And some of the savings here should be used to support carers and those with disabilities."</p></blockquote>
That is reflected in our welfare reform strategy. We are making changes that will direct resources for long-term sick and disabled people more effectively, in order to provide opportunities to work for those who are able to do so. Those resources will increase over the lifetime of the Parliament. As the Committee is aware, more than 1 million people on long-term sickness and disability benefit say that, given the right support and opportunities, they would rather work. At the same time, we should provide support for those whose disabilities are such that they cannot work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mark Oaten 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Winchester)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There seems to be a fundamental difference. The Government's initiatives to get disabled people back to work involve pilots that might not take place nationally until 2003, but the cuts and changes to the benefits system affect everyone and take effect straight away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree. A substantial number of young people on the new deal are disabled. I would be the first to admit that we have a long way to go. There
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0944">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>863</span>
are still 1 million disabled people who aspire to work, and I do not expect a majority of them to get into work during the lifetime of this Parliament. I am realistic. However, we must do everything that we can to create opportunities and provide support for as many disabled people as possible. We must not do what the previous Government did and abandon them to a lifetime on benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Winchester acknowledged that the Government intend to protect the rights of carers in receipt of invalid care allowance to claim incapacity benefit. He asked for more detail on that. It is a technical point. The intention is to maintain the status quo for carers on ICA. ICA recipients can qualify for incapacity benefit by using credits that have been earned in the previous two tax years, in addition to contributions paid at any time before the ICA claim. No minimum of ICA credits is required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In combination with other credits, such as unemployment and sickness credits, one ICA credit in the most recent tax year will suffice. The power to make regulations to modify the first contribution condition for particular groups will be used so that former ICA recipients will simply have to pay contributions in any one tax year. They will still have to have credits worth 50 times the lower earnings limit in both the previous two tax years, and at least one credit in the most recent tax year would need to be a credit for ICA. In practice, no one receives ICA for just one week. The minimum requirement of one ICA credit has the effect of protecting people who either ceased or started to care in the most recent tax year, as well as those who have been caring throughout it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Winchester also pressed the Government to consider extending the protection that we intend to provide through regulations to people who are carers but who do not qualify for ICA. That would affect people with less onerous caring responsibilities who care for fewer than 35 hours a week. Many of those people are able to work part time and do so. Others qualify for home responsibility protection, which is open to everyone who receives child benefit. To passport a large number of people who have had the opportunity to work but who, for the good reason of bringing up their children, have rejected that opportunity, would be inappropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford depicted the Bill as a Treasury-driven, cost-cutting exercise. It is not; it is a welfare-driven reform programme. We are making changes to improve welfare for long-term sick and disabled people and, in other parts of the Bill, for other categories of people. I remind Committee members that welfare goes wider than social security. The problem with the previous Government was that they saw welfare as something that the social security budget provided for people whose welfare was compromised, perhaps because of economic decisions or the failure of the labour market to provide employment opportunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our approach to welfare is wider. We believe that joined-up government will enable health, education, social security, local authorities and the NHS to work
	<span class='label label-info column'>864</span>
together to provide opportunities for disabled people who, in the past, were simply consigned to a life on benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have in our reform programme measures that will save money. There is no doubt about that, and we say it clearly in the financial memorandum to the Bill. The clause is one of those measures. We also have measures in the Bill that will cost money. We have both kinds of measure in the Bill because they will improve the welfare of people whom we want to support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the first year in which the changes will operate—2001–02—it is estimated that the incapacity benefit changes will provide savings to the Exchequer of about £70 million or, as I am talking savings to the Exchequer, £65 million net of income tax. The severe disablement allowance changes will save in the order of £10 million in year one, but nothing in the second year. Those figures are in the financial memorandum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One must set those figures against others. In the first year, the extension of the higher rate mobility component of DLA to young children will cost an additional £15 million. The introduction of a disability income guarantee will cost an additional £60 million. The disabled person's tax credit is not part of the Bill and there is no costing in the financial memorandum, but by 2001–02 it will cost something in excess of £100 million. Therefore, the difference between the savings and the cost in year one of the welfare reform programme will amount to a net additional cost, and rightly so. Providing the support that is needed will require a net additional cost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Julian Brazier 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Canterbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister tell us—he may want to come back to this later—whether the costings that he described are based on a static or a dynamic model?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not trying to be difficult, but I am not sure what the hon. Gentleman means by the difference between a static and a dynamic model. Does he mean—he can nod if he does—that a change in the law on entitlement will change people's behaviour? If so, the figures have, as far as it is possible to make rational assumptions, taken account of that. However, that involves making predictions on the basis of changed circumstances, and we cannot look at past practice to build a model of behaviour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a practical point, does the Minister expect working families tax credit to replace IB for the low-paid mother who becomes disabled under the regime of joined-up government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The tax credit will be available to anyone who is disabled and gets into a low-paid job. That person may move into employment from a carer's benefit or a different source. The tax credit will, however, be part of a package of measures to make work pay for disabled people and to make it possible for them to move into work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to pursue the matter, but I clearly cited the example of a woman who had a good job, paid national insurance, took time off to look after her children, went back to work in a low-paid job so
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0945">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>865</span>
that she did not pay NI, and became disabled. I then applied what I understood to be the Minister's recent statements about joined-up government and the Government's idea of helping all sorts of people through a package of measures. I asked whether the Minister believed that paying working families tax credit to a woman in the circumstances that I described would cover the situation in which her IB was taken away or she was not entitled to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady cites the example of someone who has worked for more than two years in a job that pays less than the lower earnings limit. At present, such a person would not qualify for incapacity benefit, because she would not have had 50 contributions credited to her in each of the previous two tax years. If the hon. Lady thinks that she would have qualified, she is mistaken, although that is a commonly held fallacy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady should realise that there are two contribution conditions for incapacity benefit. The first is to have earned credits at some point; the second is to have credits, which may or may not have been paid for, in 50 weeks of each of the two years prior to claiming. A woman in a low-paid job earning below the lower earnings limits does not qualify now, and will not in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to pursue the point, but it returns us to a much earlier discussion, in which we cited the CPAG rights guide to non-means-tested benefits. If I may be so bold, I shall quote what the guide states—I am only going by what CPAG says. On page 237, the guide states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"You must actually have paid, in one contribution year, the appropriate class of contributions producing an earnings factor".</p></blockquote>
It does not specify which year. On the second condition, it states on page 238:
	<br><blockquote><p>"You must either have been paid or been credited with contributions producing an earnings factor … in each of the last two complete contribution years".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady makes my point. People must meet two contribution conditions: first, they must at some point have paid contributions; secondly, they must have either paid or have had credited to them contributions in 50 weeks of each of the previous two years. A woman earning below the lower earnings limit will not have paid those contributions, because she will not have paid national insurance. Nor will she have had those contributions credited to her, because she has been in work, not on benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus a woman in the circumstances that the hon. Lady describes would not qualify for incapacity at present, nor will she in future, because we do not propose to change the arrangement. That situation persisted for the whole time in which the Conservatives were in Government. I must tell the hon. Lady, and all members of the Committee who may have been confused, that that is a commonly misunderstood part of the social security regulations, which has misled some disability organisations. It is understandable that that misunderstanding has been passed on to
	<span class='label label-info column'>866</span>
some Committee members because we have all relied heavily on briefings from such organisations. However, I must make some progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rendel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister now appears to be arguing that the overall changes that the Government are making will benefit people with disabilities and help them back into work, and that some of the changes are intended to cut costs. He says that this is part of a series of measures intended to cut costs. I think that that is what he said only a moment ago—that some changes were intended to cut costs. He appeared then to argue that this is one of them. Is he in fact arguing that the clause will in some way benefit people with disabilities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, as part of a package, I believe that it will.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I disagree with the hon. Gentleman about two points. He put words into my mouth and said that some parts of the welfare reform package were intended to cut costs. Those were not my words. I have acknowledged to the Committee—it is patently obvious—that some parts of the package will result in savings for the Treasury. However, they have not been introduced because they result in savings for the Treasury; they have been introduced as part of a package that will improve welfare for disabled people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I can make a little progress, Committee members might understand the argument. They may not agree with it, but at least they will understand it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to costings, which were raised by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford. I spoke only about the first year. I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman has not asked me to speak about subsequent years. I acknowledge that savings accruing to the Treasury because of changes in the conditions for incapacity benefit—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to intervene on the Minister on errors of fact or judgment. I am taking a careful note of his remarks and I shall comment on his point about the illegitimacy of comparing short-term increases in benefit payments with much greater long-term clawbacks when he sits down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's acknowledgement that it is wrong to compare long-term and short-term gains or losses. Part of the confusion in the debate arose because some hon. Members sought to compare long-term savings achieved by changes in incapacity benefit with some of the short-term costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In fairness, one has to consider either the short-term costs in year one, which show that the Government are putting in considerably more money because more money is needed, or the long-term gains and losses of the package as a whole. The financial memorandum to the Bill shows that considerable long-term savings will accrue to the Treasury because of changes in incapacity benefit entitlement conditions. Those savings comprise some £580 million net, after income tax. That is about £700 million in all, £120 million of which would have been paid to the Treasury in income
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0946">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>867</span>
tax. As I said, that is a net saving of £580 million. As part of the Government's pensions proposals package, we are planning to provide credit for a state second pension to disabled people and carers with interrupted work records. In the long term, that policy will cost hundreds of millions of pounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Committee is to debate costs and savings, it should debate the whole picture. Dealing with only a part of the picture misleads the public and I do not want to mislead them. The Government are strongly committed to the welfare of disabled people and the long-term sick. During the current Parliament, spending on sickness and disability benefits will increase in real terms by about £1,000 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford said that the clause excludes full-time mothers from entitlement to incapacity benefit. The Committee has debated the matter. Full-time mothers are not entitled to incapacity benefit—a point made clearly by my hon. Friend the Member for Colne Valley (Kali Mountford), who speaks from considerable experience, having worked as a civil servant for the Employment Service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting what a difference an election makes and how the Conservative party's view has changed now that it is no longer in power. If Conservative Members felt that it was wrong that mothers looking after small children did not have a right to claim incapacity benefit, they had 18 years to put it right. Did they put it right? No, they did not, which explains why their argument is so threadbare.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kali Mountford 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Colne Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that my hon. Friend has raised that issue. I worked in the Department of Employment when the Conservative party was in power. A new question was introduced into the claim form asking parents about their commitments. If they declared a commitment to raising children, their benefits were often disallowed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That underlines the point, which is not down just to me or my hon. Friend, but to Conservative Ministers. On 1 March 1994, in the Standing Committee considering the Bill that became the Social Security (Incapacity for Work) Act 1994, the then Minister, Nicholas Scott, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It would be illogical to allow spells of unemployment to help build up entitlement to incapacity benefit. It is also illogical that an entitlement to incapacity benefit should arise just because a claimant satisfied the relevant contribution conditions for unemployment benefit at the start of a period of unemployment that began, as in a number of cases, many years ago."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 1 March 1994; c. 424.]</p></blockquote>
That shows the fallacy of much of the argument put forward by Opposition Members this morning. There is no change in what is happening in that regard. The hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) did not fall into that trap. He acknowledged that that was the policy before the election. He believed that it was right and that the reflection of that policy, which is being carried out by this Government, is right, although of course there are differences. Even so, I see that the hon. Gentleman agrees with me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>868</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's party won the last election and one of the reasons that our party has identified for losing some of our traditional supporters is that we moved away from traditional ideas of the family. There is nothing hypocritical about a party in opposition re-examining such matters and our new leader has made it clear that we take a different view on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I acknowledge that it is open to us, at any time, to reconsider our policies and to change them. It would also be hypocritical of me to suggest that the Labour party did not modify some of its policies to become electable. We now have policies that have made us electable and, in the fullness of time, Opposition Members will realise that a few more changes are needed. However, I am straying from the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford also expressed concern that people will qualify for incapacity benefit under the new rules only if they have paid contributions in the previous 13 months. Clause 51 is not intended to be that onerous and it is not that onerous. My hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham (Mr. Pond) asked how many weeks it would take a full-time worker on the minimum wage to meet the contribution conditions. It would take 12 weeks' work in one of the previous two tax years. People on average male earnings would achieve the amount of work in one of the previous two tax years that is necessary to qualify under the contribution conditions in less than four weeks. Someone on an average woman's full-time wage would achieve it in six weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the gap between the tax year, which ends at the beginning of April, and the benefit year, which starts in January, it means that the 12 weeks' work for someone on a minimum wage, or four weeks' work for a man on average wage, could come to an end between two and a half and three and a half years before they make their incapacity claim. They could have been on unemployment benefit for the whole of the period thereafter. People in work for 21 months before making their incapacity benefit claim should always meet the contribution conditions, at whatever point in the year they apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to restore the link between incapacity benefit and recent work. However, no one could accuse us of trying to draw it too tightly if people who have been unemployed for two years are still able to claim on the basis of paid national insurance contributions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford also raised the important issue of someone facing a progressive disability. If people's hours of work reduce because of a growing incapacity for work such that their earnings fall below the lower earnings limit and remain at that level for two years or, in some cases, slightly longer, they would of course lose entitlement to incapacity benefit. However, as I explained to the hon. Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait), they would lose entitlement under the present rules. There is no change in the rules. At present, if someone has to reduce their hours because of a progressive disability such that their wages fall below £66, they then cease to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0947">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>869</span>
pay national insurance. If they continued on that wage for a two-year period, they would not have paid national insurance for two years and would therefore no longer be eligible. In fact, under present rules, it would be earlier than a two-year period, because the credits require 50 weeks in both the previous tax years in order to qualify.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People who face that dilemma lose the right to incapacity benefit, and they would continue to lose that right under the Government's proposals. However, I say to hon. Members on both sides of the Committee that I do not believe that it is likely that many people will opt to reduce their hours to the point that they earn below the lower earnings limit, because that is lower in cash terms than the long-term rate of incapacity benefit. They would therefore be better off on benefit. For any person who does so, however, the Bill will make no difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford mentioned the problems that might be faced by somebody who has a progressive illness or fluctuating condition that means that they alternately spend some time in work and some time out of work. In the past, they faced the serious problem that if they came off the long-term rate of incapacity benefit and worked for more than eight weeks, they would find that if they needed to claim incapacity benefit again they were able to claim only at the lower rate. One of the changes that we introduced last autumn, which was widely welcomed by the lobby, was to extend the linking period from eight weeks to 52 weeks. That will make it much easier for people with fluctuating conditions to return to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham, who is a well-informed and respected member of the Select Committee on Social Security, rightly made the point that part of the increase in the number of people on incapacity benefit—I suspect that it is a substantial part—stems from the cynical use of incapacity benefit by the Conservatives to manipulate the unemployment figures. When the Conservatives came to power in 1979, unemployment stood at less than 1.1 million. The unemployment benefit claim form, which my hon. Friend the Member for Colne Valley probably remembers, had only four pages. By the mid-1980s, unemployment had rised to more than 3 million, and the unemployment benefit claim form was changed. I have a copy here. It is much longer: it has 16 pages. On page 9 it puts a number of questions for the first time. It asks
	<br><blockquote><p>"Does your health limit the work you do?",</p></blockquote>
requesting a yes or no answer. It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"What limits does your health place on the work you can do? … Are you registered with the job centre as a disabled person? … Do you have a green card? … Is anybody at the job centre giving you extra help to find work because of your health problem or disability, for example a disablement resettlement officer? … Would you like us to arrange an appointment for you to see someone at the job centre about your health problem or disability?"</p></blockquote>
I put it to members of the Committee that those questions were placed on the claim form for the first
	<span class='label label-info column'>870</span>
time in order to passport people off the unemployment benefit figures and into another benefit. The then Secretary of State for Employment, Norman Tebbit, said that if the unemployment figures at the time of the next election were as high as they then were the Conservative party would not be fit for re-election. The figures went down, for reasons that I believe to be suspect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kali Mountford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for recalling the time that I spent with the Employment Service. He may not be aware that at that time I was working for the union that was then called the Civil and Public Services Association. Members of the union who had to deal with the form had many problems with people who claimed benefit because they believed themselves to be fit, able and capable of work, only to be told by the clerk, on the instructions of the Department, that if they answered that question in a particular way the benefit would not be the appropriate benefit for them. The unemployment benefit figures were thereby kept down, and unemployed people were made to feel that they were no longer suitable for work. The clerk administering that was placed in a very difficult situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend explains exactly what was happening at that time. When incapacity benefit—or rather its predecessor, invalidity benefit—was introduced, it was intended as a benefit to compensate a person by replacing their earnings if they were forced to stop work because of a breakdown in health or progressive disability. It was not intended as an alternative form of unemployment benefit for people who were long-term unemployed but facing growing sickness. It is an income replacement benefit and is still described as such by the Department. It is there to replace income that has been lost because a person has had to give up employment owing to a breakdown in his or her health. We are seeking to return the benefit to its original purpose. It was changed in the mid-1980s, for reasons which I described, but we believe that it was wrong to change it in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) said that those who will lose entitlement to incapacity benefit as a result of this change to the contribution conditions are being abandoned by the state. I do not agree. The entitlement of those who currently claim will be protected, as all hon. Members recognise. Furthermore, a majority—70 per cent.—of those who fail the new contributions test in the future will qualify for income support. Income support, together with the disability premium, is a little higher than incapacity benefit at some rates, and a little lower at others. But those people are most certainly not abandoned. They will still be protected by the benefit system, and rightly so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I cannot confirm or deny that figure, but I certainly acknowledge that a substantial number of people who would be entitled to claim under the present rules will not be so entitled to do so as a result of the change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gainsborough)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: According to the Library's briefing, the figure of 170,000 was in the Government's own consultation document, "A new contract for welfare: Support for disabled people".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I stand corrected. That is precisely why I have heard of the figure. I knew that it was a substantial number, but I could not recall whether 170,000 was the figure from our explanatory notes or an estimate made by others. However, it is indeed the official figure. Of those 170,000, 70 per cent. will be entitled to income support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the difference between incapacity benefit and income support rates for a single person—the incapacity benefit rate that I use excludes age and dependency additions—between weeks one and 28 of a claim, the income support figure is £1.05 higher than the incapacity benefit level. Between weeks 29 and 52 it is rather lower, by about £6 per week. From weeks 52 onwards, the income support level is £6.55 per week higher than the incapacity benefit level. I appreciate that those figures will fluctuate according to people's different circumstances and different numbers of dependants. However, I note that support will be available to people who no longer qualify for incapacity benefit because of the rules, if they do not have income from another source.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for High Peak (Mr. Levitt), who, as the author of several books and many pamphlets about disability, speaks with great authority, spoke in favour of the balance that the Government have struck between the payment of national insurance contributions on the one hand and the receipt of contributory benefits on the other. He provoked consternation among Opposition Members when he spoke about the large increase in the number of people claiming incapacity benefit over the past 20 years. He made the specific point that one in four men between the ages of 60 and 65 claimed incapacity benefit. That proportion has increased dramatically over the past 18 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It must be right for the Government to ask why that has happened and to seek to address such problems, given that mortality and morbidity rates are falling, and the health of the nation is generally getting better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rendel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I still do not understand the Government's argument. Is the Minister saying that, in practice, some of the people who claim incapacity benefit are not so incapacitated? Is he saying that the large increase in the number of claimants has happened only because, when the previous figure was calculated, people were not claiming the benefit when
	<span class='label label-info column'>872</span>
they could have done so? Does the Minister think that there are fraudulent claims, or that claims are being made honestly but being allowed wrongly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not saying that claims are fraudulent. Claimants submit themselves to the all-work test and are deemed to be incapacitated according to the test result. On that point, the hon. Gentleman and I are at one. Where he and I probably agree, and where Conservative members of the Committee and I probably disagree, is in the interpretation of the all-work test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that approximately 100,000 people on incapacity benefit move into work each year. Passing the all-work test does not mean that people are incapable of undertaking work, and certainly not that they are incapable of undertaking work for the rest of their life. In years past, when there were more jobs—more jobs for older workers and especially for older male workers—I suspect that more people would have remained in employment rather than claim incapacity benefit. However, that is speculation. We must address the question why one in four men over the age of 60 are out of work, are deemed incapable of work and are paid benefit, when, in years past, there has not been such sickness among workers of that age. We must try to find the root of that problem and to address it so that the welfare-to-work strategy works for those people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I make a genuine request for information, not a point. Why does the Minister think that the average time spent on incapacity benefit increased from three years to five years between 1985 and 1995?—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Gedling (Mr. Coaker) says that that could be because there are no jobs in the coalfields. My honest answer is that I do not know why. I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has suggested some homework that I should do, and I shall do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall return to the good point that the hon. Gentleman made earlier about the 170,000 people who will be affected by the proposals. That is a Government figure; it appeared in a consultation document rather than in the explanatory notes to the Bill. The latest estimate is that changes to contribution conditions will result in a fall in the number of people claiming incapacity benefit of about 30,000 in the first year, and of 125,000 after 10 years. That does not alter the point made by the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right that a substantial number of the people who qualify under the present rules do not qualify under the overall package. That package better draws the link between national insurance and national benefits, and better makes opportunities for people on benefits to return to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newbury and the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) asked me to explain which people who currently claim IB will not meet the conditions in future. The answer is straightforward: the conditions will not be met by people who do not meet the new contribution conditions. The majority of those will be long-term
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0949">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>873</span>
unemployed, and they will, of course, have first call on the new deal. We are doing much to ease their path from benefits into work. If the health of a long-term unemployed person broke down, he would move from the non-contributory jobseeker's allowance to income support with a disability premium. In most cases, his income at that point would go up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to the hon. Member for Newbury, no one who passes the all-work test will be forced on to the unemployment register. He suggested that if we believe that too many people claim IB, we should consider changing the rigour of the all-work test. We have most decidedly ruled that out. We give an assurance that everyone who currently qualifies for IB under the all-work test will continue to qualify for it on the same basis. The personal capability assessment, which will replace the all-work test, will assess disability in exactly the same way as the all-work test.

The hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) asked an important question about service wives in Germany. They will not be disadvantaged in any way, because they are excluded from the habitual residence test. The fact that they have been abroad will not change their entitlement to UK benefits when they return to the UK.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. I did not understand the Under-Secretary's answer. Will he expand briefly on what he said?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman's point was that a service wife who accompanies her husband to a posting in Germany might find, when she returns to the UK, that she cannot claim benefits in the same way as someone who has not been abroad. In fact, an habitual residence test will not be applied to her. In other words, her benefit entitlement will not be questioned on the grounds that she was absent from the country during her partner's service in Germany.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I have understood the Minister. He has answered half, but only half, of my question.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Under-Secretary for nodding. That answers the first part of my question, but there remains the second half. Such women typically leave a job when they go to Germany, where they may be unable to find work or they may only find work at the margins, which earns little income. They may simply do a few hours' work at the NAAFI. If the Government accept neither the Conservative nor the Liberal Democrat amendments, which would bring greater flexibility, service wives will fall through a crack in the system, despite the fact that they may have made continuous contributions for many years before their husbands were posted to Germany.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's point. I shall look into the matter and write to him about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Gainsborough made, if I may say so, a very statesmanlike speech. He acknowledged that if the Conservatives were currently in power, they, too, would have had to introduce proposals to reform incapacity benefit. I cannot be fairer than to quote Michael Portillo, who, as Under-Secretary of State for Health and Social Security, said of sickness and unemployment benefits:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Both benefits are designed for people who have been in work and they have been so designed since 1948."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 3 December 1987; c. 397.]</p></blockquote>
I am sure that he meant that the benefits, not the people, have been so designed since 1948. We are returning incapacity benefit to its original purpose. It is a benefit for people who have to give up work because of long-term sickness or disability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Gainsborough also asked for costings of the amendments. The costings relate to long-term costs after 10 years. The best estimate for amendment No. 140 is that it would cost £60 million; amendment No. 197 would cost £45 million; amendment No. 289 would cost £65 million; amendment No. 137 has no cost; and amendment No. 139 would cost £50 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although our ready reckoner will start ticking if the Opposition vote for the amendments, it is obvious that those are not cumulative costs. Some amendments would achieve similar results, and only one would apply. However, I ask Opposition Members to reflect on what would happen if we were to accept amendment No. 140 at a long-term cost of £60 million. The cost of that to the Treasury would be almost as great as the £70 million a year long-term cost of introducing the disability income guarantee. Are we saying that passporting long-term unemployed people on to incapacity benefit is more important than substantially raising the income of the poorest, most severely disabled people? If Committee members say yes, that is their judgment, but it is not the Government's judgment. The Government believe that the priority must be the poorest, most severely disabled people. We would not want to forgo that to release resources to pay for the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rendel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are getting to the heart of the argument. The Under-Secretary said that the clause was not introduced to cut costs. He now seems to be saying that the only real reason for the clause, which is part of a package, is to make it possible for the Government to pay for other things. Both those statements cannot be true. One or the other must be untrue. Was the clause intended to reduce costs to pay for other things, or does it have nothing to do with that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman demonstrates why the Liberal Democrat party is so far from Government. We are not introducing the changes

because we want to make savings to pay for the improvement of other benefits for disabled people. We are introducing the changes because we believe that each one is right and proper and will improve the welfare of disabled people. We do not believe that the Liberal Democrat amendments would enhance the welfare of disabled people. If they were introduced, a real Government in a real world would have to finance them with real money that was raised from the public by taxation. We cannot wish an extra £60 million here, £65 million there and £45 million somewhere else into the Treasury's coffer. The Liberal Democrats may be able to do that at their party conference, but the Treasury cannot do that. We have to live in a real world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The contributory principle, which Committee members have defended, is that people pay national insurance contributions when they are at work so that they can draw out contribution-related benefits at times of need.

Those benefits were not introduced to provide an alternative rate of unemployment benefit for the long-term unemployed. A benefit is available for that purpose—income support—which is more generous for disabled people than the non-contribution-based jobseeker's allowance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>876</span>
reinforced by the contributory principle. One of the benefits of working is that entitlement is built up to better rates of benefit under the contributory principle than are available under the means-tested safety net. That is one of the rewards of work and it strengthens the importance of work. The Liberal Democrats do not agree with the Government and they have made that point many times, but we believe that our proposal is fundamental to improving the standard of living of many people who are currently receiving benefit, including many disabled people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make progress so I shall respond briefly to the point raised by the hon. Member for Beckenham about carers. She expressed concern that they would not be fully and properly protected, but I hope that my response to the hon. Member for Winchester has reassured her.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now respond briefly to the detailed points raised on the amendments. There are two contribution conditions for entitlement to incapacity benefit and the clause changes the first one. At the moment, a person is required to have paid a certain amount of contributions in any one tax year during his or her working life, however long ago. The required amount is contributions on earnings equivalent to 25 times the lower earnings limit, which is currently £66 a week. Someone who earns £1,650 during a period of 25 weeks or less will meet the requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 51 requires the contributions to have been paid in one of the two previous tax years, rather than in any year. The amount required is the same: 25 times the lower earnings limit. That requirement is entirely reasonable and consistent with the purpose of incapacity benefit, which is to provide a replacement income for people who previously had earnings from work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second contribution condition for incapacity benefit requires contributions or credits equivalent to 50 times the lower earnings limit in both the previous two tax years. Clause 51 leaves that requirement unchanged and people will continue to be able to satisfy that condition by credits alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (4) enables regulations to be made to deem the new first contribution condition to be satisfied or applied with modifications in prescribed cases. In our consultation document last autumn and the explanatory notes to the Bill, we made it clear that we would make special provision for two specific groups: former recipients of invalid care allowance and people who were previously on incapacity benefit. The regulation-making powers in subsection (4) are intended to help those two groups. We also intend to protect fully the benefit rights of employees, who will no longer pay contributions when the national insurance threshold is aligned to the single person's tax allowance. That will be achieved through further measures, which have been tabled for the Committee's consideration. I hope that they will be discussed soon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first two amendments, which were tabled by the hon. Member for Newbury and the hon. Member for Winchester, seek an entirely different test from that proposed by the Government. The amendments would mean that people would be able to qualify for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0951">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>877</span>
incapacity benefit even if many years had passed since they had paid the necessary amount of contributions—up to six and half years in the case of amendment No. 197, and nine years or more in the case of amendment No. 140. The Government do not believe that that would be right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 140 would also mean that people who have been working and paying contributions in the past two years, but who did not accumulate enough contributions in both years, would find it much harder to qualify than under the existing arrangements. Those in recent work should be able to obtain incapacity benefit even if they paid contributions in only one year, rather than two. That is consistent with our principle that incapacity benefit should provide for workers whose illness or disability has forced them to give up work. I would therefore urge the Committee to reject the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The remaining amendments provide alternative tests or exemptions for certain groups—I shall start with carers of disabled people. Amendment No. 289 would enable people to qualify if they had been caring full-time in 12 of the past 24 months and had paid five years' contributions. Amendment No. 138 would deem people to have satisfied the first contribution condition if they were entitled to invalid care allowance for 25 weeks in the past two tax years. I hope that I have already dealt with the arguments of the hon. Member for Winchester for those two amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have always made it clear that carers who have been receiving ICA will be protected from the effect of the proposed change. Because of their caring responsibilities, ICA recipients may not have had the opportunity to pay contributions in the past two tax years. We aim to retain the status quo for former recipients of ICA. Those who would currently satisfy the second condition by virtue of credit will continue to qualify for incapacity benefit, as long as they have paid contributions in any tax year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 138 would differ from the status quo in two ways, both of which are undesirable. First, it would exclude some people who currently qualify, as it requires 25 ICA credits. Currently, one ICA credit in the most recent tax year—in combination with other credits—would suffice. Secondly, the amendments go further than the current arrangements by deeming some ICA recipients to have satisfied the first contribution condition even if they have not paid any contributions. It is reasonable to expect people to have made a modest national insurance contribution in order to receive a contributory benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two Conservative amendments would apply generally to people earning below the earnings limit, although they would do so in different ways. Amendment No. 231 would exempt from the new contribution condition anyone who has been earning below the lower earnings limit for the past two years. Amendment No. 289 would exempt anyone with 12 months' earnings below the lower earnings limit if they had paid contributions for five years in the past.
	<span class='label label-info column'>878</span>
Neither amendment would exempt people from the second contribution condition, but that would be necessary if the condition were to extend beyond disability working allowance recipients and unemployed people who have been working while on benefit. I assume that the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford would want to include people who have been working and who have not been on benefits in the past two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some people who have not had the opportunity to pay contributions should be able to qualify for incapacity benefit. As I said, we will protect the position of carers who have not paid contributions in the past two years. We will also make special provision for new help for young people who have never had the opportunity to contribute. People who earn below the lower earnings limit have not necessarily been prevented, other than by their own choice, from working to a greater extent and paying contributions. Such people would not qualify at present, and extending incapacity benefit to them regardless of their circumstances would, therefore, represent a significant breach of the contributory principle that Opposition Members claim to be keen to defend. It would also have the perverse effect of giving people access to a benefit that was higher in value than the earnings that they received while in work. I am sure that the Committee agrees that it would be wrong in principle for a non-means-tested benefit of more than £66 a week to go to someone who normally earned, say, £10 a week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want now to move away from specific groups. Amendment No. 139 would introduce the alternative contribution condition that people who had paid contributions of a relevant class in any seven years would be entitled to incapacity benefit, even if they were unemployed for some time before their claim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 289 would provide for a five-year test for people with 12 months of credits in the previous two years, which would also apply to the unemployed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people who paid contributions for several years in the past may be disappointed not to qualify for incapacity benefit. That would, however, be entirely inconsistent with the aims of the Government's reforms. I stress again that incapacity benefit should essentially be provided for people who have to stop work because of illness or disability. Our proposals are designed to restore incapacity benefit to that role. It is not right that people who have been unemployed for a substantial period should move onto incapacity benefit if they become sick or disabled. Income support is available to provide for people in that situation who do not have an adequate income. Accordingly, we cannot accept the amendment, and I urge the Committee to reject it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, amendment No. 137 would require, rather than allow, the Secretary of State to make regulations under subsection (4). It is our clear intention to use the powers that the subsection provides to help carers and people who were formerly on incapacity benefit. As the Committee has heard in debates on previous amendments, however, it is a general convention in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0952">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>879</span>
legislation for the Secretary of State to be permitted rather than required to make regulations. That is why the clause is phrased as it is. The hon. Member for Winchester nods to acknowledge that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has covered a wide range of issues, some of which are very detailed. The essential point is how far the benefits system should provide earnings replacement for people who have not recently been in employment and paid contributions. I hope that on the basis of my remarks, the Committee will agree that the Government's proposals strike a balance and that the amendments should be withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's speech has reinforced my conviction that we were absolutely right to table the amendments, particularly No. 289, which summarises what we want to achieve in the clause. The object of the operation can be summed up simply. Those with a contribution record who have worked for a significant period are entitled to the benefit of their contributions. They have paid the premium and are entitled to a pay-out on the policy if they become disabled or incapacitated. It is wrong to breach that principle. Anybody who satisfies the requirement for a reasonable period of employment and national insurance contributions and who becomes incapacitated should not be prevented from claiming incapacity benefit because of some event that is not his or her responsibility, or which results from him or her accepting family responsibilities, such as looking after small children or a sick or disabled person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the point of amendment No. 289. We specifically say in the amendment that a prerequisite of the derogations and protections for the relevant groups is that people should have a five-year real contribution record at some time. We could have specified seven, 10 or four years, but we specified five years as an earnest of the seriousness with which we take the contributory principle. People should not be deprived of benefits to which they have contributed for so long. They should not be penalised for giving up work and, therefore, ceasing to pay contributions, because of carrying out vital social roles. And thank heaven they do! I do not know whether the New Labour Government intend to produce a society in which people do not look after their children and are not prepared—often selflessly, because the amount of money they give up is out of proportion to any benefit income—to take care of a permanently sick or disabled person. I do know that the new Labour Government seriously want to penalise those fine human impulses, which humanise society. Even if they do not intend to, they are doing so by means of the present measure and that is disgraceful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that we must not allow provisions that give people entitlement who have had no connection with the national insurance system. That is absurd, because our commitment to the national insurance principle is both positive and negative. That means, I am afraid, that we cannot support a couple of the Liberal Democrat amendments that would have that affect. But I have always said that we will support amendment No. 140 if it is put to the vote.

	<span class='label label-info column'>880</span>
From the scope that you allowed the Under-Secretary in his response, Mr. Malins—he touched on many subjects and general principles, dealing with the clause as a whole, the Bill as a whole and many things that had nothing to do with either—I sense, from my limited experience of this place, which is not, however, totally negligible, that you are probably moving towards not allowing a clause stand part debate. That I understand; equally, I think it important that I should be allowed to deal with the arguments of the hon. Gentleman, some of which alleged mistakes on my part that do not exist. I should like to set the record straight on that, if nothing else, even if it means going a bit wide of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. First, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will stay within the clause. Secondly, we have had a long debate. Thirdly, of course he must feel free to deal with some of the Under-Secretary's observations, but I hope that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As always, I will make every effort to ensure that my remarks are neither irrelevant nor repetitious. Of course I will remain within the clause but, like the Under-Secretary, I may be unable to remain strictly within the amendments. I warn the hon. Gentleman that I have some strictures for him. First, the Government were clever to appoint him to play the frankly unedifying and distasteful role in which he has been cast. If someone is to defend the indefensible, that person should be of a naturally emollient and reasonable disposition. It would have been a tactical error for the hon. Gentleman to have confronted directly the very reasonable accusations that Opposition Members were making. It is much more sensible to give the impression of being such a nice, caring person that the measures with which one is associated cannot be that bad. That is a clever PR move by the Government. Anything I say should not detract from the fact that the hon. Gentleman performed his uninviting—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I understand what the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may finish my sentence for the sake of coherence and for the sake of 	<i>Hansard</i> writers, the Government did well to choose the Under-Secretary to perform the uninviting task that he has been instructed to perform this afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me deal specifically with the points that the Under-Secretary raised, which need much dealing with. It is slightly less generous to the hon. Gentleman, but not in the least unfair, if I say that I was surprised at a remark of his. Perhaps it was the manifestation of his disarming manner going a little too far—perhaps it was an unthinking comment, meant to be charming. I hope that it was no more than that—that it was unthinking and does not reflect reality. The Under-Secretary told my hon. Friend the Member for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0953">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>881</span>
Gainsborough that he did not know, had not thought about but ought to think about why people were now remaining longer on incapacity benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's contention is that incapacity benefit needs to be reformed—they use that word, but they mean cut back and savaged—because too many people are on it and are spending too long on it. In their documents, the Government emphasise the latter factor. So it is extraordinary that the Under-Secretary, who is responsible for the policy, has not thought about the reasons behind that factor, which forms the whole basis for his extremely unattractive package of proposals to cut incapacity benefit. That fact can be explained only by the hypothesis that I put to the Committee this morning: that the whole exercise is driven by the Treasury, which wants £700 million, and that it is not for the Under-Secretary to reason why, he must simply do his best somehow to soft soap the Committee into feeling that the measures are not as pernicious as they really are. As I proceed, it will become clear how genuinely pernicious they are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary would, of course, never seek to misinform or deceive the Committee, but he said something which, unless corrected, is certainly in danger of giving a false impression to the Committee and the public. He said that the Government's objective was to return the position of incapacity benefit to what it was 10 years ago? Did he not say that? Yes, he did. He said that the measure was purely one of restoration, that something had gone wrong with incapacity benefit during the past few years and that he wanted to return to the regime of 10 years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What happened 10 years ago? There was a benefit called invalidity benefit, which had different terms attached to it in certain respects. There were earnings-related and age-related supplements and the benefit was not subject to income tax. Have the Government today suggested adding to incapacity benefit an earnings or an age-related supplement, or relieving it from income tax? Good heavens no, they are suggesting quite the reverse; they suggest making the benefit less generous to the disabled and the incapacitated, not returning to the previous higher level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it true that the contribution conditions have changed, as the Under-Secretary suggested? No, they have not changed at all. The implication was that the contribution conditions in clause 51, which we are invited to accept today, existed 10 years ago. Nothing is further from the truth. The conditions in the clause are an invention either of the Department of Social Security—which I do not believe—or of the Treasury, which has instructed that means are to be found to force people off the benefit, or at least to prevent them from claiming it when it would otherwise be their entitlement. It is as simple as that and no one should be in any doubt about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister then had another problem. He saw me rising in my place and thought—he is very quick and sharp—good heavens, he is going to tell me that it is disingenuous to compare the short with the long term.
	<span class='label label-info column'>882</span>
He realised that I was about to say that if we are to compare the financial position of the Government with what must be the exact reflection—the losses or gains of beneficiaries, in this case, those who are disabled—we must make the comparison over the long term in both cases. It is no use saying that more money will be spent on the disabled in the next six months, but that in time we will claw back a multiple of 10 times or 20 times that amount which is the actual position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister then decided on a clever ploy. He said that in this Parliament, total spending on the disabled will increase by £1 billion. That has nothing to do with the comparison. The Minister could use the figure of £10 billion, £20 billion or £100 billion; that would make no difference. We must look at both sides of the balance sheet. The important point is whether the revenue associated with the benefit is increasing. Only a small proportion of that revenue is hypothecated for the payment of invalidity benefit. However, the rate of increase of national insurance over this Parliament will be far higher than the rate of increase in total spending on the disabled—spending that is financed from the national insurance fund and other means. Let there be no doubt that the difference between the revenue and spending figures represents the clawback and that the clawback is real. I do not know whether the Under-Secretary wishes to intervene, but he is very welcome to do so if he thinks that I was wrong about that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, expenditure on the disabled is increasing in nominal terms. That is because we are all living longer, that disabled included. I do not think that the new Labour Government want to kill off the disabled—they have not gone that far. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I did not suggest that. The error is one of logic; I do not suggest that there is a conspiracy to murder, but there is a serious error of logic of which the Government may fall victim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary may not have thought through the plans properly. The absolute sum spent on the disabled will increase. With all Government expenditure, the absolute sum spent increases. Even the absolute sum spent on defence has increased, even though in real terms it has fallen from what it was in 1950 or in 1960. It means nothing to say that such spending will increase by £1 billion during this Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is important to know is whether the net position will be favourable to the Treasury or the disabled. We know now that benefit spending will be more favourable to the Treasury than to the disabled. The size of the clawback as a multiple of the additional sums spent on the disabled 10 years hence will be remarkable. The full clawback from incapacity benefit will be £750 million and a further £100 million will be gained from the abolition of severe disablement allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary made a fatuous point, which underestimated the intelligence of Members of the Committee. It may have reflected the genuine confusion in his mind because he has been put up by the Government to defend the unpleasant policy. He did not like my earlier point that someone who ceased
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0954">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>883</span>
to contribute as little as 13 months before he became disabled would lose his right to incapacity benefit. I said this morning that people could contribute year on year for 10, 20, 30 or 40 years and still find that, because they had perhaps become unemployed, they no longer had a contributions record. After a gap in contributions of 13 months from becoming disabled, they would have lost everything to which their contributions record would otherwise have entitled them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister did not like that example and quoted figures for people who earned more than that lower income limit. If one earns more than the lower income limit—the earnings factor is based on that limit—then one can make the required contribution in less than the maximum period. On higher earnings, one may make the payments in three or four months. However, that point is not relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister did not dispute that someone at the lower earnings limit—on the lower end of the pay scale—would face the unsatisfactory position that I described. That concern is relevant to the disabled not merely because their conditions tend to be regressive rather than progressive, deteriorating over time for various reasons. They may find that when they must give up employment, their capacity to earn is low and they may be at or near the lower earnings limit. The figures that I quoted were perfectly valid for the circumstances of such people. It was a relevant point, which the Government did not like or want to confront. Therefore, we heard all sorts of dreadful cases of people who were more fortunate. I do not doubt that if people are more fortunate and the figures are adjusted accordingly, the Government can obtain different results but that is characteristic of the way in which new Labour spokesmen have dealt with our arguments on this and other clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nothing in today's debate provided clearer evidence of the Government's desperate need for help than the fact that for the first time, Labour Back Benchers have been told to come on board and contribute their firepower. Even if that was not very powerful, it was desperately required because it was extremely important that the poor Minister who had to defend such an obnoxious policy had some support—preferably support in the form of entirely irrelevant interventions designed to throw me off my stride. I trust that the Labour Members who played that game are not at all satisfied with the results as regards throwing me off my stride.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the course of their interventions, which I intend to deal with and quote from, Labour Back Benchers said some extremely revealing things about the mentality of new Labour with regard to the benefits system, the national insurance system and people who are disabled—the attitude towards the disabled revealed by some of the interventions was the most worrying aspect of all. I suppose that the interventions were spontaneous; presumably Labour Back Benchers were told just to say something, so I imagine that what they said came straight from the heart.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>884</span>
The hon. Member for High Peak said that the unemployed were out of touch with the labour market. That is an extraordinary definition of the unemployed, which is at variance with the tradition of unemployment pay in this country. People are not out of touch with the job market when they are unemployed and receiving what used to be unemployment pay and is now the jobseeker's allowance; they are trying to get back into the job market and they have an obligation to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We introduced jobseeker's allowance and the various disciplines that went with it to ensure that people took their obligations seriously. The Labour party further enhanced those disciplines—with our support—to ensure that people tried to get back into the labour market. If Labour Members found themselves unemployed, which is likely after the next election, how would they like it if people told them that they were now out of touch with the job market? Knowing them as I do, they would honestly try to get back into the perfectly respectable and useful jobs that they had before they entered the House and I would wish them the best of luck in doing so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely, as Labour Members, they are by definition out of touch with the job market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the context of today's debate, my hon. Friend makes a fair point. However, I do not want to mock the position of Labour Members if and when they lose their jobs. I take no pleasure in anyone losing their job. We can all lose our jobs. Our career is an uncertain one, but that is true for almost everyone—civil servants have slightly more job security.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact is that people are not out of touch with the job market because they are not employed. They ought not to be out of touch with the job market—that is the basis on which they receive jobseeker's allowance. In 95 per cent. if not 99 per cent. of cases, psychologically they are not out of touch. They are desperately trying to stay in touch with the job market. I cannot think of anything crueller to say of the unemployed than that they are out of touch with the job market. That was a spontaneous contribution from the hon. Member for High Peak, and very revealing it was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nor have I forgotten the hon. Member for Gravesham, who in his supposedly spontaneous intervention talked about clause 51 strengthening the link with work for the disabled. For those who have a record of work and contributions—people who may have worked extremely hard for many years, if not decades—this breaks the connection between their contributions, work record and entitlement to invalidity benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I said—and we will see my remarks in the 	<i>Official Report</i>—that the provisions strengthen the contribution principle. That is a slightly different point, although I accept that it helps to maintain the link between work and disability.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Strengthening the contributions principle is an entirely unscrupulous and Orwellian fashion of describing what the Bill does, and it is quite scandalous. If the hon. Member for Gravesham, looks at the next clause, he will see that it deals with means-testing for incapacity benefit. By definition, means-tesing breaks the contributory principle, so I do not know how he is labouring under such illusions. He is a victim of the double-speak that is so prevalent in the modern, new Labour party. I bitterly regret that double-speak, which does not contribute to honest debate or to the dignity of political discourse in Britain.

The comments made by the hon. Member for Gravesham also gave the Committee a significant insight into what new Labour thinks about people bringing up children or caring for disabled or sick people. He spoke in the context of a group of amendments containing amendment No. 289, which is designed to protect such people. The hon. Gentleman does not propose to support that amendment. The modern Labour party, new Labour, does not think that looking after children or caring for the long-term sick is a valid role in life. Unlike Conservative Members, it does not believe that such work is of equal value to work in the labour market, which is very revealing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State decided that he ought, out of gallantry or a sense of solidarity among Ministers, to ride to the help of his embattled colleague the Under-Secretary. And what did he say? He spoke about the present system of incapacity benefit providing "an incentive to become sick". What does it logically mean if a Minister of State in the Department of Social Security says that incapacity benefit provides an incentive for people to become sick? It means that the Government believe that invalidity benefit has been exploited and is being significantly taken over by malingerers and dishonest scroungers. The Minister could not have justified his remark with any other argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That contribution is now on record, and Opposition Members will not allow the Government easily to forget it. The attitude to the disabled that was so vividly and unpleasantly illustrated by that remark has led the Government to draft the clause. The Opposition feel strongly that it must not be agreed to if Britain is to have any sense that the Government are treating disabled people properly and fairly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have spoken about the double-speak of the new Labour Government. I am sure that you, Mr. Malins, read with care all of the papers relevant to our debates before presiding so ably over our proceedings. Chapter 6 of the new Labour Government's glossy Green Paper entitled "A new contract for welfare" is entitled "Support for disabled people". If you have read it, Mr. Malins, you will have been struck by its first line, which appears on page 51 and states:
	<span class='label label-info column'>886</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Those who are disabled should get the support they need to lead a fulfilling life with dignity."</p></blockquote>
Does that mean that disabled people were not previously receiving the support that they needed? Does it mean that now the new Labour Government are going to give them more support than they previously had? Does it mean that the new Labour Government believe that they are getting the support and are committed to making sure that they continue to get it? There are only two possible meanings that one can give to that sentence. Both those promises—to do better than the Tories, or at least to do as well and maintain existing levels of support—would be traduced by the proposed measure. What an insult to the disabled to try to pretend that something that is going to withdraw entitlement to incapacity benefit for hundreds of thousands of future claimants is nothing more than a benefit, or a new form of support, for the disabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What tactless, insensitive temerity to say in one breath, "They are just a bunch of scroungers, the disabled people who are getting the incapacity benefit, and we must do something about it", then to say a moment later,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Those who are disabled should get the support they need to lead a fulfilling life with dignity",</p></blockquote>
and to withdraw the existing level of support. What shameless arrogance to suppose that one can do that kind of thing and get away with it; to suppose that one can persuade people that they are better off and better protected by clobbering them; to suppose that they will believe one when one says that one is committed to the national insurance principle while systematically undermining the national insurance principle, as is happening here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am proud that we in the Conservative party never thought of taking such measures when we were in power. We made our share of mistakes, and received our share of criticisms of different kinds. However, we never trampled on the contributory principle in this fashion. We never decided that the disabled were the softest target, and went for them if we needed to raise a bit of money in a hurry for some purpose. I am proud that we stand today on our previous record, which is that the disabled, far from being a soft target and an easy touch for a Government, are a group of vulnerable people who should be the last people to be disadvantaged when changes are made to our welfare and benefits system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Future generations will remember this, because people will find that when they become disabled they will no longer get the support to which they had been brought up to believe they were entitled. People will no longer get the support that they have been paying for up to the moment when the Bill is enacted. That will be a black day for our national insurance system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am proud to present our amendments to the Committee, especially No. 289, which would genuinely deliver the principle that

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oaten</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Little did I know how wrong I was when I said at the start of the Committee's proceedings that we were on the home straight. Little did I know also how true it would prove to be when I suggested that the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford is far better at being outraged about these things. We heard about an hour and a half of outrage this morning. I must learn in the course of my career how to work myself up into such frenzies. Having said that, Liberal Democrats are sympathetic towards much of what the hon. Gentleman said, if not the manner in which it came across.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has been broad and many good points have been raised, and the Minister has been particular in dealing with hon. Members' interventions and questions. Nevertheless, of all the days on which we would have expected some form of compromise or change in stance on the part of the Government, that has not happened. That is disappointing, because the arguments have been strong and powerful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am especially concerned that there has been little acknowledgement of the changes to the contributions period. The decision to narrow it to a two-year period before one can get the contribution has not been acknowledged by the Minister to be unfair and against the spirit of the contributions system. It is the something-for-nothing approach. That important principle has been firmly held in this country for a long time and the Minister has not acknowledged the fact that they are breaking it. We have heard only one justification for the Government's approach, namely, its financial benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened carefully to the Minister's speech, but he has not convinced me that he believes that he is creating a fairer system. The Government's proposals are not fair and they are contrary to many of the principles of natural justice and fairness. It cannot be right for the clause to exclude someone who has made contributions for 10 or 20 years. We cannot get away from that fact, regardless of the number of other systems that are introduced to cushion the blow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's comments on carers were extremely helpful. I acknowledge his response to amendment No. 137, which I shall not press further. He gave an assurance that the Government will try to find a way round the anomaly for those carers who have some form of care allowance. I am grateful to him for clarifying the situation, although it would have been nice to include an appropriate right plainly and clearly in the Bill. However, I accept the Minister's statement that other parts of the Bill will offer those people some protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister did not answer the fundamental question about how one deals with carers who do not receive a care allowance. Many people may be involved. He did not make it clear whether carers who receive home responsibility protection will be included in the group that receives other benefits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I must disappoint the hon. Gentleman. Home responsibility protection in effect provides a state pension credit for people who
	<span class='label label-info column'>888</span>
stay at home to look after small children. It is not a passport to other benefits, and we do not propose to change that arrangement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oaten</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful and disappointed at the same time. The Government should help carers who receive the invalid care allowance and other carers. A small compromise was available to the Government, but they failed to take action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State said time and again that the proposals are designed to get the sick back to work. However, they will create a perverse incentive for the sick to remain sick and avoid going to work. Some people may think that it is better to protect their benefit by remaining on it than to come off it. They might dip into the employment market but fail to get long-term work, after which, two or three years' unemployment might result. When they try to get back on to the benefit, they might fail to do so because they had not made sufficient contributions during a two or three-year period. I hope that the Minister will comment on that perverse incentive, which does not encourage sick people to get back into work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Gainsborough made an impressive and thought-provoking speech. His comments went to the heart of the matter. He discussed the Government's arguments for their proposals and their methods for dealing with the increasing number of people who receive incapacity benefit. The Government have not shown that their approach is the right way to tackle that problem. It would have made much more sense if the Minister had said, "We are not going to deal with this matter for the moment. We are going to wait until the other measures that we discussed—the pilots and the new deal for the disabled—come into effect." Let us see how the pilots work. That is the purpose of pilot schemes. Let us wait and see whether they provide evidence that they are helping disabled people in the workplace. Let us see how the provisions bed down and how successful they are, rather than introducing cuts without seeing whether the work benefits are fulfilled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disappointed that the timescale has not been thought through and I hope that the Government will think again about our proposals even at this late stage. We feel strongly that they should have made changes to the narrow banding of contributions. We are looking for a compromise on those issues and we shall press amendment No. 140 to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rendel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make two quick points concerning significant illogicalities in the Government's thinking. The first concerns the number of people who are incapacitated. The Government insist that many more people claim incapacity benefit now than some years ago and that that cannot be because people are sicker now than several years ago. They seem to believe that many of those who are claiming incapacity benefit now do not need it and should not be receiving it. Yet, they are not making the test stronger or more difficult, which might have been the logical way of dealing with the matter, but not necessarily what I would support. They are excluding people who are incapacitated—they admit that they
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0957">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>889</span>
are incapacitated—purely on the basis of how many national insurance contributions they have made and when. That is not a sensible way of achieving their aim.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Have not the Government resolved the dilemma? Inadvertently or not, they have made it clear where they stand. The Minister of State said that the present situation provides an incentive for people to become sick. If they believe that the existence of a benefit is an incentive to become sick, clearly they believe that the people claiming it are malingering, bogus, dishonest and fraudulent. That is what the Government believe of a large number, if not the majority, of current beneficiaries of incapacity benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rendel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sympathise with what the hon. Gentleman said. The Government seem to be muddled because when the Minister of State made the statement to which the hon. Gentleman referred, the Government were also saying that some of those on incapacity benefit should not be receiving it but that it is not necessary to tighten the test and that doctors are not letting people through who should not be allowed through. The Government's thinking is contradictory and I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's comment because it shows how extraordinarily muddled they are. They have made statements that are incompatible on two different occasions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are also muddled about their intentions. We have chased them through the arguments, but whenever we show them why their argument is illogical, they say that they were making another argument. First, the Minister seemed to say that some measures in the Bill would cut costs. It would have been logical if the Government had said that that was necessary to introduce other measures to benefit disabled people. We could understand that they may need to save costs in one area to be able to provide greater benefits in another. However, they said that the provisions are not Treasury driven, so when we pressed them on whether the purpose of the clauses is to cut costs, they said that that was not their intention and that the cost savings are incidental. They said that the purpose of the clauses is to benefit people with incapacities as part of a package. When we asked why the clauses were necessary, the Government were under pressure. If there is no need for one clause to fit in with a package, it can be left out, which is what I suspect the Opposition will ask the Government to do when we vote in a few minutes. The Government said that the clause is necessary so that incapacity benefit fits in with the original contributions system. That leads to another illogicality. Although Ministers have been forced to say that the only purpose of the clause is to return to the contributory principle, it is clear that those who pay greater contributions will rarely receive incapacity benefit. Those who make lower contributions, on the other hand, will receive incapacity benefit. The Government are contradicting themselves—they appear to be working against the interests that they claim to promote.

When we debated clause 51, we mentioned the change to the important principles that relate to contributions. Clause 52 goes to the heart of another change of principle—that of means-testing and its relation to benefits. It will be interesting to see whether the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford has peaked in his outrage. I hope that he has some left for this clause, because it is worthy of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of groups in the disability sector and across political parties are concerned that, by reducing benefits for those who have an occupational personal pension, we are moving towards a different and important principle. I do not want to enter that debate now because you will call me to order, Mr. Malins, although I may touch on it when we debate the next cluster of amendments. The purpose of this narrow
	<span class='label label-info column'>892</span>
clause is to probe the Government on what they are trying to achieve by changing aspects of means-testing and pensionability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government appear concerned that their proposals will have a perverse incentive. People who want to draw on their pensions may decide, because of the changes, that it is not in their interests to do so. I think that the Government fear that many people who are entitled to a private, separate pension at 60 will decide to defer that pension until they are 65. Under the clause, anyone who decides to draw such a pension at 60 will have their incapacity benefit cut as a consequence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wording of the clause implies that the Government are worried that a flood of people will defer their pensions. To get around that, the Government have said that even if people defer their pensions and do not take them between 60 and 65, they will still regard them as notional income that could have been claimed during that period. By specifying that the money is payable and not paid, the Government are saying that they regard the amount as notional income. However, someone who deferred his pension might still find that his incapacity benefit was being cut between the age of 60 to 65. I would be grateful if the Minister could give evidence to explain the Government's position. Will he confirm that their position explains why they use the language in the clause?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would also be grateful if the Minister could acknowledge that the provisions could cause more problems than he has been advised. Does he acknowledge that the outcome of the changes could be that individuals who, for various reasons, do not want to take their pensions at 60, but want to defer them until later in their lives because they want to do other things, will be almost forced to take them at 60 rather than take the "do nothing and defer" option? An individual who faces the choice will know that deferring his pension will involve the loss of incapacity benefit and might just as well take the pension. If it is to be regarded as notional income and his incapacity benefit is to be cut as if he were getting his pension, he might as well have the pension in the first place. Indeed, some individuals might need to draw their pension to survive financially because of the notional cut to their incapacity benefit. It must be fairer to base the changes to the incapacity level and means-testing in relation to the pension on what individuals are actually paid rather than on a notional sum that they will not get.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be grateful if the Minister could clarify another concern. What happens in the case of somebody who defers his pension until he is 65, whose incapacity benefits are cut by the notional amount for the years 60 to 65, and who then dies when he is 65 without getting the pension that he was due and for which he was waiting? From 60 to 65, the pension was taken as being paid. That is clearly an unfair anomaly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will deal with the principle in great detail on the next cluster of clauses. We are tabling a narrow, probing amendment to discover why the Government feel the need to include the word "payable". I would be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0959">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>893</span>
grateful if the Minister could respond to the concerns that many people have about the Bill's unfair way of narrowing individuals' flexibility in relation to their pensions later in their lives. Many of them will have saved and budgeted for their final few years and will have juggled figures for the pension and incapacity benefit that they will receive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rendel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What would happen if somebody deferred his pension at 60 in a way that was irrevocable under the terms of his occupational pension, and became incapacitated shortly after? Would he have to survive for five years without incapacity benefit or his pension? I would be interested to know how the Government see their way through that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard Flight 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Arundel and South Downs)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Winchester set out the point of the two amendments extremely clearly. I simply want to add the following points. First, without the amendments, the clause is impractical. There are many circumstances in which individuals can take a pension early, but it is not known how much they can take until the actuary works it out. Someone aged 63 or even 55 could easily take an early pension within the terms of a pension scheme, but not do so—understandably, because that substantially reduces one's pension for the rest of one's life. In that situation, there would be no way of calculating what the means-tested give back would be under the clause. People who have not taken an early pension do not know what its value would have been. In many cases, it is impossible to make a precise calculation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, on the point of principle, and picking up on the point made by the hon. Member for Winchester, I repeat what I have just said: if people take a pension early, that is at the cost of their pension for the rest of their life. Most pension schemes still provide for a pension at 65; most of them, whether corporate, personal or small company, have a facility whereby, if people stops work early—in some cases, even at 50—they can take a pension early, but, depending on how young they take it, they may end up halving or reducing even further the pension that they then receive for the rest of their life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it seems utterly monstrous for the clause to force people to take early pensions—much lesser pensions that will impoverish them relative to what would otherwise be their situation—from the age of 65 onwards. As has been pointed out, the clause could have that effect. What will people live on? If they suffer a disability and must stop work at 55 or 57, apparently, if they have any right to take early pension, they could easily lose all or a greater part of their incapacity allowance. It would be entirely wrong—and entirely analogous to the pensions mis-advice for which insurance companies are being fined billions of pounds—if the Government were to put pressure on people that led them to do the wrong thing with regard to their pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>894</span>
In summary, without the two amendments, the clause will be impractical, as precise figures cannot be known. Morally, it is outrageous for legislation to force people in effect to take mis-advice with regard to their pension arrangements for the whole of their old age.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was proceeding to say that this is the most important, because it is the most obnoxious, clause in the Bill. It would therefore be a great dereliction of the Committee's duty if we so conducted ourselves as to deprive ourselves of a clause stand part debate. Whatever may have been the position during our debate on the previous clause—I did not seriously seek to oppose the ruling to which I thought you were tending, Mr. Malins—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman was in no position to oppose my ruling. Whether he sought to oppose it seriously or not seriously, neither eventuality amounted to a row of beans.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We accepted your ruling, Mr. Malins, as we always do, but sometimes we accept your rulings with greater surprise than on other occasions. I was not enormously surprised by your conclusion concerning the previous clause, but it would be wrong of us to put ourselves in the same position now. The hon. Member for Winchester was disciplined and focused in what he said, and I shall be as well. I shall address only the amendments tabled in my name and those of my hon. Friends, and leave all general comments on the clause for the clause stand part debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would remove rights that the Government are trying to assume: the right to force people to take an early pension, or earlier pensions than they otherwise would, and to impose a notional income on those who decline to take a pension when they are able to do so and to use that notional income to means-test their entitlement to incapacity benefit. I used the word obnoxious. Clearly, it would be immensely obnoxious if the Government had such powers for a range of reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs said, it is extremely expensive to take a pension early. Bringing forward a pension greatly reduces its value—even bringing it forward by a few years makes a substantial difference to the pension that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0960">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>895</span>
is received. Anyone who does that faces a considerable reduction in income and thus in the standard to which they would otherwise have looked forward in retirement. Moreover, it is a permanent reduction—there is almost certainly nothing that they can do to rebuild their income in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman realise that precisely that rule already applies to jobseeker's allowance, that it has done so for some years, and that it was introduced by the Conservative Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Good gracious, Mr. Malins. Here we go again. The Government cannot distinguish between people who are unemployed—unemployment may happen to anyone, but it is hopefully not permanent—and someone who becomes disabled. The hon. Gentleman does not seem to have listened to what I said to his hon. Friend the Minister of State this morning when the latter implied—I thought quite disgracefully—that there was no difference between someone who became unemployed temporarily and someone who might be blinded or paralysed by life. That is an extraordinary attitude to take. There is a fundamental and qualitative difference about disability, which the Under-Secretary, who appears to have responsibility for the disabled, has not yet grasped.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To clarify, is the hon. Gentleman telling the Committee that it is right for a man who is unemployed to be required to take out a pension in certain circumstances at a particular age, but that it is not right—in fact, that it is morally wrong—to require the same of someone on incapacity benefit? There is, of course, the implication, which the hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs rightly spelled out, that if one takes a pension early, the weekly amount will be lower, although the actuarial value will be the same. Why is it morally right to do that for someone on jobseeker's allowance, but morally wrong to do it for someone on incapacity benefit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I honestly think that the hon. Gentleman is suffering from a failure of moral perception if he cannot see the difference between disability, which in many cases is long term and often permanent, and unemployment. We do not believe that unemployment should be permanent; far from it. What is more, people who have been unemployed can get back the same type of job—sometimes it is a better job, sometimes it is not, but there is no reason why it should not be as good a job as the one that they had before. That is rarely the case with people who have been disabled. Of course there is a fundamental difference between the disabled and those who simply change jobs and have periods of unemployment. It is extraordinary that the Under-Secretary cannot see that. There is no doubt that our debates have revealed the state of mind of the Labour party which has made it possible for them to target the disabled in the way that they have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to the Under-Secretary's point that the financial consequences are also not comparable, contributory jobseeker's allowance lasts for only six
	<span class='label label-info column'>896</span>
months, as the hon. Gentleman ought to know—judging by some of the things that he said earlier today, I am not sure that he does know about his own benefit system. Incapacity benefit can last indefinitely. Thus, the amount of money that people will lose as a result of the means-testing of jobseeker's allowance will be defined, whereas the financial loss resulting from the means-testing of incapacity benefit is open ended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it extraordinary that the Under-Secretary needed me to point out those essential matters to him. The essential difference, of course, is between those of us who are able bodied and those who are not. Special help by the state is justified by virtue of the fact of disability, but the Under-Secretary clearly does not believe that. That is the fundamental divide between the two sides of the Committee. That difference has enabled the Labour party to introduce measures which the Conservative party would never have dreamt of considering when in office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am returning to the amendment as rapidly as I can, Mr. Malins, but you will understand that I had to respond to such an extraordinary statement. I know that you will not allow the Government so to conduct the proceedings on the amendments as to forestall a clause stand part debate. There are many good reasons why the Government would want to prevent Parliament from discussing clauses in the Bill, but Parliament should not be bamboozled or manipulated by the Government in that fashion, otherwise the whole balance between the Executive branch and the legislature will break down rapidly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first aspect of the compulsion to take an early pension which the Government wish to impose on disabled people is that it will be very expensive. I can only endorse the point made so clearly by my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs, who, if he was not an actuary, certainly has a professional background in pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, in the present circumstances, the proposal comes particularly ill. All those who are nearing retirement and about to take their pension face the problem of falling annuity rates. To force people to take an early pension, in a climate of falling annuity rates, is to double the financial damage imposed on them. The Government are proposing a double blow for disabled people. They will find that their incapacity benefit, to which they are fully entitled by the contribution conditions, and which is already restricted by the previous clause and the all-work test, is reduced. The other aspect of the double whammy is that their pension income will be reduced as well by virtue of their being forced to take it early. That seems an extraordinarily invidious position in which to place people who, through no fault of their own, have had to leave the labour market. They are being penalised in a heartless way by the new Labour Government for doing so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rendel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not it a treble whammy? Some people may have become incapacitated in terms of the job that they have been doing, and have had to leave it. They are then forced to take an early pension when they leave their job, because otherwise they will lose incapacity benefit. Yet those people could, in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0961">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>897</span>
Government's own terms, be looking for other work which they are still able to do later on. Contrary to the Government's claims, they will have a clear disincentive not to take on other work, because they will by that time have had to take their pension early.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is remarkable how the Government manage, particularly in clauses 51 and 52 that we are considering today, to be at the same time heartless and
	<span class='label label-info column'>898</span>
stupid. In many cases, the effect of their provision are perverse in terms of their stated objectives. The hon. Member for Newbury has made a very good point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the Ministers have thought through this proposal, any more than they have thought through most of the Bill. They have simply taken Treasury instructions. This is a matter that we shall have to go into, because it is relevant to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
