	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Fabricant 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lichfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Welsh. Is it not outrageous that a statutory instrument can be 90 pages long? It is, in effect, a Bill, which should be debated on the Floor of the House. As it is a statutory instrument, will you clarify whether our debating time is limited to 90 minutes or—in the case of Northern Ireland legislation—to two and a half hours? Is that adequate time for parliamentary scrutiny of a document of this size, which has so many clauses?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerald Bermingham 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(St. Helens, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Welsh. Does the new—or semi-new—hon. Gentleman not realise that, in the 1980s, statutory instruments of similar or greater length were frequently considered in Committee? Furthermore, if they were taken on the Floor of the House, they would be debated for only an hour and a half. Unless the hon. Gentleman is unable to comprehend the document's contents, I cannot understand his objection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This proves that these are not points of order but points of debate. It is not a matter for the Chairman. I can confirm, however, that the maximum time for debate is two and a half hours. I will also use this opportunity to give permission for hon. Members to remove their jackets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.32 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. John McFall)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Water (Northern Ireland) Order 1999.</p></blockquote>
The order deals with two main areas: water resources and cleanliness, and water recreation and navigation. It will replace the Water Act (Northern Ireland) 1972 and will also amend the river bye-law making powers in the Laganside Development (Northern Ireland) Order 1989.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part II of the order deals with the powers of the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland to promote the conservation of water resources and the cleanliness of waterways and underground strata. Those powers have been available since 1972, and are now being revised to take account of changes in Government policies, increased public environmental awareness, scientific advances and EC directive requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
The order will introduce a number of new provisions: first, the power to charge fees for discharge consents and abstraction licences; secondly, an improved system for processing applications for discharge consents including powers to hold public inquiries; and thirdly, the strengthening of pollution prevention measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The powers of the Department of the Environment to combat water pollution will be extended by article 12 to enable enforcement notices to be served. These can specify the remedial action to be taken by a person holding a discharge consent to ensure compliance with consent conditions. At present, a discharger can be prosecuted in the courts for failure to meet consent conditions but the Department has no power to require particular improvements to be carried out. Article 14 extends the Department's powers to make regulations to prevent water pollution by, for example, agriculture or industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of Northern Ireland's ample natural supplies of water, it has not been considered necessary to use the powers in the 1972 Act to make water abstraction regulations. The need for such regulations is currently under review. Further consultations would be carried out on any proposals for abstraction or impounding regulations. The opportunity has been taken to revise the existing powers, and article 20 provides for the control of impounding works as well as water abstraction. It also provides for local inquiries and appeals and for regulations to contain provisions for the protection of existing rights or interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 17 contains new powers for the Department to serve notices for anti-pollution works and operations. Such a notice would be served on a person who is responsible for a water pollution incident and would require works to be carried out to remove the polluting matter or to mitigate the effects of the pollution. An anti-pollution works notice could also be served to require measures to prevent polluting matter entering a waterway or underground strata. Article 19 provides for a person served with a works notice to have access to land in order to carry out the anti-pollution measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department of the Environment maintains a public register of discharge consents, but article 30 requires the information on the register to be extended to include details of the classification and the quality of waterways, applications for discharge consents and the associated decisions, the results of the analyses of effluent samples, the steps taken in consequence, enforcement notices and works notices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order recognises an increasing demand for water-based tourism from local residents and foreign visitors attracted by the cruising, angling and recreational possibilities on Northern Ireland's waterways. Under the Water Act 1972 the Department of Agriculture's powers to promote the recreational use of waterways are limited to minor works, but under articles 41 to 45 the Department will be able to carry out a wider range of projects to improve and restore waterways for recreational and navigational use. Article 48 provides powers to acquire land by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0398">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
agreement or vesting. Such works would be subject, to the availability of finances. That will be a big issue in view of the major capital costs of canal regeneration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 46 enables the Department to enter into arrangements with other bodies or persons who may be able to draw on private finance or grant from sources such as the national lottery or European Community programmes. To meet EC obligations in the case of an inland waterway restoration project, there will be a requirement to undertake an environmental assessment of the effects of the restoration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under article 47, the Department will be able to cooperate with authorities in the Republic of Ireland on a waterway scheme. The powers are in line with those available under the drainage order in relation to Lough Erne, allowing the successful joint restoration of the Shannon-Erne waterway in 1994.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the expansion of the demand for water-based recreation, there is a need for better regulation to provide for the safety of users and to reconcile potentially conflicting activities. Article 49 extends the Department's powers to regulate the recreational and navigational use of waterways. To meet the cost of providing an improve service on waterways, article 50 will enable charges to be levied for the use of facilities and the licensing of craft.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order will contribute to the Government's sustainable development policies by strengthening powers to combat water pollution and conserve water resources. It will promote the recreational use of canals and other waterways. The order will facilitate the transfer of certain functions to the new Northern Ireland Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure and the cross-border inland waterways implementation body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.38 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Moss 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Cambridgeshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Member for Lichfield (Mr. Fabricant) said on a point of order, the order is a substantial document dealing with the matters that the Minister described. Parts I and II of the order relate to the Department of the Environment and part III relates to the Department of Agriculture. However, the Minister did not tell the Committee two things. First, why is the order necessary now, in view of our hopes that there will be devolution, if not in a few weeks' time, certainly in a few months' time? This is rightly a devolved power that will go to the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the new politicians in that Assembly will have every right to decide how they wish to take accord. Will the Minister therefore tell us why the order has been introduced, at this juncture?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should not digress too much from the order before us today, but five orders are under consideration this week alone. It is as if the Northern Ireland Office has suddenly woken up to a raft of legislation that it wishes to push through before devolution. Why is that necessary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend think it too cynical of me to suggest that the Department fears that the devolution process is not going smoothly and that to wait for devolved powers to come into place may be a wait too long?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that Mr. Moss will resist temptation and stick to the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly stick to the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend's question brings me to my second point. The Minister did not say that the order, although worth while, will significantly alter the Water Act (Northern Ireland) 1972. There is the odd important provision, but nothing to support the suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for Lichfield that it needs to be railroaded through before devolution. That is not the point. It makes no great change to current legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order does, however, beef up the enforcement section, which I will cover later, and part III gives new powers to the Department of Agriculture—at least I think that they are new powers; schedule 8 does not appear to repeal legislation in relation to part III. Does the order create new legislation relating to waterways, canals and their use, especially for recreational purposes, or transfer a power or responsibility from another Department of State in Northern Ireland to the Department of Agiculture?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to specific matters, article 4 of part I refers to the functions of the Department of the Environment. That also covers the duties of the Environment and Heritage Service which, as a non-departmental public body, is part of the Department's responsibility. The first duty set out in article 4 is to promote conservation and cleanliness of water resources. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Department shall … promote the conservation of water resources of Northern Ireland"</p></blockquote>
and
	<br><blockquote><p>"promote the cleanliness of water in waterways and underground strata."</p></blockquote>
Paragraph (2) states that the Department will
	<br><blockquote><p>"have regard to … the protection of public health".</p></blockquote>
That brings us to the difficult problem of the relationship between the Department of the Environment as the overarching body and the two non-departmental public bodies, the Environment and Heritage Service and the Water Service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the responsibility of the Water Service to provide drinking water of a quality that matches the standard set in European legislation and to discharge effluence from its sewage treatment plants, which also have to meet stringent European standards. It is also responsible for water quality in the sea off the shores of Northern Ireland and, in particular, off the main bathing beaches. The Water Service is, therefore, responsible for public health through the quality of the water that it provides, but its responsibilities overlap with those of another part of the Department. The Minister should clarify the demarcation between the duties of the Environment and Heritage Service and those of the Water Service. What legislation covers the quality of drinking water in pipes and taps? The order
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0399">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
does not seem to cover that, but the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland is responsible for the cleanliness of water and its public health aspects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When a friend of mine, Peter Lacey, became head of the health service for the state of Queensland, Australia and there was some minor poisoning of the water due to local flooding in northwest Queensland, he decided to determine what regulations covered water quality. He discovered that they went back to the 19th century and simply required the water supply to be potable. Can the Minister say what regulations cover Northern Ireland and confirm that there are no strange anomalies whereby Northern Ireland, unlike the remainder of the United Kingdom, has more clearly defined water regulations, just as Queensland's water regulations were non-existent compared with those of New South Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not tempted to go to Queensland, but the point follows on from what I was saying. Can the Minister clearly demarcate between the responsibilities of the Water Service and those of the Environment and Heritage Service in relation to quality, not just of drinking water through the taps, but concerning the public health liability?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 5(1) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Department may, in relation to any description of waters … by regulations prescribe a system of classifying the quality of those waters".</p></blockquote>
That is fine. We all hope and expect that the Department has stringent objectives for water quality, but the order does not state whether those requirements and regulations will have some commonality with those pertaining to the remainder of the United Kingdom. It would be unacceptable if Northern Ireland had different standards from those pertaining to water quality in Scotland, England and Wales. The order does not state that those standards should comply also with European Union regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 7 deals with the pollution of water courses. That will be policed by the Environment and Heritage Service. Some of the pollution is from effluent discharge from the sewerage plants operated by the Water Service. We have already established that that comes under another section of the Department of the Environment. I know from experience that there were examples—not numerous but more than I cared to have to own up to when I was a Minister—of water services being the main culprit in polluting water courses, which another section within the same Department was supposed to be policing. How can a Department act as poacher and gamekeeper on water quality?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was alluded to in the paper on water and sewerage services in Northern Ireland, which was published by Lord Dubs, the Under-Secretary of State with responsiblity for the environment in Northern Ireland last November. He referred in his opening comments to the problem of the Department having to face both ways. One section of the Department is responsible for sewerage effluent, which sometimes causes severe pollution and large fish kills. Let us not
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
beat about the bush, there have been some serious incidents. Yet the same Department, wearing a different hat, is supposed not only to police but to enforce water quality. I presume that water services are still under the remit and control of the Department of the Environment and that, if devolution comes about and the Department is reorganised, the Water Service will remain within its remit. Perhaps the Minister will confirm or deny that. Has one side of the Department ever taken the other side to court, or does Crown immunity apply in those circumstances? If there is Crown immunity, how long does the Minister believe that it should remain, given the seriousness of the incidents?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 11 deals with the power to make a scheme of charges, particularly in relation to discharge consents. Article 11(1) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Department may require the payment to it of such charges as may be specified".</p></blockquote>
Therefore, the Department is introducing charges for discharge consents. I presume that schemes for payment already exist. If not, I hope that the Minister will clarify that. Again, is there parity with the rest of Great Britain in regard to the payment of charges for discharge consent?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 12 deals with enforcement notices, to which the Minister referred in more detail in his opening remarks. It has been a bone of contention over the years that, even when perpetrators of pollution were identified, the Government did not seem to have the teeth either to enforce convictions or to extract a reasonable penalty. I think that the Minister said that the Government perceived that to be the case and that article 12 is not only new, but provides much more powerful, beefed-up enforcement than existed in the past. I believe that to be the case, but I should like the Minister to confirm it. Certainly under article 12(3)(a) a conviction on indictment could be
	<br><blockquote><p>"imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to a fine or to both".</p></blockquote>
Perhaps, for the first time, there are serious enforcement provisions in the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 16, which deals with anti-pollution works and operations, gives the Department power to carry out any works that it deems necessary in relation to problems associated with pollution—disposing of matter polluting water courses and the rest of it. Article 16(1) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Department shall be entitled to carry out investigations for the purpose of establishing the source of the matter and the identity of the person who has caused or permitted, whether knowingly or otherwise, the matter to be present in relevant waters".</p></blockquote>
Who will conduct those investigations? Only when I read the consultation paper did I realise that in many cases the Water Service is doing the monitoring on behalf of the Environment and Heritage Service. I am not saying that the waters are muddy, but the responsibilities of one part of the service certainly overlap with those of another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister confirm that monitoring and, often, investigation of pollution is carried out by the Water Service? At what stage, if at all, is an
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0400">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
independent body called in? In the past, concerns have been publicly expressed that matters arising from certain investigations were not examined in sufficient detail. The words, "cover up" were used by some to indicate that they were less than happy with the outcome of certain reports. I do not believe that either branch of the Department has ever shortchanged society in Northern Ireland by terminating or improperly conducting investigations. However, it is not surprising that the public sometimes question the veracity of the findings, given that two branches of the same Department are involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 17 deals with
	<br><blockquote><p>"Notices requiring persons to carry out anti-pollution works and operations",</p></blockquote>
and will enable the Department to serve a works notice on a person or persons who cause pollution. Is the provision new, or have the works notices to which paragraph (2) refers been issued in the past? If so, how frequently have they been issued?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 20, which deals with the abstraction and impounding of water, again impinges on the responsibility of the Water Service, which provides drinking water and constructs and operates dams. The matter is covered in article 20(1)(b), which refers to "impounding works". Impounding works for which the Water Service is responsible will therefore be regulated by the Environment and Heritage service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 20(2) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Regulations under paragraph (1) shall not apply to a person who … holds a licence under Article 10(1)(a) of the Electricity (Northern Ireland) Order 1992".</p></blockquote>
Will the order, or some other legislation, require the Water Service to hold a licence before it can abstract water from rivers or, for example, from Lough Neagh, where a huge abstraction serves many consumers in Northern Ireland? I suspect that, as a Crown body, the Water Service will not need such a licence. Will the Minister confirm that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part III, which is entitled
	<br><blockquote><p>"Powers of the Department of Agriculture in Relation to Waterways",</p></blockquote>
deals with what I believe are new powers granted to the Department of Agriculture. Article 2(2) states that a waterway
	<br><blockquote><p>"includes any river, stream, watercourse, inland water … or tidal waters and any channel or passage of whatever kind … through which water flows".</p></blockquote>
A number of exceptions are then given. I thought that that paragraph gave the Department of Agriculture powers over canals and man-made waterways. However, the definition also includes rivers, streams and water courses. What happens when a conflict of interest arises? Article 41 gives the Department the power to
	<br><blockquote><p>"execute and maintain such works, including the dredging and maintenance of channels and the provision and maintenance of aids to navigation".</p></blockquote>
I can understand why that power has been given for waterways such as canals, which have recreational uses involving boats, but how does it apply to rivers that are subject to conflicts of interest between water services that extract from the rivers, local farmers who have abstraction rights for irrigation purposes—given
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
Northern Ireland's rainfall, I cannot believe that there are many—and the rights of riparian users such as fishermen?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order is not specific about arbitration in relation to conflicts or interest. Problems might arise where a Department has powers to dredge and clear channels for boats—which is to be applauded in certain situations—and other users have completely different interests. Will the Minister clarify what arbitration would occur in that situation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The mere fact that it may have happened in the 1980s—and in the 1970s—does not make it right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Article 7(3) on page 13 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a person is charged with an offence under paragraph (1) it shall be a defence to prove that he exercised all reasonable care to prevent the discharge".</p></blockquote>
How many times can that defence be used? I assume that it is a defence for the first time that an act of pollution occurs, but what if the same thing were to happen on consecutive days? Would that be a matter for the court?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire 	<i>(Mr. Moss)</i> raised several issues to which I shall refer. First, he referred to pollution caused by a part of the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland. It has always been a bone of contention among Members representing Northern Ireland that the Department has no gamekeeper to call it to account when a problem has been caused by the Department. One thing that has always puzzled me is who is responsible when pollution is caused by the Department. Article 7(7) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A person guilty of an offence under this Article shall be liable—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(a) on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for … 2 years".</p></blockquote>
Who in the Department would be liable to be found guilty and given two years? Two years for pollution when there is an amnesty in other respects in Northern Ireland seems a bit harsh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0401">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
I stress the problem caused to fishermen by pollution. It applies not only to the Department in its various guises, whether it is looking after the water or other matters; there are also firms that unfortunately cause pollution. Again unfortunately, the full rigour of the order does not seem to apply to those firms. That was one reason why I asked what would happen if a firm that caused pollution said as a a defence that it had taken reasonable care, but the pollution occurred again six months later. The order does not seem to have much power to deal with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference is made to whether the new powers will be transferred to the new Assembly when it is up and running, if there is a new Assembly. I cannot speak for all the members of the Assembly, but I would imagine that there will be a view that an overall body should oversee the different Departments, so that pollution or other problems will be looked at by an independent body. We shall wait and see whether that happens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 20(a) says an electricity body in Northern Ireland, which
	<br><blockquote><p>"holds a licence under Article 10(1)(a) of the Electricity (Northern Ireland) Order 1992"</p></blockquote>
is not covered by the article. What are the reasons for that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall have to read article 33(2) to explain my next question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This Article does not apply to any waterway of a description specified in an order made by the Department subject to negative resolution."</p></blockquote>
Perhaps the Minister can explain to me, if not to the Committee, what that means. I hope that his colleagues have made a note of that and will give him an explanation. I am not sure that they have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 58(3) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Water Council shall be appointed by the Heads of the Departments and shall consist of not more than 15 persons each of whom shall… hold office"</p></blockquote>
and so on. The article goes on to say that the heads of the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Environment will decide who to appoint as members of the Water Council. If they disagree on the composition, who will be the arbiter? Who will decide which head of Department is correct? The same applies to the appointment of the chairman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may seem a simple matter, but such considerations are important in Northern Ireland where everyone will examine who is appointed as chairman. The two heads of Department will—rightly, under the article—get together decide on the chairman. If there is a disagreement—and we occasionally have disagreements in Northern Ireland, even about football—what will happen?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the head of Department of Agriculture is a member of Sinn Fein and the head of the Department of the Environment is a member of the Ulster Unionists, will they talk to each other?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I welcome the order. I expect the penalties to be used sparingly, but waterways and water in Northern Ireland need to be protected because they are valuable assets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.13 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Notwithstanding the comments of my chum, my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire, and the hon. Member for South Antrim (Mr. Forsythe) on how long such legislation has been dealt with as a statutory instrument, I hope that after 30 years devolution will be successful and that Stormont will succeed, so that similar legislation can be discussed in Committee in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I broadly welcome the order. It appears to be to the good of the people of Northern Ireland, which is rich in many resources, including water. The Minister said that there will be no regulation governing water extraction. Is the water table sufficiently consistent—and will it continue to be so—that there does not need to be some control over water extraction? If there is not, the water table may be lowered locally, which can cause buildings to subside and foundations to dry out, and that can be extremely expensive to home owners and businesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the fact that the order will promote waterways. The explanatory notes state that the order will enable the Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland to undertake or to facilitate a wider range of water recreation or inland navigation projects. The Minister, who comes from Dumbarton, may know about the project to link Edinburgh and Glasgow with a canal—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will run through my constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that it will run through his constituency. I hope at some stage to navigate through his constituency on that canal, and to visit some of the watering holes en route. The canal will attract even more tourism to Scotland. Will the Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland liaise with whichever Department in Northern Ireland is responsible for promoting tourism to ensure that canals that are developed are promoted in the United Kingdom and throughout the world? The Government have cut back considerably the budget of the British Tourist Authority, whose job includes the promotion of tourism in Northern Ireland and in Great Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Businesses can take advantage of inland waterways by supplying canal boats for hire, but to what extent are they doing so? What is the Minister doing to ensure that such firms are set up in Northern Ireland? There are already some, but perhaps not enough to take advantage of all the tourist activity on the many new canals.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0402">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
Article 11 refers to a scheme of charges. The explanatory notes say that that article will enable the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland to make a scheme of charges for applications for discharge consents and for annual subsidence charges. I mentioned that earlier in relation to water extraction. Article 11 contrasts with part 5 of the explanatory notes, which deals with compliance cost assessments. It categorically states that proposals from the Department of Agriculture—not the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland—have no impact on business, and that a compliance cost assessment is unnecessary. I have examined part 5 carefully, but I see no mention of a compliance cost assessment for the Department of the Environment. If a scheme of charges will be introduced, businesses will surely incur costs. How does the Minister reconcile those statements?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order is a step forward for tourism in Northern Ireland I hope that statutory instruments of a similar size will no longer be brought before the House—they should be dealt with under regulations that will be introduced by the new Government in Stormont. I hope that the establishment of that new Government will promote tourism in Northern Ireland. I have no doubt that Northern Ireland is an attractive place to visit. I used to visit it a lot, when I worked for the BBC for a very short while in the early 1970s. It is a myth in the House that I was a broadcaster for many years. I was a business man for many years before I came into the House, but I worked for the BBC for a short while in the early 1970s in Northern Ireland.

Northern Ireland is a beautiful Province—the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Helen Jackson) appears to disagree, I do not know why. Perhaps she is disagreeing with something else that I have said. However, there can be no doubt that many people are deterred from visiting Northern Ireland, simply because of the troubles there. However, I also know people who are deterred from visiting Britain because the occasional bomb has gone off in London. They think that because a bomb went off in London a few years ago, it is therefore unsafe to visit not only London, but other parts of the United Kingdom. It is the same in Israel, when the occasional—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
The hon. Member for Lichfield mentioned the length of the order, and the short time that we have in which to debate it. I fully agree. The hon. Member for South Antrim spoke of his lengthy service on delegated legislation. I am sure that I can satisfy both hon. Members by telling them that incidents such as this will soon not take place here; they will be a matter for the new Northern Ireland Assembly. I presume that the two hon. Members will agree with me on that, and will wish God speed—as was mentioned—to the new Assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire mentioned the number of orders under consideration this week. I think that four of the five orders were needed to effect changes in the law to provide for devolution, so we must be ready for that. Part III of this order provides the necessary powers to facilitate cross-border co-operation on inland waterways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also mentioned the issue of the order being, as he termed it, pushed through now. The Water (Northern Ireland) Order was published in draft form for public consultation in May 1998. It was expected to go through Parliament in autumn 1998, but it was delayed because of pressure on the timetable from the devolution legislation. It is going through now because time is available. The hon. Gentleman made 16 or 17 points. If he will bear with me, I shall try to go through them with him. If any Committee Member is not satisfied with the detail of my response, I shall be delighted to write to him. The hon. Member for Lichfield knows that, when I say that I will write, I do—as I have done in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire asked why Northern Ireland did not have an independent environmental protection agency. The Environment and Heritage Service was established, as he knows, on 1 April 1996. The hon. Gentleman, as a former Minister, was very much involved in that and I pay tribute to the work that he did. The service has the same responsibility for integrating pollution control and discharges to waterways as environmental agencies do in Great Britain. The Waste and Contaminated Land (Northern Ireland) Order 1997 contains powers to transfer the waste-licensing functions of the district councils to the Department, and they will be exercised by the service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked how the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland can act as both the supplier of drinking water and the regulator of its quality. He will know that a drinking water inspectorate has been established by the Environment and Heritage Service to assess the public drinking water supplied by the Water Service for compliance with the standards in the Water Quality Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1994. The regulations implement the EC drinking water directive. The drinking water inspector has published a report on the quality of supplies. The chief executives of the Water Service and the Environment and Heritage Service are separately accountable to the Minister and to Parliament. I am satisfied that those regulatory arrangements function satisfactorily.

	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
The hon. Member for Lichfield referred to Queensland. I think that his point related to whether the Department could act as both supplier and regulator of the quality of its service. My answer to the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire covered that point. The inspectorate assesses the water supply through the Water Service for compliance with the water quality regulations, which implement the EC drinking water directive. There is a report by the drinking water inspectorate on the quality of supplies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have gone some way towards answering the hon. Gentleman's questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My specific question was as follows: I was saying that there is variation in Australia and I was worried that there might be variation in the United Kingdom. Whereas in New South Wales, as in England, there are clear definitions of potable water—that is to say, the amount of contaminants per litre, bacterial and mineral contamination, and so on, and it is clearly defined by mineral and by types of bacterium—in Queensland there is no such definition: it simply says that the water shall be potable. I want an assurance that in Northern Ireland there is a clear definition of what makes water potable—what the limits are—just as there is in England.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will realise that it is beyond me to go into that precise detail. The chief executives of the Water Service and Environment and Heritage Service are separately accountable to the Minister and to Parliament. I am satisfied that the regulatory arrangements function well. I shall look into that further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister is to write to me on that mattter, will he also confirm that the standards in Northern Ireland are the same as in England or at least no worse than in England?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can answer that straight away. The Northern Ireland water regulations are the same as in England. Does the hon. Gentleman still wish me to write to him?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has given the Committee an assurance that the present arrangements are working well. Yet on page 23 of the consultation paper issued by Lord Dubs, the section entitled "Organisational Structures", which covers the public sector ownership and arrangements, including the current agency arrangements, says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The existing agency arrangement has the benefit of guaranteeing close political control of these essential public services."</p></blockquote>
We agree with that, in terms of the Department having control over them. It continues "However"—and this is the salient point—
	<br><blockquote><p>"this option is difficult to sustain because of the desirability of having greater separation between the environmental regulator and the service provider."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
Therefore, in their own document the Government are now moving towards separating the two functions and considering several alternatives. The Minister could have responded by saying that he accepted the present difficulty, but that, through the consultation paper, he is looking to make changes in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend accepted that there were difficulties. That was the reason for the consultation paper. We shall consider the responses of the hon. Gentleman and others and formulate proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to the Department being both the gamekeeper and poacher and I shall respond to that point later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked how the order would facilitate the transfer of functions covering inland waterways on devolution. The order largely incorporates in one measure the powers to develop and regulate inland waterways for navigation and water recreation. It also provides more extensive powers to undertake works in relation to canal restoration. It recognises the need for cross-border co-operation on canal regeneration projects—for example, the Ulster canal, which was recently the subject of a feasibility study—and provides for such co-operation on restoration projects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On policing, the hon. Gentleman asked whether we were satisfied that the Water Service was properly regulated. The Environment and Heritage Service has discharge standards set for 134 of the largest waste water treatment works which treat the sewage from more than 94 per cent, of the seweraged population of Northern Ireland. Existing standards for smaller works are being reviewed progressively and standards have been set for the 25 water treatment plants which make a discharge to the environment. Work is also progressing on the setting of standards for all remaining discharges, including storm overflows and other intermittent discharges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Registered discharge standards and compliance monitoring results are available on a public register. Water Service discharges are also subject to control under the Urban Waste Water Treatment Regulations (NI) 1995 and standards for the first 15 sewage treatment works to come under the scope of the regulations are being reveiwed with effect from 1 January 1998.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman went on to ask about the requirement for water quality to be in line with British standards and EC directives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already replied to that question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to article 7 and asked whether the Water Service will be liable to prosecution under the order for water pollution from its sewerage or water treatment works. The Water Service, as part of a Government Department, has Crown immunity and cannot be prosecuted under the order for the offence of water pollution. However, the consultation paper to which he referred, and which was launched last year, included options for the new structures for the Water Service that could result in it becoming a public body outside central Government and open to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0404">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
legal proceedings under the order. After devolution, that will be a matter for the Northern Ireland Assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked whether water recreation and navigation were new responsibilities. They are not new powers transferred to the Department of Agriculture. The Department has had functions in relation to water recreation and navigation under previous legislation. On devolution, the functions covering water recreation and navigation will pass from the Department of Agriculture to the new Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure and those covering certain waterways will pass to the cross-border implementation body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is attempting to answer my question concerning part III of the order, which gives to the Department of Agriculture powers in relation to waterways, recreation and so on. Schedule 8 lists the earlier legislation that will be repealed and part II states that the whole of the Water Act (Northern Ireland) Act 1972 will be repealed, but in relation to part III there is nothing to suggest any repeals to existing legislation. If part III were entirely new, there would be no repeals. I am curious to know why no Acts are repealed or changed in relation to the powers conferred on the Department of Agriculture in part III.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note the hon. Gentleman's comments and will return to them later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to article 16 and asked whether the Department monitors and investigates pollution incidents. The Environment and Heritage Service investigates pollution incidents and related services, and carries out audit checks on discharges from Water Service treatment works. All pollution incidents are carefully and thoroughly investigated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire asked about notice to carry out anti-pollution works under article 17. It is a new procedure and will be similar to that governing the rest of the United Kingdom. He also asked about fines. Article 12 states that the maximum fine for a pollution offence will be £20,000—the same as in the rest of the United Kingdom. The precise level of fines and costs will be a matter for the courts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of clarification. I asked whether article 12 constituted completely new legislation that would increase the range of fines and sentences available to the courts in respect of pollution incidents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I shall clarify matters if my explanation was a bit hazy. The order will update legislation in Northern Ireland to bring it into line with legislation in England and Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bermingham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for leaving the Committee but I had to make an urgent telephone call.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the subject of fines, a comment from the Opposition Benches raised an interesting thought. If we are calling for corporate liability, as indeed we should, which representative of a given corporation
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
will be liable to a prison sentence? I raise the subject in the light of Zeebrugge, the Marchioness, British Rail, the Clapham omnibus company, and so on. We have often talked about corporate liability, but we never seem to pin it down. Is not this a wonderful opportunity to set a precedent by pinning liability on, for example, the director or the secretary of a corporation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, South for his question, but I cannot answer it completely. The problem, which, as he knows, has been a thorny one over the years, is certainly not covered by the order. I take his point, but we would prefer to learn from the experience of others on that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for giving way—I like to think that my interventions are occasionally helpful. Under the Companies Act, the law in England and Wales provides that directors, or those who are seen to be directors, are generally responsible for actions that contravene company law or criminal law. I see that my chum, the hon. Member for St. Helens, South, is shaking his head in dissent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, South has wide experience of the courts and I defer to him on the matter. As I said, the order will not alter the precise level of fines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In respect of article 20, the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire asked whether the Water Service will require a licence to impound water. The answer is no. Abstraction and impounding of water by the Water Service for public supply is controlled under the Water and Sewerage Services (Northern Ireland) Order 1973. Article 20 of the present order will not affect the Water Service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Articles 20 and 21, which covers water abstraction, will not apply to the Water Service. Under the Water and Sewerage Services (Northern Ireland) Order 1973, the Water Service has a statutory obligation to give notice to abstract water. In the event of a dispute, the water appeals commission may take a decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire also asked what would happen in the event of a conflict of interest in relation to works on waterways. Works undertaken for recreational or navigational purposes will be subject to wide consultation through the environmental impact assessment, which will identify effects on interests and should help to resolve conflicts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that the water appeals commission will have the final say, or will it devolve on the Environment and Heritage Service, which will presumably be involved in the environmental impact assessment? Who, in the final analysis, makes the decision to say yes or no to a proposal from the Department of Agriculture in relation to the improvement of waterways?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I write to the hon. Gentleman on that point? I thank him for his interest.

The hon. Member for South Antrim asked how many times the defence of "all reasonable care" can be used. Words such as "reasonable" are often debated, but I must refer the hon. Gentleman to the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also referred to a pollution offence by the Water Service. Article 7 does not apply to the Water Service, which has Crown immunity. However, as I said earlier with regard to the consultation paper, there are ways of making a public body accountable. Again, that would be a matter for the Assembly.

The hon. Member for South Antrim asked why Northern Ireland does not have an independent environmental protection agency to oversee pollution issues. The Environment and Heritage Service has the same responsibility for integrated pollution control and discharges to waterways as environmental agencies do in Great Britain. The Waste and Contaminated Land (Northern Ireland) Order 1997 contains powers to transfer the waste-licensing functions of the district councils to the Department, and they will be exercised by the service. The Government believe that it is too early in the life of the EHS to contemplate radical change, but again that could be attended to after devolution.

The hon. Member for South Antrim also asked who would be the arbitrator if the heads of the Department of the Environment and the Department of Agriculture disagreed about the appointment of a water commissioner. If there is a disagreement, the Minister will decide.

The abstraction licence for an electricity company is not required for article 20. An electricity company mentioned in article 20(2) must get a licence from the Department to abstract water. The procedures will be similar to the measures required under the order. He also asked about article 33(2) and the negative resolution. There is a laid-down procedure for the making of statutory rules for Northern Ireland, which is similar to the statutory instruments that apply to the rest of the United Kingdom.

In an intervention the hon. Member for Lichfield asked whether it would be necessary to have abstraction controls. The powers in the 1972 Act to make regulations to contol water abstraction have never been invoked because of Northern Ireland's
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
abundant natural supplies of water. If the hon. Gentleman had been with me in Belfast over the last few days, he probably would not have asked that question. The opportunity has now been taken to revise the existing powers and draft article 20 to provide for the control of impounding works as well as water abstraction. It also provides for fees for local inquiries and appeals, and for regulations to contain provisions for the protection of existing rights or interests. The need for abstraction and impounding regulations is also kept under review.

The hon. Member for Lichfield also asked about tourism and canals. He will be aware of the great success of the Shannon-Erne waterway, created in 1994 inder the previous Government. It made more money on its first day than it did in its whole working life before it fell into disuse. He also mentioned the Forth-Clyde canal in my constituency. We hope to increase tourism to give pleasure to many people and to help the environment. I am with the hon. Gentleman all the way on that.

The hon. Gentleman asked why a compliance cost assessment was unnecessary in respect of Department of Agriculture functions. It was considered that the modest charging proposals for inland waterways would have little impact on business, although they could affect private individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also mentioned tourism and the hire of canal boats. The Northern Ireland tourism industry has been held back for many years, as the hon. Gentleman knows, by the troubles. A month or two ago an American visitor who had been coming to Ireland for the past 25 years decided to visit Belfast for the first time. That is indicative of the problems that we have experienced over the past 30 years, but it is also interesting that someone so set in his ways should decide to come to Northern Ireland as a tourist. With the increasing development of tourism, activities such as the hiring of canal boats will take off.
