Value Added Tax (Abolition of Zero-Rating for Tax-Free Shops) Order 1999 (S.I., 1999, No. 1642)</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As it is warm in the Committee, hon. Members may remove their jackets, if they wish.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Value Added Tax (Abolition of Zero-Rating for Tax-Free Shops) Order 1999 (S.I., 1999, No. 1642).</p></blockquote>
Hon. Members will know that, until yesterday, passengers on sea crossings or flights between European Union member states were able to buy duty-free goods at duty-free shops or on board ships and aircraft, and bring them into the United Kingdom without paying value added tax or excise duty. There were limits on the quantities passengers could bring in. The availability of duty-free goods on journeys within the European Union ended at midnight on 30 June. That decision was taken not by this Government, although we were required to implement it, but by the previous Government. In 1991, the previous Government agreed in a unanimous vote with other European Union member states that duty-free sales should end on 30 June 1999. It must then have seemed a long way in the future, but there is no evidence that the previous Government gave any further thought to the consequences of that decision, between 1991 and the change of Government in May 1997.<br><br>
The Government never changed their mind on the principle of abolition—duty-free sales have no place in an open single market—but they supported the view expressed by a number of member states, including Germany and France, that there was a case for a limited extension of duty-free sales so that more consideration could be given to the arrangements for a successor regime. That view did not receive unanimous support from member states and the abolition of duty-free sales went ahead. The Government always knew that it would be difficult to overturn that decision because unanimity was required. Many member states took the view that, having taken the decision in 1991 and provided for six and a half or perhaps seven years in which to make preparations for abolition—some member states had undertaken the changes—they were not prepared to re-open the debate.<br><br>
During the past six months, the United Kingdom has successfully pressed the Commission for sensible interpretation of the law and has secured important administrative simplification which will help to make trade in duty-paid goods as straightforward as possible. In seeking a better deal, it was important that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
simplification aimed at keeping the burdens on business to a minimum. Although it is not the subject of our debate, it may be helpful if I give some examples of the simplifications.<br><br>
When an aircraft flies over several countries, it was feared that the duty rate would keep changing, but it does not. Similarly, when ferries merely pass through the territorial waters of a member state without docking, there will be no duty-rate change. Ferries and aircraft do not need to account for duty or claim reimbursement when goods are not available for sale—for example, when entering the territory of a higher-taxing member state. Ferries and aircraft can offset claims for reimbursement of UK duty against separate payments without completing separate forms.<br><br>
We shall debate related issues in the House. A picture was painted of chaos, administrative burdens, impossible journeys for travellers and impossible circumstances in which businesses would have to account for their trade. However, the simplifications played an important role in ensuring that such developments did not occur.<br><br>
Committee members will be aware of press reports about the abolition of duty-free sales. Horrific stories were conjured up: we heard that tens of thousands of jobs would be lost, that shops would be closed and that half the routes between Dover and Calais would be closed because they were no longer viable. Such developments have not occurred for various reasons. For example, Customs and Excise carried out excellent work and had discussions with companies to ensure that the abolition was achieved in the simplest, smoothest way. It did so in an extremely short period. If we had had longer, I am sure that we could have done better. Customs and Excise has said that it will continue to consult with the trade and to monitor the operation of the arrangements.<br><br>
Should enormous difficulties arise, we shall deal with them and, if necessary, attempt to persuade the Commission t o change the relevant legislation. I pay tribute to Customs and Excise and to the trade—at least for its role behind the scenes, if not for its public stance—for securing sensible discussions.<br><br>
Committee members may be concerned about the order's effect on the travelling public. What difference will passengers see? In every port and airport and at every departure point Customs and Excise has distributed leaflets that clearly explain what will happen, and staff are constantly on hand to assist traders. The sophisticated computerised tills that sales outlets use are perfectly capable of dealing with the new arrangements—indeed, they are doing so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Sydney Chapman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Chipping Barnet)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a technical but important question for the Paymaster General. She explained that the abolition of the duty-free concession ended at midnight last night. The order is due to come into force today. Has the order already come into force or will it come into force if we pass it? What position are the duty-free shops in at this moment? For example, can they not be charged VAT until the order is passed?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0466">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: VAT and the excise duty are being charged, because the traders have agreed to use the successor regime now in place, which we will debate on the Floor of the House next week. Those provisions enact the abolitions from one minute past midnight. The timing of our deliberations on the order today does not affect in law the point at which VAT becomes liable.<br><br>
However, Customs has agreed with traders—for example, the shops at Heathrow, Gatwick and other airports—that already have stock in their shops that they will be treated as warehouses for tax purposes. As they sell those goods, the duty and the VAT will be applied; they will not have to account for the duty now on stock for which such accounting would not have been necessary before 30 June.<br><br>
We shall monitor that position carefully. We have proposed a three-month period for this, because that is the wind-down period in the legislation for warehouses of that type. However, the turnover of the traders is such that it will probably not take three months to exhaust that existing stock. I have read in the newspapers that, such is the desire of people to shop while waiting for planes, that the shopping facilities at Gatwick airport are to he expanded considerably.<br><br>
That leads me to the welcome, if surprising, announcement from the British Airports Authority that, following the abolition of duty-free sales and the zero rate of VAT, it plans to sell more than 90 per cent. of its products at the pre-abolition price. Customers will, therefore, see little difference in the shops. On aircraft in flight, we have made simplifications to enable goods to be sold from 20 minutes after take-off. Seasoned travellers will know that it takes about 20 minutes for passengers to be allowed to start moving round the aircraft anyway, even though they are dissuaded from so doing.<br><br>
We must make it clear that duty-free sales will continue to exist for passengers travelling to countries outside the European Union. However, as a result of the abolition last night of duty-free sales to passengers travelling within the EU, we are required to make a number of legal changes. We are concerned with one such change today. This statutory instrument simply and specifically implements the VAT aspect of the end of duty frees within the European Union. It removes the zero rate for mobile operators and land-based duty-free shops. It is a simple piece of legislation, and no further VAT changes are needed to implement the replacement regime of Vat.<br><br>
The withdrawal of the zero rate of VAT means that the basic rules for VAT now apply. Land-based shops, such as those at airports, will now have to account for VAT on sales to intra-Community travellers in exactly the same way as high street shops. High street shops cope with that, and I do not believe that it will prove an insurmountable problem for sophisticated outlets such as land-based shops.<br><br>
The specific legislative changes are contained in the reference to zero-rate group 14 in part I of schedule 8 of the Value Added Tax Act 1994; the zero-rate group 14
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
itself, in part II of schedule 8 of the 1994 Act; and the Value Added Tax (Tax Free Shops) Order 1995, which amended group 14.<br><br>
VAT-free sales will still be made available to passengers travelling to third countries. Such sales are covered by other legislation, so there is no need for this statutory instrument to make further qualification.<br><br>
Together with the Excise Goods (Personal Reliefs) (Amendment) Order 1999, which was discussed earlier in the week, the two statutory instruments give effect in UK law to changes in European legislation that were agreed in 1991 by all member states. However, as I said, Customs will continue to work closely with the trade to ensure that the successor regime works well. We will be able further to tweak or amend the provision, should that prove necessary. Should that require a return to the Commission to make such changes, we will consider doing so.</span></p>
<p>10.17 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oliver Letwin <span class='memberconstituency'>(West Dorset)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a horrifying experience to be under your chairmanship, Sir David, as a former Conservative party Whip, but I nevertheless welcome you to the Chair. It is equally horrifying to be surrounded by hon. Friends of infinitely greater distinction than me, whom I hope will contribute to today's debate if they feel so moved.<br><br>
I think that four hon. Members who are present today, including the Paymaster General and me, were also present at the previous debate on the Excise duty order, so I shall not rehearse the issues that were raised then. On inspection, the simplified regime that the Paymaster General eloquently described a moment ago proved likely to degenerate into a complicated farce involving the relationship between intra- and extra-Community duty-free or non-duty-free trade and sales.<br><br>
I shall let that subject be, and we shall see the outcome in due course. During the previous debate, I made some acerbic comments about the drafting of the Excise duty order and its explanatory note. I have no similar comments to make about this order, which is admirably pellucid and needed no explanatory note, although one was provided. Indeed, I could understand the explanatory note as well, I hope that the draftsman of the Excise duty order will derive much instruction from this admirable example.<br><br>
However, that is the end of the good news. I profited by the Paymaster General's statements during the previous debate. Roughly speaking, her logic remains identical: she made a good speech then and a good one today. Her logic is that the miserable previous Government—[HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] Yes, hon. Members should encourage themselves, because they are about to receive some pleasant surprises. Quite unnecessarily, the miserable previous Government acceded to a vote—which required unanimity and could easily have been vetoed—that gave rise to the end of duty free, including VAT, to which I shall come in a moment. The present Government leapt into action on the first day of their accession to power and sought to remedy the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0467">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
ghastly deficiency that they had inherited. However, they were unfortunately defeated by the overwhelming weight of the other members of the European Community, but they have, nevertheless, vouchsafed to us the brilliant successor regime that the Paymaster General has described.<br><br>
That was the logic exposed by the Paymaster General at the time—very beautifully, as always—and re-exposed today in slightly less detail, for which I am grateful. So shocked was I by those revelations that I decided to investigate the whole matter. Various things have become clear to me which, I suppose, as a citizen of the United Kingdom, should have been clear to me at the time, although I was not then a Member of Parliament.<br><br>
So far as I can discern, the European legislation that gave rise to this order is entirely otiose, in that failure to pass it would have had no effect, because lifting the exemption for excise duty would have sufficed to require VAT on those items to be reimposed. That is because, if one refers to the 1977 text of the sixth VAT directive, one can see that the original exemption does not contain any special exemption for duty-free shops. Indeed, the sixth VAT directive would have imposed VAT on duty-free shops which, strictly speaking, came within a category that would have been captured by the directive, except that article 14(d) of the sixth VAT directive provided a loophole—the loophole on which the European Community, including ourselves, rested for some years until 1991. Article 14 (d) of the sixth directive states that one category of exempt goods is,
<br><blockquote><p>"final importation of goods qualifying for exemption from customs duties".</p></blockquote>
In other words, up to the time when the new directive was introduced, items in duty-free shops were not subject to VAT, but only because they were exempt from duties under separate European legislation and, therefore, under separate UK legislation. Therefore, when the situation was regularised by the introduction of article 28k into the new version of the sixth VAT directive, all that happened was that article 14 was rewritten in a clearer form and a specific exemption was included for duty-free shops. Interestingly, the old article 14(d) substantially remains, so, until yesterday, there were two routes by which goods in duty-free shops were exempt from VAT.<br><br>
One of the reasons why this is interesting, at least to some of us, and may even be interesting shortly to Labour Members, is that, for reasons best known to itself—so far as the House of Commons Library and I have been able to determine—this House has never directly debated, in European Standing Committee B or any other European Standing Committee, the removal of the VAT exemption for duty-free shops. When the directive that ostensibly gave rise to this order was brought before the House, the House sublimely ignored it, so no evidence about the attitudes of the parties can be derived from that. However, luckily, that is not the material point.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
The material point was whether excise duty would be imposed after 1999, which would immediately have triggered an imposition of VAT under the original directive. As luck would have it, that was investigated by the House of Commons in European Standing Committee B when the Labour party was in opposition. The Minister's logic that the rotten old previous Administration leapt unnecessarily into accepting the change in law, contrary to the wisdom and foresight of the then Opposition, does not stand up to examination of the record of that Committee's proceedings.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek) was, I think, the shadow Economic Secretary at the time. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I think that the motion, which 'congratulates the Government on negotiating an agreement' is a little OTT. However, I shall not recommend that my hon. Friends vote against the motion."</p></blockquote>
In welcoming the Government's decision to go along with other members of the Community in removing the duty-free exemption on excise duty, he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"If the Government have indeed moved from the stance adopted under the previous Prime Minister"—</p></blockquote>
who was, of course, Lady Thatcher—
<br><blockquote><p>"that is to be welcomed … Harmonisation is also necessary regarding excise duties."—[<i>Official Report, European Standing Committee B,</i> 2 December 1991, c. 15.]</p></blockquote>
He then discussed technical aspects of duty-free goods and excise duty, from which I learned much.<br><br>
My point is self-evident. The Minister alleges that the nasty old Government did these dreadful things, but in fact they were spurred on by the Opposition to accede to the changes which created this saga.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is warming to his theme, but if he reads the proceedings of Tuesday's Committee on the Excise Duties (Personal Reliefs) (Amendment) Order 1999—and, indeed, of this Committee—he will see that I have said that the Government have never changed their mind on the principle of abolition and that duty free sales have no place in a single market. The point is that his Government did did nothing to prepare for that abolition. That is why we face such chaos.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Paymaster General accedes to the proposition that there was a joint endeavour in crime. The record of the previous Committee shows that, in the proper tradition of our party, I conceded that our Government was mistaken, and moved on. I think she tried to suggest subliminally that the previous Government had sole responsibility for the decision. I have merely pointed out that it was a joint decision, which she has accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley <span class='memberconstituency'>(Worthing, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it not the case that the Prime Minister backs Government policy to price cigarettes out of people's reach, but gives the impression in the tabloids that he wants people to continue to buy cheap cigarettes from other countries, which reduces the effect of any action that we take against smoking? People who have access to a train to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0468">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
Europe or a ferry across the North sea or the channel can bring back as many cigarettes as they like, at prices that they can afford, and that ends up killing more people. The Prime Minister refuses to answer questions on that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is—unsurprisingly —right. Had he been present at our previous discussion, he would have heard several of us making the same point. The main issue is smuggling. Tobacco smuggling accounts for £1.7 billion of health-destroying imports, contrary to economic or social rationale. That is the context of these footling little debates. Nevertheless, I wish to continue the footling little debate.<br><br>
The next bit of the Paymaster General's logic was that the previous Government—even if they were only a partner in crime with the Labour party—failed to prepare for what was to happen next. That is not a new observation—the Paymaster General made a similar remark previously—so I investigated Ministers' conduct in debate in the European Council. As she argues one side of the case, the Paymaster General should perhaps be forgiven for not bringing to light something that—if her researchers are as good as I suspect—she will nevertheless acknowledge. Ministers made a sustained attempt to argue for a 10 to 15-year period in which to allow adjustments to occur. Under considerable pressure from other member states, which were supported, I fear, by the then Opposition, the then Government conceded that the period to June 1999 would suffice. I regret that they did so, but there was a partnership in crime.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am fascinated to find out that, unbeknown to the Labour party, there was a coalition Government for 18 years, and shocked because we opposed so many of the previous Government's policies. I was interested to hear the hon. Gentleman's point about the previous Government's negotiating tactics, but he will know that we do not have access to previous Ministers' negotiating stances on matters that have been concluded. We know only the outcome; we do not have access to the detail. I shall be interested to hear the hon. Gentleman explain the previous Government's failure to negotiate in Europe, which, presumably, was caused by their isolation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not surprised to hear the Minister say that, as it is the line that she and her colleagues have followed.<br><br>
To relieve misapprehension, it is not necessary to delve into secret archives to discover such matters, as they were exposed on the Floor of the House by the now Lord Lamont, and can be read in <i>Hansard.</i> The British political establishment unanimously decided not to fight on the issue. When the current Government were elected, the Prime Minister decided that he would like to do something about that—or that is what he said. On the Paymaster General's logic, the Prime Minister's awakening was bizarre. He must have known that, with the complicity of the then Labour Opposition, action was taken that locked in a unanimous cement a series of inevitable progressions that would lead—there was no question of changing them—to the result that occurred last night. It was therefore odd that the Prime Minister suggested, first, that something could be done and,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
secondly, that the Labour party had only just woken up to the situation. His colleagues had been aware of the situation for some time, for the reasons that I suggested.<br><br>
As the Prime Minister would have been acting in good faith, he must genuinely have been under the illusion that his new tactics in the European Union of consensus and, hence, influence—as he fondly hoped—would bring about a change of heart. As the Paymaster General indicated, he believed in the mythology of the previous Government's isolation. To paint that picture fully, one would also have to assume that the Labour Opposition were trying to reverse that isolation. However, isolation was not the issue.<br><br>
Both parts of the British political establishment agreed to capitulate, and a new Prime Minister who believed that he had the capacity to change people's minds discovered, to his astonishment but not mine, that no progress whatever was made.<br><br>
That raises a series of questions, which I hope the Paymaster General will be willing to answer. [HON. MEMBERS: "Ah, the punch line."] I should not want to say that any speech of mine contained a punch line.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Two punch lines, then.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I regard punching anyone—intellectually or otherwise—as a grave accusation. I do, however, want to pose some gentle questions.<br><br>
The first question involves the profound matter of the structure of the proposals, which was raised in another place by the distinguished Labour peer, Lord Shore of Stepney. It is a profoundly shocking experience for anyone to have to sit down and read the sixth VAT directive. Alas, I first did so only during the past 48 hours, when I acquired the dubious honour of speaking for the Opposition on such matters. If Labour Members have a spare afternoon with nothing better to do, I recommend that they read it. My hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet (Sir S. Chapman), who is well acquainted with such matters, already knows that that directive's structure involves an exercise in the most astonishing and unwarranted tyranny.<br><br>
There is no reason why we should be prohibited from exempting, or be compelled to exempt, certain items. Labour Members may be surprised to learn that if the Chancellor, who has a new-found and admirable desire for economic probity, acquired an even more admirable desire for fiscal neutrality and tried to exempt various items from VAT, he would do so in the face of a good deal of democratic opposition and he would be acting illegally. The Community prevents him from exempting such items.<br><br>
Neither Lord Shore nor I have not the slightest idea why the Community should have that power. In another place, Lord Shore asked which article in the European treaties permitted the European authorities to implement the directive, and whether article 5, which deals with subsidiarity, was involved. He received a marvellously blancmange-like answer from Lord McIntosh of Haringey, who simply said that the proposals were
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0469">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
entirely consistent with article 5, but did not offer the slightest explanation. I hope that the matter will be pursued in due course in the European Court of Justice. In the mean time, do the Government accept the entire structure of the sixth VAT directive? Regardless of the legality of the situation, do they believe that it is proper and reasonable for the directive, in its various amended forms, to allow the Community to impose a straitjacket on VAT legislation? The order is merely one small exemption in that context.<br><br>
Secondly, will the Paymaster General place on record the fact that she accepts that the whole episode occurred as a result of the joint efforts of the previous Government and the then Opposition? The Prime Minister must have known about the unanimity rule and about the impossibility of changing the minds of others unless one can change the minds of all. Does she feel the same surprise that I do about the fact that the Prime Minister did not refer to that matter at that time?<br><br>
Finally, and most importantly, does the Paymaster General believe that it will be possible to take any action, either unilaterally or in conjunction with our partners, to remedy the multiple farces that came to light during our previous discussion, and that will be replicated in relation to VAT? We fondly referred to what came to be known as the Casablanca question and the Basel question, among others. For the elucidation of hon. Members who were not present, there is a series of manoeuvres by means of which airlines can ensure that, by taking certain routes, passengers will be able to buy duty free while making a journey that would not normally enable them to do so.<br><br>
A tissue of such farces was brought to light, the details of which are on record. Given this architecture, given that we are so heavily constrained by the terms of the sixth VAT directive and given that the whole issue is locked in concrete by the unanimity rule, does the Paymaster General foresee the possibility of the Government's ironing out, either unilaterally or by agreement, any problems that may arise? She may not wish to accede to there being problems yet, but she must agree that they might occur. If such difficulties could not be ironed out, we should have a serious problem with an architecture that creates a straitjacket for the United Kingdom, and no means of resolving problems caused by measures that have not been well thought through.</span></p>
<p>10.41 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey <span class='memberconstituency'>(Kingston and Surbiton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you to the Chair, Sir David. I also welcome the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) to his position in the Conservative party's Treasury team. I listened to his speech and was surprised that he spent so long making a tiny party political point, rather than saying anything of substance. I appreciate that he has previously taken part in a debate on the excise duty aspect of the abolition of duty free, during which he made some substantive points.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman's speech today seemed rather odd. He suggested that the parties in opposition during the previous Conservative Government were somehow
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
responsible for measures introduced by that Government. He also seemed to suggest, under the influence of the amnesia that he brought to his speech, that the world had stopped in 1997, and that his party's policies were now completely different, with no links to the past. Year zero seemed to have entered his calendar. I know that we are approaching a new millennium, but the Conservative party cannot abrogate responsibility for all their past policies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To follow that line a tiny stage further, will the hon. Gentleman tell us whether any such change of heart by the Conservative party is more or less remarkable than the complete tergiversation of the Labour party on most of its policies, or the propensity of the Liberal Democrats for changing their policies depending on which Liberal Democrat one talks to at any given moment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Tempted as I am to spend some time refuting that rather pointless intervention, I shall move on to discuss the order.<br><br>
The Liberal Democrats have always been in favour of the single market and the promotion of trade and competition. Because of our support for those principles, we believe that any barriers to trade, in the form of taxes or regulations, should be reduced as far as possible. It is, therefore, logical that duty free should go. That view is shared by all parties, which was part of the point that the hon. Gentleman made.<br><br>
However, it does not necessarily follow from that that the implementation of any deregulation or smoothing out of tax differentials is being carried out optimally. It is important to study the effects of the abolition of duty free across the European Union. The hon. Gentleman called for such a post-implementation study, in the Committee that discussed the Excise Duties (Personal Reliefs) (Amendment) Order 1999. The Minister's response was:
<br><blockquote><p>"We are not aware that the European Commission intends to evaluate or revisit the issue."—[<i>Official Report, Eighth Standing Committee on Delegated Legislation,</i> 29 June 1999; c. 18.]</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister ask the European Commission to monitor the effects of the abolition of duty free? That is important, not least because some myths about the potentially damaging effects of the abolition of duty free need to be dispelled. Some anti-Europeans have tried to use abolition as yet another stick with which to beat the EU. Because of the lack of a study prior to the abolition of duty free, we did not have the independently evaluated information with which to fight that argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will recollect that the Government tried to ensure that the Commission completed such a study. Indeed, we were critical about the study's depth, in terms of providing information with which to refute some of the substantial claims that have been made. I said that we would monitor the impact of the abolition of duty free, but should it progress smoothly, it would be a waste of time for the Commission to conduct a study. The Commission has more important things to do than study something that is working well.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0470">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Paymaster General has a point. I am not suggesting that huge resources should be allocated to a major impact study, but facts could be collected relatively cheaply and made public. That would help the case for the EU generally, not least in respect of the single market and the implementation of tax policy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making a serious point. I too accept the Paymaster General's argument that one should not spend money needlessly. However, does the hon. Gentleman agree that there are two reasons why such a study should be conducted? First, as he says, we need to know how the arrangements are working. Secondly, if there are almost no effects whatsoever, even on end prices in duty-free shops, there will be a serious prima facie case for using the Monopolies and Mergers Commission to find out what is happening in ports of entry, where shops were apparently able to regard the duty that they did not pay as premium profit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting point. In considering the abolition of duty free's impact on prices, it would be difficult to ask the question, "What would have happened if?", even if there were an investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission or its European equivalent. An enormous number of factors are involved—from the channel tunnel to the new warehouses that are being built on the other side of the channel to enable economies of pricing scale to be reaped. However, I take the hon. Gentleman's point and welcome his support for a form of study that will not cost huge sums.<br><br>
One point that is germane to the Treasury's monitoring of the system is the extra revenue that Her Majesty's Treasury will hopefully receive. During the previous debate, the Paymaster General made it clear that it was difficult to estimate that revenue. She will know from my previous comments that I accept that, but I hope that some estimate will nevertheless be made, because substantial sums—hundreds of millions of pounds—are involved. If such sums do accrue to the Treasury, we should know about them. I hope that she can assure the Committee that, perhaps in a year's time, she will make a statement or publish a written answer on those moneys, so that we know what revenue and windfall gains are available for use elsewhere. In the previous debate, my hon. Friend the Member for Cheltenham (Mr. Jones) suggested the possibility of using such revenue to reduce the price of a pint of beer. As chairman of the all-parliamentary group on beer, I would not expect him to say anything else. Such revenue could be spent in many other ways and I am sure that the Paymaster General has ideas, as do I and other hon. Members. Before the revenue can be spent, we need to know how much it is and I hope that she will report on that in due course.<br><br>
I support the Paymaster General's comments on the way in which complaints prior to the abolition of duty-free sales appear to have been unfounded. The price of shares in the companies which said that they would be affected have not fallen. The effect of abolition may have been discounted years ago, but most of the companies concerned are seeing an increase in their profits and their share prices with no major disruption from the abolition. As the Paymaster General said, BAA and other
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
companies are investing massively in shopping malls and other retail facilities. They seem to believe that their trade with the travelling public will increase substantially in the next few years.<br><br>
There has been undue alarm and that is a lesson to all of us in politics. When a powerful group spends a lot of money trying to convince us of something and persuades the public to send us lots of postcards, we should stand back and make objective decisions with the benefit of information and not because huge amounts of money are being used to try to persuade us to take another course. The abolition is taking place with a degree of all-party support, albeit with a few attempts at political point-scoring, and we have withstood the pressure, which is an achievement. I hope that other big business groups who may try to lobby us similarly in future will realise that politicians stand for the wider public interest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not dissent from the hon. Gentleman's general comments on the need to consider such matters objectively. I hope that he will not hark on political point-scoring, because I do not believe it is point-scoring to set out the history of the matter. It is often said that nations that do not know their own history are condemned to repeat their mistakes. The important point is not whether we were right—I think that we were not—but that no one was right, or everyone was right. We were all right or all wrong, because we all thought the same.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am rather confused by that intervention. I am not sure whether it was point-scoring or clarification. The record will show what the hon. Gentleman said.<br><br>
I do not want to detain the Committee any longer. The abolition of duty-free sales will prove to be beneficial. It will remove a subsidy that tended to go to the better off. Before coming to the House, I worked as a management consultant and spent most of my time travelling, when I collected air miles, a gold card from British Airways and so on. I was able to buy subsided whisky twice a week but, I hasten to add, not for my personal consumption.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I may assist the hon. Gentleman, I hope that it was for his personal consumption.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I was not explicit. That was not my personal consumption per week. I have a large stockpile.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot resist drawing to the hon. Gentleman's attention that the Paymaster General previously sponsored the idea that if he had given any of those bottles of whisky to his grandmother, he should have been thrown in jail.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall check the record, but I cannot believe that the Paymaster General would have said that. If she were to meet my grandmother, she would not wish to put her in jail. I still have not managed to persuade my grandmother to have a glass of wine at Christmas, so I do not imagine that she is about to start consuming whisky.<br><br>
The serious point I was making was that, as a management consultant, I was paid a generous salary, yet my purchases of alcohol were subsidised by the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0471">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
taxpayer, even though constituents who are on low incomes and do not travel abroad have to pay much higher prices. When one considers the issue in that way, one sees that the abolition of duty free will increase fairness in society because it will remove a subsidy, of which the better off were taking most advantage. Therefore, I believe that the abolition of duty free is a progressive step, as well as being beneficial to the economy in the long run.<br><br>
We still have to return to the other implications of the single market, especially regarding smuggling and differentials in duty rates. The abolition of duty free might have no impact at all on that because it is a totally separate issue, but there is concern. We discussed that issue in debates on the Finance Bill, and we shall have to return to it in subsequent Finance Bills because the Government must focus on that. Although it is a separate issue, the abolition of duty free clarifies the issue by making it more transparent. When we see people taking vans to Calais and bringing back huge amounts of whisky, beer and cigarettes, apparently for their personal use, we must consider the implications for the Revenue and or people's health.</span></p>
<p>10.56 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I have ever sat in a Committee dealing with Statutory Instruments in which I have heard so many confessions. The idea of the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) stockpiling whisky fills me with dread. I entirely accept his protestations that it is all for his personal consumption, even if it is over a long period.<br><br>
I want to deal with the hon. Gentleman's final point about smuggling. He was right to say that it is not connected with today' s debate, but fraud and systematic criminal activity is a serious issue and a much wider problem than the question of duty rates or VAT. The hon. Gentleman will know that there is still a substantial problem with smuggling in countries with lower duty rates, such as Belgium, which has particular problems with hand-rolling tobacco, and Italy. So the problem is much bigger and more complex, but I know that the House will continue to attend to it, as the Government already have in many of their actions since the election. Smuggling is a serious threat to our communities and denies revenue to our public services.<br><br>
On Tuesday, the hon. Member for West Dorset thought that he detected a lacuna in the legislation, but he was wrong. We should put his attempt today to rewrite history on record as a Letwinner: a tendency to make bizarre confessions. I am looking forward to the many debates that the hon. Gentleman and I will have as he continues to develop the theme of why the millennium bug hit the Conservative party in May 1997, wiping out all previous knowledge and understanding—the Conservatives are already at year zero.<br><br>
The hon. Member for West Dorset also referred to Casablanca and Gibraltar. It is fair to say that his speech was all over the place, both geographically and intellectually. He knows that the abolition of duty free relates to member states of the European Union. He will
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
be pleased to hear that the EU does not rule the world and cannot dictate rates elsewhere. He made the farcical assertion that flights to Dublin would go via Casablanca, which would be uneconomical, so that passengers could have access to duty-free goods, which the press have made clear over the past week or so are not the great bargain that they are made out to be. Passengers would have to go to Casablanca, get off the plane, go into the airport and then rejoin the plane before take-off. I am no expert on aviation, but the diverted planes would have to pay landing and facility fees to airports, and they would use much more fuel. It is odd to argue that airlines would do that to get their customers a bargain that does not really exist. They could probably buy the same goods cheaper elsewhere in the EU.<br><br>
The hon. Member for West Dorset asked about VAT and the sixth directive.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has the Paymaster General had time to reflect on the Basel problem? Will she investigate whether that is a reality, as one of my hon. Friends suggested in the previous Committee?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My answer is the same. What am I supposed to do about duty-free goods outside the EU?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Jones <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cheltenham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We discussed the issue of Gibraltar on Tuesday. I am still not clear whether duty-free facilities in Gibraltar will continue to exist.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Gibraltar is a member of the EU for single market purposes. It is represented by the United Kingdom, so Gibraltar is a member of the EU, unlike Morocco, which is not.<br><br>
The hon. Member for West Dorset asked why it was necessary to remove the zero rate on duty free from legislation. He explained that European legislation appears to relate to excise duty and not VAT. The zero rate for duty free is specified in the Finance Act 1994. We decided to remove the ambiguity because leaving it in place would have made nonsense of the legislation, which we are tidying up. That answers his convoluted question. We could have left the reference in place, but it was straightforward and sensible to remove it.<br><br>
As for the hon. Gentleman's shock at discovering the existence of the sixth directive and what it does, he should know that it derives from treaty obligations that the UK signed when it entered the EU. I am not point scoring when I remind him that that happened in 1973 under a Conservative Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Paymaster General give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I may, I will finish my answer on the sixth directive. If further matters are raised, I shall deal with them subsequently.<br><br>
The sixth directive provides a broad framework for the application of the tax across the EU. It allows some latitude over the use of reduced rates and of zero rates, and the UK takes appropriate action in that context. The hon. Member for West Dorset knows that any further convergence of or change in VAT regulations requires unanimity, and the Government are not convinced that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0472">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
such changes are currently necessary. Decisions on matters of taxation generally require unanimity, and the Chancellor continues to make it clear that we intend to support that approach in this context.<br><br>
I am reliably informed that I need to set the record straight in relation to Gibraltar. The information that I gave earlier to the hon. Member for Cheltenham is not quite right. It is true that Gibraltar is in the EU and that the UK represents it, but it is outside EU customs and fiscal territories. Flights to Gibraltar can, therefore, sell duty free. Gibraltar has a special relationship with the EU. I apologise to the hon. Gentleman for misleading him. It resulted from a genuine error on my part. In relation to all other tax issues, the UK represents Gibraltar, and I am the Minister with the relevant responsibilities.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Sydney Chapman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am interested by the Paymaster General's comments on the status of Gibraltar in relation to duty-free goods. Do the channel islands have a similar status?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. The channel islands are definitely not part of the EU. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman appreciates that Gibraltar's special relationship with the EU must be dealt with carefully. I am sorry if I misled the Committee on that matter.</span></p>
