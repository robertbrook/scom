Draft Apportionment of Money in the National Lottery Distribution Fund Order 1999</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (Mr. Chris Smith)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Apportionment of Money in the National Lottery Distribution Fund Order 1999.</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the order is to adjust temporarily the shares of national lottery income to good causes so as to provide the New Opportunities Fund with the funding that we promised it to deliver three new initiatives.<br><br>
It may help Committee members if I describe some of the background. The Government announced their intention in the White Paper that we published in the summer 1997 to establish a New Opportunities Fund, and the National Lottery Act 1998 made that a reality. NOF, as it is generally known, will fund initiatives in health, education and the environment. There is no question of the lottery taking over core funding responsibilities in those areas. That expenditure will be additional to core Government support. I was pleased to be present at NOF's official launch last Friday, when it invited applications for its first initiative—healthy living centres.<br><br>
Hon. Members will recall that we were able to create NOF without disadvantaging the existing good causes. They had originally been told to plan on the basis that they would get 20 per cent. of the £9 billion, which it was anticipated would be raised over the course of the operator's licence, which will end in September 2001. That amounted to £1.8 billion each. In the event, it became clear that the National Lottery was likely to raise an additional £1 billion, taking income for the good causes to £10 billion, rather than £9 billion. That additional £1 billion made the initial NOF programmes possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Gray <span class='memberconstituency'>(North Wiltshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the right hon. Gentleman agree with my arithmetic? Twenty per cent. of £9 billion is £1.8 billion, and 16.6 per cent. of £10 billion is £1.66 billion. If my arithmetic is correct, the good causes will receive £1 million less than they would have done beforehand.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is incorrect. The 16⅔ per cent. cam into operation only from the date of the passage of the National Lottery Act 1998. Until then, 20 per cent. had been coming in, so the overall amount that the good causes anticipate receiving is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
£1.8 billion. In fact, the proposals that we are considering today will ensure that the sum is £1.85 billion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richard Spring <span class='memberconstituency'>(West Suffolk)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am puzzled by the Secretary of State's remarks. He will recall that about seven months before Royal Assent, money was removed from the existing good causes and, in a precedent unique in the history of the House of Commons, was put in a shadow account for the purposes of NOF. I remind the right hon. Gentleman that that occurred.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amounts and the percentages that were put aside were those spelled out in the Act.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nick Hawkins <span class='memberconstituency'>(Surrey Heath)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may well be that the amounts that were put aside were those that were subsequently ratified in an Act of Parliament. However, to pursue the point that was made by my hon. Friend the Member for West Suffolk (Mr. Spring), can the Secretary of State point to a single Act that has been passed at any time during the whole history of Parliament when money was extracted before there was parliamentary approval so to do? The Government's action was unprecedented and wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is incorrect. Money was not extracted before the Act was passed; it was extracted when the Act was passed. The date on which the Act put the percentage into operation was that which had been announced. The money did not leave any other account until the Act was on the statute book. The matter was extensively debated at the time, and the scare stories that the Opposition circulated were comprehensively dismissed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We know from the Government's own statement that the money was put into what was called a shadow fund. How can the Secretary of State therefore say that he had parliamentary authority so to do? He did not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There was no shadow fund. There was an accounting procedure—[<i>Interruption.</i>] I advise hon. Members to wait a moment. An accounting procedure was in place that earmarked funds for the overall national lottery distribution fund for the purposes of NOF. No money was put into any account other than the overall national lottery distribution fund. The money was earmarked prior to the passage of the legislation. If the Bill had not been enacted, no money would have been given to NOF. As was made clear at the time, funds were given to NOF only because the legislation was passed, and they were given at the moment that it was passed. We told Parliament explicitly what was happening and what we were doing. At that stage, some hon. Members attempted to raise objections, but Parliament was perfectly happy with the procedure.<br><br>
The estimate—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Anthony Steen <span class='memberconstituency'>(Totnes)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way, but I do want to make progress.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0023">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State is making a lot of progress, and I want to help him to make further progress.<br><br>
As I understand it, I am the only person here who participated in the Standing Committee that considered the original lottery legislation. I do not know whether that gives me extra points, and entitles me to put more questions to the Secretary of State than other Committee members.<br><br>
There is something that I would like to understand, which I am sure the right hon. Gentleman can explain to a simple hon. Member in simple terms. During all the Second Reading and Standing Committee debates on the original lottery legislation, the concern of the Labour party, which was then in opposition, was additionality. I have relevant extracts from <i>Hansard</i> that give account of our proceedings on Second Reading, in Standing Committee and on Report. I shall not trouble the Committee with names at this stage, but many hon. Members complained that the Bill was defective, in that it could permit additionality and money could be siphoned off for other causes in due course.<br><br>
The amount of money—whether big or small—was irrelevant to the argument. The then Secretary of State made it clear that the Government of the day would not take away any money from the lottery: that money was set aside exclusively for the good causes. Additionality was anathema to that Government, and guarantees were given to the then Opposition that additionality would never be permitted. Does the Secretary of State agree that the order will siphon off money for things that the Treasury could otherwise fund?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind the Committee that interventions should be short. They should not be speeches, in which the hon. Gentleman can indulge when he is called.<br><br>
The Committee should also note that this is a subsequent order to legislation already passed by the House. The motion before the Committee is a narrow one, which confines discussion—if it is to be in order—to the order itself. Discussion should not include past history. So far, I have been very tolerant in allowing a full exchange of views, but I will fail to be so tolerant in future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Wells, your tolerance has indeed been extremely generous because Opposition Members have attempted to rehash, in an uninteresting way, the arguments that they developed during the Bill's passage last year.<br><br>
Let me return to the order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Wells. I asked a question that you rightly said was too long. However, the Secretary of State is avoiding answering it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order for the Chair. It is a matter for the Secretary of State. I am not responsible for his remarks.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The question will be answered fully in a moment because I anticipated that that old chestnut might arise.<br><br>
The estimate of income that will go to good causes is at least £10.6 billion over the lifetime of the licence. That is £600 million more than our previous estimate. I announced in September last year that that additional money would be split between NOF, which would get an additional £400 million, and arts, sport, heritage and charities, which would get an additional £50 million each. Rather than receiving £1.8 billion, the arts, sports, heritage and charities can each expect £1.85 billion over the lifetime of the licence. The Millennium Commission, about which I will say more later, is not affected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Fabricant <span class='memberconstituency'>(Lichfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Secretary of State claiming, as justification for the order, that various good causes, excluding NOF, have not taken into account Camelot's success in raising extra money and therefore have not made provision for projects which they have now had to cancel because of this looting of money?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The arts, sport, heritage and charities distributors were told by the previous Government at the outset of the lottery process that they would receive £1.8 billion during the lifetime of the licence. They will, in fact, receive more than that under these provisions. I remind the hon. Member for Lichfield (Mr. Fabricant) that the Labour party clearly told distributors during the 1997 election campaign that we intended to make provision for £1 billion to be taken from the good cause pot for the creation of a new fund for health, education and environment purposes. That is what we told everyone during the election campaign, and that is precisely what we put into effect in the Bill last year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fabricant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Secretary of State does not want to mislead the Committee, but was it not the case that because the previous Government could not predict whether Camelot's projections of income were realistic or pessimistic—as they turned out to be—they set the minimum at £1.8 billion? Will he take this opportunity to praise Camelot for running such a successful lottery company?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, no guarantee was given by the previous Government because no Government can give an absolute guarantee of income. An expectation of income—not a minimum—was given to distributors, and the prediction of how much was likely to be received was set by the previous Government at £1.8 billion in each case. Our expectation is that, with today's provisions, that figure will be £1.85 billion. That is our best and most prudent expectation at this stage.<br><br>
As for the hon. Gentleman's point about Camelot, I entirely accept the fact that Camelot has been running an efficient national lottery. I have said that several times and I am happy to say it again today.<br><br>
The additional £600 million, as I am sure the Committee needs no reminding, can be spent only once. In deciding how best to allocate it, I kept in mind the pressures on the good causes, but I balanced that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0024">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
against the opportunity to use it for pressing priorities in health, education and the environment. The proposed split strikes the right balance by giving arts, sport, heritage and charities £50 million more than was originally expected in each case. It also allows NOF to launch significant new initiatives. It might be useful to remind hon. Members of what NOF already plans to do, and of the additional activities that will be made possible by the extra £600 million.<br><br>
The first three initiatives were announced in September. The first aims to support out-of-school activities in half of all secondary schools and a quarter of all primary schools, and out-of-school child care for up to a million children, which will help pupils achieve more and assist working parents with child care provision. The second aims to train teachers and librarians to use information technology to help people of all ages to learn. The third aims to create a core network of healthy living centres, which will serve 20 per cent. of the population and help people to become and stay healthy. Judging by the carping of Opposition Members, I can only assume that they would support none of those initiatives.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Secretary of State accept that while all those projects are worthy in themselves, they represent the betrayal of what he said in the House of Commons, as quoted back to him by the Central Council of Physical Recreation. After the general election he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"There is no question of our replacing mainstream Exchequer funding"—</p></blockquote>
which should pay for such worthy projects—
<br><blockquote><p>"with proceeds from the lottery."—</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p>[<i>Official Report,</i> 19 May 1997; Vol. 294, c. 360.]</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When did the previous Government put any Exchequer money into such projects? The hon. Gentleman is completely silent. By his silence he admits that the Exchequer has not funded such projects. Perhaps he will tell us that his Government should have done so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to remain silent. I want the Secretary of State to answer my question. How does he explain his betrayal of his own post-election words?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but I have answered the hon. Gentleman's question. None of the initiatives—out-of-school-hours activities, child care on a national scale, the healthy living centres, or IT training for teachers and librarians—were funded by the previous Government from the Exchequer. They are all additional to the normal Exchequer expenditure on health, education and the environment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn <span class='memberconstituency'>(Guildford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State make it clear that he is saying that the Government would not spend a penny on such projects were it not for the money from the lottery?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are saying that the lottery offers a good opportunity, because it produces additional funds to fund such excellent and worthy projects. Even Opposition Members have admitted that they are worthy of Government support. I remind the hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) that during the consultation on the White Paper, in the summer of 1997, when we asked people up and down the country for their view of our proposals—which had already been supported at the general election—90 per cent. of responses were in support.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Paice <span class='memberconstituency'>(South-East Cambridgeshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: If making these issues the subject of public expenditure is a Government priority, then such expenditure should come out of normal public expenditure—that is, taxation. It is nonsense for the Secretary of State to suggest that we have changed our minds. We spent money on many of the items mentioned in our debate. When I was a Minister, I was responsible for spending quite a lot of taxpayers' money on lifelong learning, which he has identified as a key area.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When did the previous Government ever spend a single penny on creating healthy living centres or on creating out-of-school-hours clubs for kids? Perhaps the hon. Gentleman can give us chapter and verse on when the Government—as opposed to the health centres, general practitioners and local authorities that have done innovative work—[<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is my experience that Committees get out of order very quickly when there is a massive number of interventions from a sedentary position. I will try to give every opportunity to Committee members to intervene, and the Secretary of State is being very accommodating. I request Committee members to keep in order and not to intervene from a sedentary position. I understand that this is a matter of great emotion and importance and that they will therefore have to exercise considerable self-control. However, debate must be conducted according to the rules of the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, for one, will certainly be bound by your guidance. I hope that that applies to other Committee members, and to those hon. Members who are not members of this Committee, but to whom I have afforded generous opportunities of intervention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fabricant</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Wells. As my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice) has pointed out from his own ministerial experience, the Secretary of State has unwittingly misled the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is a matter for debate, not a point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members are hung up about supposed breaches of the additionality principles, so it might be helpful if I restate—as I have done on many occasions on the Floor of the House—the very simple and basic additionality principle. Lottery money should not be used to replace Exchequer expenditure;
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0025">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
it should be used to add to what the Exchequer does. That principle was clearly expressed by the former Prime Minister, the right hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major) in a speech to an English Heritage conference in September 1994, when he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We will make no case-by-case reductions on conventional public spending programmes to take account of awards from the Lottery. The money raised by the Lottery will not replace pubic expenditure".</p></blockquote>
The former Prime Minister did not follow his own words, and reduced case-by-case spending, especially on the arts. In July 1996, however, he was backed by the then Secretary of State for National Heritage, the right hon. Member for South-West Surrey (Mrs. Bottomley), who said in a reply to the Heritage Select Committee:
<br><blockquote><p>"Lottery funds are not intended to substitute for funds which would otherwise have been provided by conventional public expenditure."</p></blockquote>
Clearly, neither of those definitions of the additionality principle will be breached by the measures that we are introducing today. Opposition Members might find further clarification in a speech that Baroness Trumpington delivered in the House of Lords in November 1996. She said:
<br><blockquote><p>"In consequence, when the public expenditure programme is increased or decreased, that, in itself does not prevent, for example, the use of Lottery funds to secure projects or programmes beyond the scope of foreseeable affordability,"</p></blockquote>
—this next point is crucial—
<br><blockquote><p>"but similar to those hitherto financed by public expenditure or adding lottery funds to the level of affordable public expenditure in any particular area."—[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 4 November 1996; Vol. 575, c. 568.]</p></blockquote>
I think that the noble Lady was sailing over the line on the definition of additionality. But just because, rightly, the Exchequer spends money on the arts, that does not mean that national lottery money should not also be used for that purpose. Exactly the same principle applies to sport, on which the Exchequer rightly spends money. The national lottery allocates additional money, which is also spent on sport. In the same way, the Exchequer spends money on mainstream services in health, education and the environment. It is absolutely right to do so; I remind Opposition Members that we have committed substantial increases of funding from the Exchequer over the next three years in all those areas of public policy. That does not mean that the possibility of using lottery money to add value to what is being done by the Exchequer should be ignored. The additionality principle is not about replacing but about adding. That is what the order does.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gray</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am puzzled by the thrust of the right hon. Gentleman's argument. On one hand, he seems to be saying that the causes that will receive funds are so important that it is worth knocking the Conservative Government for not having funded them, and that they are absolutely crucial, central causes without which the nation would come to a full stop. On the other, he is saying "Oh no, it's additional because the Government would not have funded those causes themselves." For example, I understand that cancer care may be funded from the lottery. Is the Minister
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
saying that the Government will not fund cancer care, or is it essential, in which case the additionality principle has been breached?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, of course not. As the hon. Gentleman well knows, we are devoting£21 billion extra in the next three years to support the national health service, including support for cancer services and equipment throughout the country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ted Rowlands <span class='memberconstituency'>(Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the three priorities that my right hon. Friend identified for NOF as exactly those which a constituency such as mine would need. Will the Minister tell us the criteria for the allocation of that fund? Will communities have to satisfy a deprivation criterion? In other words, will the allocation be to those communities that need it most?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. The NOF board will take decisions about how the funds should be allocated. The board will act according to the framework of directions, including the direction that particular attention should be paid to the needs of areas of social deprivation. In considering applications for the healthy living centres initiative, it wants especially to target areas of social deprivation in which there are also health needs. Of course, such needs tend to be more prevalent in areas of social deprivation than elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been helped by the Minister's explanation of additionality. I am grateful to him for explaining exactly what he has in mind. The conclusion must be that anything that the Minister says is not additionality is not additionality, and everything that he says is mainstream Exchequer spending is mainstream Exchequer spending. The argument cannot go further: whatever he chooses to say applies. Is that right? Can the Minister distinguish between what is mainstream and what is additionality?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has not been listening. The definition is clear: lottery expenditure will not replace Exchequer spending. If I were to tell the House that the Government would be cutting money for the arts, sports, health or education and using lottery money to fill the gap, his argument might be correct because lottery money would be replacing Exchequer expenditure. However, none of that is happening. The Government are increasing Exchequer spending in all those sectors. By establishing NOF, the three first initiatives and further initiatives that I hope will be undertaken, we are putting in place new ideas and innovative proposals that would not otherwise have happened.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State has just said that if the Government were cutting back on sport, for example, he could be criticised. May I put this point to him? During his stewardship of his office, the Government undoubtedly have damaged sport because he allowed his colleagues in the Department for Education and Employment to take sport out of the national curriculum. Sport has been cut back, which undermines his argument.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0026">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
Furthermore, the Secretary of State tried to suggest that none of this happened under the previous Government. Yet my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire has already pointed out that life-long learning and kids' clubs networks were happening under the previous Government. Once again, the Secretary of State is raiding the lottery for what was taxpayer-funded expenditure under the previous Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. On the second point, the hon. Gentleman is wrong because we are not damaging any measures that are already in place, but establishing additional measures up and down the length of the country. On his first point, sport and physical education have not been removed from the national curriculum: those subjects have to be taught. The Secretary of State for Education and Employment made that very clear, while giving greater flexibility to primary school teachers over the planning of what should be included in the school week. He has not removed them from the curriculum: they still have to be included and taught.<br><br>
To return to the order, the additional £600 million will allow NOF to develop three further initiatives. We published our proposals last November in a consultation document, "New Links for the Lottery". The three initiatives are, first, green spaces and sustainable communities. This programme will help urban and rural communities across the UK to understand, improve and care for their natural and living environment. The main focus will be on the creation, improvement or acquisition of green spaces, particularly for children's play or because of their environmental or scenic importance. Funding would also be available to encourage sustainable communities, perhaps by making walking and cycling to school safer or using sustainable technologies.<br><br>
The second is cancer prevention, detection, treatment and care. This new programme will build on local fund-raising to address local needs by providing equipment, improving access to screening and treatment, and helping individuals and families to cope with the impact of cancer on their lives. The third is community access to lifelong learning, which will provide a step-change in access to lifelong learning. In particular it will provide IT learning centres for the university for industry; link up locally the Government's IT initiatives including the national grid for learning and ensure that local public libraries can become the heart of an IT network for the development of lifelong learning, bringing adults back into the informal education system.<br><br>
We also proposed an expansion to the after schools initiative to fund 250,000 new summer school places. We have received well over three hundred responses to our consultation, and I am currently considering them. The vast majority welcomed our ideas. I hope very soon to bring to the House an order to establish the new initiatives.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spring</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We will be waiting.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I note that the hon. Gentleman says that the Opposition will be waiting. That suggests that the Consevatives will oppose the new initiatives. I look forward to telling communities up and down the country that they cannot have green spaces, support for voluntary efforts at fund-raising for cancer or enhanced access to lifelong learning. In the eyes of the Conservatives, those projects will be opposed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Caroline Spelman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Meriden)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I register with the Secretary of State a practical problem in what he has just read to us? My constituency has fared badly under the national lottery: we are 637th in the ranking of receipts. The only application for a lifelong learning centre from a school in my constituency was rejected by the local authoirty. Is the Secretary of State more confident that, as a result of the lottery funding, bids to establish lifelong learning centres will be more favourably received by our Labour-Liberal council?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know the circumstances to which the hon. Lady refers. I shall be happy to look further into the matter if she supplies me with details. If this new initiative is accepted by the House, it will ensure that lifelong learning provision, based on schools, community halls or public libraries, will be greatly enhanced.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fraser</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I served on the Committee that considered the National Lottery Bill when the point was made about consultation of the Bill. The then Minister told us that 400 organisations had responded and only 94 members of the public had done so. The Secretary of State now tells us that 300 people have responded to consultation, 35,000 leaflets having been sent out. Does the Secretary of State believe that that is representative and a fair sampling of people's opinion about how the money should be used?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Certainly a broad spread of organisations and people have responded to us. I shall publish the full details in due course, when the hon. Gentleman will be able to examine them in depth. However, the basic principle that funds raised from the national lottery could be used for projects related to health, education and the environment was put clearly to the electorate during the general election and received overwhelming support. We have since heard nothing from the public in correspondence, responses to consultation or tests of opinion around the country to indicate anything other than that those who play the lottery and the general public are happy to see lottery money devoted to those causes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gray</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For the last time, will the Secretary of State give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Provided that it is the last time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gray</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Secretary of State. He has been extremely generous in giving way to members of the Committee.<br><br>
The Secretary of State has made the point several times about the way in which he consulted up and down the nation, which was apparently happy that its money should be spent in this way. Does he agree that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0027">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
if he says straightforwardly to the nation, "Would you like large quantities of lottery money to be used to improve the national health service and education?", both of which are so badly underfunded by his Government, the people will of course say, "Yes, please spend that money". The fact that people have apparently said that they are in favour of it does not necessarily mean that it is right.<br><br>
On that point also, will the Secretary of State tell the Committee how many people he consulted on that question and how the poll was conducted? Was it done by MORI or by a Government Department?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman accuses us of underfunding health and education. I should have thought that an additional £40 billion over the next three years, over and above the plans for health and education put in place by his Government, was hardly underfunding the system. It is an attempt to put right some of the damage that he and his Government did to our health and education services during their time in office.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fraser</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State give way on that point?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I must make progress. I have already been speaking for 40 minutes and I wish to allow other members of the Committee to contribute to this time-limited debate.<br><br>
To give effect to these plans, I must change the percentage shares of the affected good causes. If I did not do so, the current percentage split would mean that only £200 million of the additional £600 million would flow through to NOF rather than the £400 million as intended. The purpose of the order, therefore, is to transfer a further £200 million to NOF.<br><br>
My officials and I have been in discussion with the distribution bodies about how they would prefer that to be done. They decided that they would prefer a quick reduction as early as possible, followed by a return to their current percentage shares, which is what the order will do. It will reduce the percentage income share to arts, sports, heritage and charities from 16⅔ per cent. to 5 per cent. for 13 weeks from 15 February until the week commencing 10 May—for 13 weeks only.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ronnie Fearn <span class='memberconstituency'>(Southport)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a 13-week period. Will that happen again, because that is what we are worried about?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I shall refer to that in a moment. At the end of the period of reduction, the distribution bodies' share of lottery income will revert to 16⅔ per cent. and, during the same period, NOF's share will increase to 60 per cent. before reverting to 13⅓ per cent.<br><br>
I appreciate that the changes could make it more difficult for the distributing bodies to plan ahead and I am grateful to them for their constructive approach to the matter. I am, therefore, pleased to announce to the House for the first time—this refers to the point raised by the hon. Member for Southport (Mr. Fearn)—that we shall not change again the percentage
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
shares to arts, sport, heritage and charities for the remainder of the licence period. That is in addition to the undertaking already given to those good causes that they are each guaranteed 16⅔ per cent. of lottery proceeds after expiry of the current licence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spring</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Two years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In reply to the hon. Member for West Suffolk, each of those four distributors, from 10 May until beyond the existing licence period, is guaranteed 16⅔ per cent. There will be no further raid on that money—[<i>Interruption.</i>]<br><br>
The order does not affect directly the Millennium Commission, but it may be helpful if I set out for hon. Members how I anticipate development of its future funding scheme. As I have previously announced, the Millennium Commission is assured of £2.017 billion over its lifetime. At present, it receives 20 per cent. of the money that goes to the good causes. It was originally planned, however, that at the end of September 1999, the percentage shares for the Millennium Commission and NOF would switch so that the Millennium Commission would receive 13⅓ per cent. rather than 20 per cent. as at present, and NOF would receive 20 per cent. rather than 13⅓ per cent. as at present. I have now decided that the Millennium Commission's share of lottery income should remain unchanged at 20 per cent, until it reaches its target of £2.017 billion, when all of its 20 per cent. will go to NOF.<br><br>
Where does that leave the good causes? Assuming that income to the good causes over the lifetime of the licence is £10.6 billion, arts, sport, heritage and charities will each receive at least £1.85 billion, which is £50 million more than originally anticipated; the Millennium Commission will receive just over £2 billion; the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts has already been given its £200 million endowment; and NOF will receive £1 billion. I stress that those are my best estimates. Accurately predicting future lottery income is almost as difficult as predicting the numbers of the winning balls. That is why our plans have been made on the basis of cautious forecasts. If, as we all hope, more money is raised, all the good causes will share in it.<br><br>
I am clear that the continued success of the national lottery is very good news for all good causes. It is changing the face of the United Kingdom for the better and bringing benefits, direct and indirect, to all of us.<br><br>
To conclude, the order is essentially a technical measure that will give effect to the policies that we announced in September 1998. I have gone beyond that announcement, however, by giving the distributing bodies an undertaking that there will be no further change to their percentage shares for the rest of this licence and beyond. That is in addition to the undertaking that has already been given that each good cause is guaranteed 16⅔ per cent. of lottery proceeds after the current licence expires. That guarantee was never given to them by the previous Government.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0028">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
I am sure that the good causes welcome the greater certainty that our proposals will give them, and I commend the order to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I thank Committee members for their self-control in limiting the number of sedentary interventions. My reason for calling the Committee to order was to try to ensure that all Committee members who wanted to could make a contribution—and, judging by the number of interventions, many Committee members want to do so. We now have three quarters of an hour left to do just that—we must conclude by 6 pm. If Committee members keep their contributions short and sharp, all those who wish to speak will be able to do so.</span></p>
<p>5.16 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spring</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Wells. I thank the Secretary of State for explaining the order and for providing his rationale to support it. Having doubled the number of Ministers and special advisers in his Department, the right hon. Gentleman is no doubt under less time pressure. We are flattered by his surprise presence but we are not, regrettably, enlightened by his words—except, tellingly, by one word, "raid", which sums up the entire position.<br><br>
It is unclear what role the Secretary of State will occupy when the history of this Government and of this Parliament is written. His role in those pages will certainly not involve his interest in sport or his literary writings on this country's culture, but he will undoubtedly be remembered for the way in which he set about destroying the integrity of Britain's great success story, the national lottery.<br><br>
The order is yet another stage in an unprincipled attack on the lottery, which is being done for the crudest party political reasons. The order's proposed changes to the ratios relating to the good causes brings that point sharply into focus. Education, healthcare and the environment are of course fundamental and core Government spending responsibilities—they are not comparable to the arts or to our heritage in their significance and quantifiable importance.<br><br>
At the next election I fear that Labour parliamentary candidates will want to claim credit for healthy living centres that are built in their constituencies and for after-school classes, and for providing them without having spent taxpayers' money. That is at the heart of the Government's blatant political calculation. On Second Reading of the National Lottery etc. Bill in 1993, one Back Bencher in particular asked an especially pertinent question:
<br><blockquote><p>"What assurances can the Secretary of State give the House that the money from a national lottery … will not be used to replace central Government funding for a number of areas that he has designated?"—[<i>Official Report,</i> 25 January 1993; Vol. 217, c. 715.]</p></blockquote>
The Member who asked that question is the present Minister for Sport, the hon. Member for West Ham (Mr. Banks). He must be reflecting ruefully on that question, because his fears are becoming increasingly realised by the order's provisions.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
We have been told that the establishment of what is euphemistically called the New Opportunities Fund was, as the Secretary of State said, a Labour party manifesto commitment, which read:
<br><blockquote><p>"Labour has already proposed a new millennium commission to commence after"—</p></blockquote>
and I stress that last word—
<br><blockquote><p>"the closure of the Millennium Exhibition, to provide direct support for a range of education, environment and public health projects, including those directed at children's play, a project currently excluded from lottery benefit."</p></blockquote>
Today's provisions further underline a significant departure from the Government's manifesto commitment. The new fund was set up to replace the Millennium Commission. By stealth, it was changed and is to come into effect before the Millennium Commission is wound up. Also by stealth, a huge increase in moneys—in absolute and relative terms—is going to NOF, both temporarily today and after 2000.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Had the hon. Gentleman done his homework, he would know that during the election campaign, we published proposals entitled "The People's Money". That was hardly by stealth—they were announced at a national press conference; widely broadcast on the media through a series of interviews; covered in the press; mentioned on doorsteps up and down the country; and wholly supported.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spring</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The rationale for producing those proposals in the middle of the election campaign was the introduction of the Wednesday draw that had been announced by Camelot. The Labour party went into the election campaign committed to a certain view, which it began to flout. The Committee stage gave us the truly fantastic sight of Labour Members voting against what they had subscribed to in the Labour party's manifesto. The manifesto is a litany of faded and broken promises that were broken directly by Labour Members in a vote in Committee.<br><br>
During the passage of the National Lottery Bill, my hon. Friends—and my noble Friends in the other place—sought assurances on the future of, and protection for, good causes after the winding-up of the Millennium Commission. Indeed, the National Lottery Charities Board sought direct assurances. It said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Board would welcome an assurance that the ratios now set for the six distributing bodies will remain as they are until the expiry of the current Lottery operator's … licence. The board is also concerned that, if more than £10 billion is raised by the lottery over the course of the current licence, then the excess should be divided equally between each of the good causes."</p></blockquote>
That has not happened—just witness what is in the order today.<br><br>
Needless to say, we sought assurances and were unable to secure them. On 29 September last year, it was announced that one third of the total good causes money would go to NOF. My hon. Friends will be aware that the Secretary of State compounded that by establishing a new parliamentary precedent, which has been alluded to, of hiving off money for this fund, by some freak accounting mechanism, well ahead of parliamentary approval. He will be remembered for that.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0029">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
With the help of the Library, we have estimated that between October 1997, when the Secretary of State's accounting mechanism started to move the money aside, and 2005, £3.7 billion will go into the Treasury's coffers as the lottery is raided—to use his words—for core Government spending purposes.<br><br>
We know that the Secretary of State and the Chancellor of the Exchequer are not close friends. Does the Secretary of State not think that he is taking the art of ingratiating himself with the Chancellor a bit too far? People involved in sports and the caring charities do not appreciate the sight of their Cabinet defender rolling over to the Chancellor like a wet spaniel, in defence of his departmental interests.<br><br>
The introduction of NOF means that, for all practical purposes, 16 per cent. of each lottery ticket is treated and spent as taxpayers' money. The order means that between 15 February and 17 May this year, tax on the lottery will climb to 29 per cent. From 2001, 21.25 per cent. of every lottery ticket sold under Labour will be used to fund mainstream Government spending programmes. This is the most regressive form of taxation imaginable. Under the people's Government, the so-called people's lottery is a form of regressive taxation that has doubled under the Secretary of State's leadership. If the Secretary of State finds it difficult to understand the arithmetic involved, I shall be happy to send him the details, as I know what a muddle he got into by doubling and almost trebling the figures when he enunciated his departmental spending totals.<br><br>
Let nobody seek to deny that the order is a flagrant abuse of what the lottery was established to do in the first place—to finance traditionally under-resourced areas of spending, but based firmly on the principle of additionality. Indeed, the Prime Minister's words are quoted in the White Paper "The People's Lottery". He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We don't believe it would be right to use Lottery money to pay for things which are the Government's responsibilities."</p></blockquote>
We agree with him, but what has happened in practice is rather like the Prime Minister's heroic aquatic activities in the Seychelles: things prove to have been very different from what was reported.<br><br>
Let us look at the principle of additionality to which the Secretary of State has alluded, as the order will provide for spending in this way. There is a clear distinction, which is obvious to any fair-minded person, between what is essential and what can be deemed to be desirable. Undoubtedly, many people rightly feel that healthy living centres and IT training for teachers and librarians are wholly desirable. However, much of their enthusiasm begins to dim if they are the beneficiaries of the original good causes and care about the fair and adequate financing of charities and sporting activities as the funding is cut.<br><br>
Indeed, the former Secretary of State, my right hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Brooke), made a similar point in the debate last year on the National Lottery Bill. He
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
quoted an article by Liz Forgan that had appeared in the <i>Evening Standard</i> on 17 December 1997, in which she asked:
<br><blockquote><p>"in what way is this spending on health, education and the environment different from the Government's normal spending on health, education and the environment? Send for a Jesuit."</p></blockquote>
My right hon. Friend, who introduced the lottery and won public support for it, went on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"Treasury theology is usually erected as a Treasury defence against spending Departments. Here we have a spending Department conniving with the Treasury in the deployment of the theology."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 7 April 1998; Vol. 310, c.204.]</p></blockquote>
Let us see what that means in practice. The White Paper "Health of the Nation" states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Healthy living centres will play an important role in the Government's public health strategy."</p></blockquote>
It sounds very central to me. Where is the additionality? If that is not core funding, how is it to be defined?<br><br>
The principle of additionality has similarly been flouted over IT training. As long ago as December 1997 we learnt that the Government provide £296.8 million to train serving teachers under the grant for education support and training programme, around 5 per cent. of which is spent directly on IT. Similarly, we know that the initiatives to provide training for serving teachers and librarians will be paid for by the digitisation of educational and learning materials in schools and libraries.<br><br>
The Government have already given the game away, despite the Secretary of State's protestations. In another place Lord McIntosh of Haringey said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Given the other pressures on the Exchequer, it is inconceivable that we would be contemplating provision for out-of-school learning and childcare, and healthy living centres".—[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 19 January 1998; Vol. 584, c.42.]</p></blockquote>
So much for the Secretary of State's cherished definition of additionality.<br><br>
We have seen and have welcomed an enormous expansion in primary health care, arising especially out of general practitioner fundholder practices. As a result of the order and the Bill that sets out the pattern for the next few years, the lottery player will become a taxpayer. Perhaps the Secretary of State could arrange one of his famed photo calls, in which he would stand holding a very large cheque made out to the Department of Health or the Department for Education and Employment. That is the reality of the situation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would just like to say what a good speech my hon. Friend is making—it is riveting. May I ask my hon. Friend—as he has done the research, and makes his case well—whether he is saying, as the spokesman for the Conservative party, that we are in favour of the projects that the Secretary of States describes, but that the lottery should not be raided to fund them?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spring</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend sums up my position with perception. I need add nothing more on that point.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0030">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
We have come full circle. The legitimate worries that Labour Members expressed six years ago are now being realised with a vengeance. Today, we shall be asked to agree to £400 million being taken away from the original good causes, which are already being hit by the cuts in their allocations from 20 per cent. to 16⅔ per cent. We shall be invited to witness a wholesale and disproportionate raid, which, implicitly, will support other Government departmental spending as the millennium stream dries up.<br><br>
The London firm of Farrer and Co. responded to the Secretary of State's comprehensive spending review. It stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"We fear that there is a danger in the boundary between Lottery funding and Grant-in-Aid becoming so blurred as to remove any tangible difference between the two."</p></blockquote>
It concluded that,
<br><blockquote><p>"the loss of any practical distinction between Lottery funding and Grant-in-Aid and the tying of the process of Lottery distribution more closely to the strategic priorities of the Department will inevitably lead to the adoption of Lottery funding as an adjunct to public spending. This may result in a consequential loss of public support for the Lottery, which until now has been a highly successful means of raising funds for cultural initiatives."</p></blockquote>
As the next Cabinet reshuffle approaches, I hope that the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretaries of State for Health and for Education and Employment will speak glowingly of the right hon. Gentleman's valiant efforts to swell their coffers. By contrast, Opposition Members take the opposite view and strongly oppose the order.</span></p>
<p>5.33 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will pursue just one of the hon. Gentleman's points, as we are short of time. I do not know a great deal about the theology of additionality, but, in simple terms, much of the arts in our communities would have collapsed completely without the lottery, because of the lack of funding from Conservative Governments for 18 years. I do not know whether the lottery money was additional, but it saved many of the arts. Governments do not give support when we have philistine Governments—as we did for most of those 18 years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spring</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman clearly cares deeply about the arts, how will those involved in the arts interpret the fact that, of the £600 million over and above that which had been expected from the lottery, only £50 million is for the arts and £400 million for NOF?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State dealt with that point extremely well. If the arts had depended on public funding under the previous Administration, they would be in a seriously damaged state. Whether or not the lottery funding is additional matters not to me—all I know about is its consequences.<br><br>
I want to ask my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State a specific question on the criteria that are to be used in the allocation of funding under NOF, which relates to a point that I pursued with him during an
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
intervention. The board associated with NOF is a quango, and I should tell him that I have a modest aversion to quangos—although I understand the reasons for its existence. It is all the more important, therefore, that the criteria, direction and priorities that are to be given to the board are made clear.<br><br>
Given that we are to invest in the three key areas of training support for serving teachers and library staff, out-of-school-hours activities and a core network of healthy living centres, how will the allocation of resources take account of the deprivation factor? How will the Government convey the social deprivation criteria, and in what way will the board interpret and analyse them? Those are extremely important points.<br><br>
We were all rather jealous of the way in which lottery money was allocated under the previous regime, and we therefore have a particular interest in the way that funds are to be allocated under the new arrangements. In the light of the importance of the social deprivation criteria, I hope that my right hon. Friend will elaborate on the criteria that the board will use in allocating resources.</span></p>
<p>5.36 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fearn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to keep my remarks brief, Mr. Wells, as you have asked us to do.<br><br>
During the debate we had many comments on the question of where the money is going and where it should go. As always, we oppose the apportionment of lottery money. A three-month slice—which will reduce the 16⅔ per cent. allocation to 5 per cent.—is indeed a big slice. Members of sporting fraternities, the arts, heritage and the charities—which we must not forget—will regret the Government taking this step.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way? <i>[Interruption.]</i> He is a friend of mine on this particular point.<br><br>
Does he agree that, but for a raid of this kind, he and I would be in total agreement? The Arts Council would otherwise have additional money with which to fund such worthy causes as the quintessentially British D'Oyly Carte Gilbert and Sullivan company which spreads joy throughout the country, and which is deprived of a penny piece by the Secretary of State's Department and the Arts Council.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fearn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Given that I am an advocate of the D'Oyly Carte continuing its great work, I wholeheartedly agree with the hon. Gentleman, as, I am sure, do other Committee members.<br><br>
When I asked the Secretary of State whether the reduction in funding for the arts, sport, heritage and the charities would happen again, he categorically assured me—twice—that it would not. I will remember those words, which are now recorded in tablets of stone.<br><br>
Areas such as health, education and the environment may benefit from NOF, but they should surely be funded through national taxation. The Secretary of State mentioned many worthy causes that will benefit from the extra money that will be taken—
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0031">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
I shall not use the word "raided", which I am sure was a slip on his part—from the fund. National taxation should be providing for those causes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gray</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fearn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I will not.<br><br>
I have had a letter from the Central Council of Physical Recreation, stating that funding for the world champion class, which is putting our sportsmen and women through college, has already been cut back. I have the letter with me. Because of the cuts and the three-month gap, it looks as though that programme will be harmed.<br><br>
Air conditioning in art galleries is another possibility. Many applications are already in the pipeline and have probably been agreed. However, as a result of other initiatives, there will be other claims. Air conditioning in art galleries helps to preserve many art treasures that have been stored away for many years. If that programme is held up for three months, it will be damaging.<br><br>
Some charities are suffering even more now because of the lottery. Some of the major charities and good causes have been helped, but many of the minor ones are still suffering. As I said, a three-month gap may put many of them out of business. That is why I feel that this is a retrograde step. It should not happen again, as the Secretary of State said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gray</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Her Majesty's opposition will be grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his implicit support on the subject. Can he tell us whether the issue has been raised at the joint committee between his party and the Government? If so, did his leader take the same view in that committee as the hon. Gentleman is taking now?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fearn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have no knowledge of that. It may well be, but, as I say, I have no knowledge of it. It looks as though we are robbing Peter to pay the Chancellor and I will finish with those words.</span></p>
<p>5.41 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Wells, for the opportunity to make a brief contribution. The Minister, as did my hon. Friend the Member for West Suffolk, used the word "raid", but I was going to start by talking about robbing the lottery for core activities. Perhaps, though, it is really confiscation of lottery money away from people who thought that they were helping good causes to fund functions that are properly the responsibility of the taxpayer.<br><br>
In my earlier intervention, I mentioned my small role in dealing with some of the issues that are now proposed to be funded out of NOF. I can tell the Minister that we had a series of plans for lifetime learning, many of which were described in the consultation document that was published in our last year of office. Had we been returned, we would have continued with those plans and paid for them out of central taxation—not by robbing the lottery.<br><br>
It is impossible to understand how the Secretary of State can expect us to believe that we are not dealing with core material. As he said himself, the Government are already spending large sums of money on those
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
items—cancer relief being the obvious example—out of taxation. It is ludicrous to suggest that cancer relief can be both core and non-core expenditure, which is the logical conclusion to be drawn from the Secretary of State's attempts to hijack the lottery.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman apply the same argument to Government spending on the arts, sport or heritage?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I would not. At the time of the National Lottery etc. Bill—my hon. Friend the Member for Totnes was wrong because I, too, served on the Committee considering it—it was made clear that funds were intended for aspects of arts and sports that would not feature as a number one priority for any Government. The argument was that the only way of ensuring support for them was through the lottery. It defies belief for the Secretary of State to suggest that cancer research is not a number one priority.<br><br>
Nowhere in the original debates did the Labour party suggest that it wanted to introduce a new good cause. As my hon. Friend the Member for West Suffolk said, Labour opposed the whole concept of raiding the lottery. The Secretary of State referred to his election commitment to secure an extra £1 billion—the difference between the initial budget of £9 billion and the reality of £10 billion—from the lottery, which may be acceptable. However, he is now proposing an extra £3.3 billion. If the Lottery continues to run at a margin of good causes profit of £10 billion, £3.33 billion would go on NOF after 2001. That is another broken promise, as a figure of £1 billion was given in the election campaign.<br><br>
That is a form of hidden public expenditure, so it is not surprising that the Treasury is very pleased. Some £3.3 billion will come out of lottery expenditure, and will not show up as public expenditure in normal Government funds. It is important that observers who follow such matters and influence our economy understand that the Government propose to use NOF to hide £3.3 billion of public expenditure under the table. We cannot be expected to agree that, from 2001, 33 per cent. of lottery money should go on such expenditure. That is not the purpose of the lottery. People who buy lottery tickets think that they are helping the extra good causes that were described when the lottery was orginally set up.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fraser</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the National Lottery Bill was debated in Committee it was interesting to listen to the then Minister and read accounts of the debates in <i>Hansard.</i> He was subsequently removed from office. It will be interesting to see how the Secretary of State fares after the current raid on the lottery.<br><br>
During Committee debates on the National Lottery etc. Bill, Labour Members spoke only to plead for the needs of their own constituencies, knowing that the Secretary of State would deliver once the Bill was enacted. That is an indictment of the current Government's actions.<br><br>
The Secretary of State said that consultation has taken place. However, as I pointed out, that consultation was not extensive and does not provide
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0032">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
him with a mandate for implementing his plans. How much consultation took place with the original distributing bodies? Has information on that been published? It was not available when the Bill was debated in the House.<br><br>
Lottery funding is not a reliable source of money for the Government on issues such as health, education and the environment—which have social, economic and political connotations. Funding for core Government responsibilities should be raised by taxes, not taken away from the original good causes that previously received little help from public funding.<br><br>
NOF puts Government responsibilities before those of the people. That is an exceedingly important point. Lottery funding should be awarded on the merits of the bid, not on the Government's authority.<br><br>
On 23 April, I said that the diversity inherent in voluntary community initiatives would be removed because they would not be considered on their merits. Future funding for cancer research, treatment and care would increasingly depend on people's confidence in the lottery and the economic climate. A reduction in tickets purchased would therefore mean that less money would be in areas in which money is needed as part of key and core Government spending.<br><br>
Public spending programmes constantly evolve, as Committee debates on the National Lottery Bill revealed. We cannot allow the Government to use their position to influence spending through the lottery. I pointed out at the time that, even with the most creative accounting, we could not rightly transfer the funds from the national lottery to pay for such evolution. NOF has been established to distribute money, but how the Government decide to use the money is the key issue. Many issues have been raised this evening to which I should like the Secretary of State to respond in full.</span></p>
<p>5.49 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Jones <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cheltenham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: What is the Secretary of State's best estimate of how much money will not be distributed to sport that otherwise would have been distributed had it not been for the order? Emergency money is needed now by athletics organisations to replace tracks that were laid during the 1980s. At least a dozen all-weather, no-maintenance tracks are now worn out, and local authorities have to find a substantial amount of money to repair them.<br><br>
In my constituency, the local authority needs to find about £185,000. It would cost less than £3 million to replace a dozen tracks, and I should be interested to hear from the Secretary of State whether the money that would have gone to sport, but which will now not be spent on sport, would have helped in that respect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spring</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can help the hon. Gentleman. The English Sports Council estimates that its budget, which hitherto has been around £250 million will drop to about £210 million, because of the raid—in the words of the Secretary of State—on sport as a result of the change.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. Having done a little mental arithmetic, I think that he is saying that one week's extra money would solve the problem for athletics. Will the Secretary of State think about that? Local authorities are putting in lottery bids to enable them to replace their tracks and I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will be forthcoming with that relatively small amount of money. He would then become a friend of athletics throughout the country.</span></p>
<p>5.52 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Marsha Singh <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point about additionality is that it is over and above what has already been budgeted for. I shall cite an example of section 11 funding, which has been used extensively in my constituency—predominantly to teach English. English teachers were present in schools with high levels of ethnic minority children, but section 11 funding allowed additional teachers to be taken on to meet that particular need. The Secretary of State said that we were spending over and above what we would have otherwise been spending.<br><br>
Conservative Members have somehow turned the lottery into a good cause. They suggest that people buy tickets because they think that they are supporting a good cause. In fact, the lottery is a gambling exercise. People buy lottery tickets to win millions of pounds they do not buy tickets … because the proceeds go to good causes. If it is a gambling piggy-bank, I would like the money to be spent on health, education and the environment. Are not they good causes, too? Conservative Members do not think so; they regard the opera as a good cause.<br><br>
We are using lottery funding to meet people's needs and aspirations. It will be used to meet the needs of the many, not the few, as it was before.</span></p>
<p>5.54 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can quickly answer some of the points that have been made.<br><br>
The first is the genuine question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands). He wanted to know how deprivation factors would be taken into account by the new opportunities fund when it decided on the allocation of funds. NOF will, of course, have to consider all applications, but it already has the power under the National Lottery Act 1998 to be proactive in stimulating applications. It will use the standard indices of deprivation, which genuinely reflect patterns of deprivation across the country, but it is also required, within the framework of directions, to ensure a fair geographical spread.<br><br>
The second is the point raised by the hon. Member for Southport. It is interesting to note that the genuine points raised in the debate came from either Labour or Liberal Democrat members of the Committee; the official Opposition engaged only in a lot of knee-jerking. The hon. Gentleman asked about the world class performance programme. I shall check the figures, but as far as I am aware no reduction is in prospect for that programme. Despite what the Central Council of Physical Recreation said in its letter
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0033">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
to hon. Members, an established programme of continued spending for the next few years, has been clearly established by the various sports councils. However, I shall check the figures.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Owen Paterson <span class='memberconstituency'>(North Shropshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, because I have only a short time left.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Cheltenham (Mr. Jones) asked how much money would not be distributed to sport that would have been distributed if the order had not been made. The best estimate that I can give him is that it is about £50 million. The hon. Gentleman also spoke about the emergency money that he said was needed to upgrade athletics tracks. In fact, the English Sports Council has substantial resources earmarked for it in the national lottery development fund which could be allocated for that precise purpose. It is not a decision for me, but there is no lack of money in the lottery fund should a decision be taken to proceed. I recommend that the hon. Gentleman lobbies the English Sports Council, because it is obviously an important issue.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Mr. Fraser) asked what consultation there had been with the existing distributing bodies. There has been detailed and close consultation with all existing distributing bodies. Indeed, the percentage change recommended in the order is what those bodies wished to see, in view of the Government's overall decision.<br><br>
The Opposition appear to have advanced two arguments. Neither of them make sense. The first is that because the Government already spend money on health and education we should not spend lottery money on them. If Conservative Members applied that argument seriously to existing good causes, we would not be spending lottery money on anything. We need to ensure—</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paterson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Wells. The Secretary of State is distorting what we said. The Prime Minister—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is not a matter for the Chair; it is a matter of argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Smith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We need to ensure that new, innovative initiatives are added to work that is already going on, which is precisely what the order does.<br><br>
Secondly, the Opposition say that these things are wholly desirable. We agree. However, it is obvious from what they say that they would either not do them at all, or that they would increase taxes in order to do them. We chose neither of those options. We are using instead the opportunity allowed us by the increased lottery income to ensure that those initiatives, which Conservative Members agree are worth while, can indeed be supported.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to members of the Committee for their self-restraint and for allowing everyone who wished to speak to do so.</span></p>
