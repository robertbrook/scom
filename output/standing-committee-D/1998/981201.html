	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Tourism, Film and Broadcasting (Janet Anderson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Broadcasting (Restrictions on the Holding of Licences) (Amendment) Order 1998.</p></blockquote>
This order will lift the restrictions in broadcasting legislation that prevent British Telecom and other public telecommunications operators from providing broadcast television through their telecommunications networks. To date, a PTO seeking to deliver such an entertainment service has had to create a subsidiary company to compete in the auction of cable franchises run by the Independent Television Commission. If it was successful—as in the case of the Milton Keynes and Westminster franchises—it had to build a new cable network separate from its existing telecommunications network. The order will enable PTOs to hold such broadcasting licences directly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will be aware that in April the Government published "Broadband Britain: a fresh look at the broadcast entertainment restrictions", which set out how we would deliver our manifesto commitment to end the entertainment restrictions on PTOs. In that policy document we made clear that PTOs, cable operators and others should have the immediate option to compete in the provision of broadcast entertainment to the 17 per cent, of United Kingdom homes that are currently outside cable franchise areas. We also announced our intention to allow PTOs and cable operators to compete in the provision of television services by wire throughout the country from 1 January 2001. That will end the previous licensing practice of awarding exclusive cable franchises to the highest cash bidder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order is the only change to broadcasting legislation that is required to implement proposals in "Broadband Britain". The Committee may find it helpful if I explain briefly the steps that have been—or will be—taken by the Independent Television Commission to deliver by administrative means the commitments in "Broadband Britain". I should add that the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, my right hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Mandelson) is currently considering, in close consultation with my Department, the Independent Television Commission and the Office of Telecommunications, how best to progress the necessary changes to telecommunications licensing arising from "Broadband Britain".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
The ITC has already implemented the Government's commitment to facilitate open competition in the provision of broadband services to those areas currently not covered by cable franchises. On 2 November, the ITC published its invitation to apply for local delivery service licences to cover the four million British homes that are currently outside cable franchise areas. Those licences—in accordance with the ITC policy that was revised to reflect "Broadband Britain"—will be non-exclusive. That will enable PTOs, cable operators and others to compete openly in the delivery of services to businesses and consumers in the currently unfranchised areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In April, the ITC announced that existing cable franchisees could apply to the Commission to replace their present exclusive licences—containing terms set out on the basis of exclusivity—with new nonexclusive licences containing revised terms. The new non-exclusive licences would, by their nature, enable others to compete in the franchise area. That would be reflected in the licence terms, which would include the level of payments to the Exchequer, along with other obligations. By such means, those holding exclusive franchises can determine whether to continue to pay the price of exclusivity until 1 January 2001 or accept open competition immediately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Licensees in 10 franchise areas have asked the Commission to re-advertise their franchises on a nonexclusive basis, and the Commission aims to grant the new licences by the end of this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the ITC intends to invite applications in mid-2000 for further licences in currently exclusive areas to be effective from 1 January 2001. That will complete the delivery of the principal broadcasting objectives of "Broadband Britain", it will end the exclusive nature of cable franchises, and it will open up competition between different cable operators, public telecommunications operators and others in the provision of broadband entertainment services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the phased introduction of the Government's approach to the licensing of cable franchises balances the need of existing cable operators to finance the remainder of their network provision, and the needs of all service providers to plan and finance their strategies for digital services with confidence. The introduction of truly open competition from 1 January 2001 will benefit the industry and the consumer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The phased implementation of the new broadcasting licensing regime following "Broadband Britain" is an example of the Government's evolutionary approach to tackling the implications of convergence. We have implemented our policies by administrative means to deliver the practical results that the industry wants and needs rather than rushing in with a stop-gap revision to the statutory regime. Assessment of changes to that statutory regime can be made in a more considered manner—it could be informed by responses to our Green Paper "Regulating Communications". That will enable any changes to be more fully thought through, and it will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0008">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
prevent regulatory uncertainty at a critical time for the broadcasting industry as it invests in the new digital technology.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order is but the first step in achieving the Government's broadcasting objectives, and it will help to lift the current entertainment restrictions on public telecommunications operators. I hope that we all agree that those measures are necessary, and I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.37 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Spring 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Suffolk)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for her explanation. My hon. Friends and I will support the order this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The full implementation of the European Court of Justice's ruling on the Broadcasting Act 1990 arises from the view that it expressed in September 1996. The order will, in practice, remove the last anomaly of the now defunct domestic satellite system regime, which was ended by last year's satellite television service regulations. I reinforce what my hon. Friend the Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale) said at the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is now no logical place for a division between the domestic and the non-domestic satellite services market. It is far more sensible and rational to have a unified satellite market. Under the previous arrangements, the all-satellite broadcasters were defined as non-domestic, although BSkyB, which is a British company, invests considerably in this country each year. We therefore support the removal of the last vestiges of that division, which is now redundant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals also start in train the removal of a further division within the broadcasting market. Opening the market for United Kingdom homes outside the current franchise area is an exciting new development in the world of television, and will enable a further 4 million homes to have access to the very latest entertainment. For example, our fellow citizens north of the border in the highlands will almost certainly be able to benefit from a major change in Britain—namely, the multi-media revolution. The expanding and ever-developing world of transmission will therefore allow millions of homes to experience quality that is far beyond that which is provided by any analogue service. Seventeen per cent, of United Kingdom homes are currently outside cable franchise areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The previous Government were fully aware of the need to free up the market, and sought to do so when they deemed it appropriate. They took the view that allowing growth through small, exclusive cable franchises was the best initiation to a broader, nonexclusive, cabled Britain. The present Government consider that now is the time to allow PTOs access to the previously uncharted waters of unfranchised Britain. They also see 2001 as the appropriate time for competition throughout Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, I welcome the freeing up of the market, but I hope that sufficient time has been allowed to enable smaller operators to compete with the larger networks of PTOs. Perhaps the Minister can touch on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
The Government's paper, entitled "Broadland Britain: a fresh look at the broadcast entertainment restrictions", which was published last April, required modifications to certain telecommunications licences. Will the Minister indicate what contact there has been between her Department and the Department of Trade and Industry about the matter?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an era of rapidly changing technology, an environment is being created that should enable computer, media and telecommunications companies to provide telephone, television and computer services. The lower costs of much new technology is spurring on the creation of that environment. I welcome the trials that are currently being undertaken in London and Hull.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The creation of a healthy, competitive cable services market is an important step in the continuing multimedia revolution. It will bring entertainment to many who would have otherwise missed out. We are therefore happy to support the Government in this matter, and in bringing about a better overall service for Britain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.43 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Maclennan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the order. However, in the light of the Minister's comments, what representations, if any, have the Government received from those small cable operators who are worried about changes that will allow PTOs such as BT to compete with them? Has an assurance been given that their position has been secured and their investment rewarded?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the hon. Member for West Suffolk (Mr. Spring), I broadly welcome the widening of competition. However, one needs to know precisely what the effect of such a widening will be. It is anticipated that PTOs will have the option to compete in the provision of broadcast entertainment to the 17 per cent, of United Kingdom homes currently outside cable franchise areas. What indications have the Government received that the widening of competition will in fact be taken up? Is it likely that the highlands will receive that benefit? Is the commercial reward to the PTOs sufficiently attractive to make that a realistic prospect in the short term? It would be helpful to know what has been said to the Government about that, and about the prospect of greater coverage in other rural areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.44 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Janet Anderson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, may I thank hon. Members for their support for the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Suffolk asked whether consideration had been given to allowing smaller networks sufficient time to establish themselves. As he knows, "Broadband Britain" was published after extensive consultation with all parts of the cable sector. As we all know, we are on the eve of a broadcasting and media revolution. I can further reassure the hon. Gentleman that my Department is in close and regular contact with our colleagues at the Department of Trade and Industry.

	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
The right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (Mr. Maclennan) asked whether the opportunity will be taken to improve the service to consumers in the highlands. At this stage, it is difficult to say. As I am sure he will appreciate, we must wait and see how the entire matter develops. However, the Government's view and priority is that the consumer, for whom the subject is important, should be provided
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
with an improved service and greater choice. We shall ensure that that happens during the course of what will undoubtedly be a broadcasting revolution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
