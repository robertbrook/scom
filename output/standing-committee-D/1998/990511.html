Education (School Organisation Committees) (England) Regulations 1999</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Theresa May <span class='memberconstituency'>(Maidenhead)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Education (School Organisation Committees) (England) Regulations 1999 (S.I. 1999, No. 700).</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the Education (School Organisation Plans) (England) Regulations 1999 (S.I. 1999, No. 701) and the Education (Transition to New Framework) (School Organisation Proposals) Regulations 1999 (S.I. 1999, No. 704).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. May</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I make several detailed points about the statutory instruments, I shall explain why Opposition Members are concerned about the introduction of the school organisation committees that the Government put in place under the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. I must say, however, that it is nice to see some old faces in Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for School Standards (Ms Estelle Morris)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Getting older!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. May</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, getting older at every stage. We are concerned about the structure of school organisation committees, which show two of the trends that are characteristic of the Government, the first being of which is an increase in bureaucracy and administrative burdens. Why have one committee considering an issue when there could be two? Why have 10 members of a committee when there could be 50 or 100 members? Examples of such bureaucracy are yet again being shown in the way in which school organisation committees are to operate. The Government are constantly introducing structures that are cumbersome, unwieldy, over-bureaucratic and impractical, and I shall explain how that policy relates specifically to the proposals that we are discussing.<br><br>
The second, perhaps more sinister and worrying, aspect of the Government's proposals is their attempt to deny the legitimacy of decisions taken by democratically elected representatives. Given what goes on inside the Labour party, we are well aware that the Government have tried to manipulate votes so that the centre of the party here in London gets its own way. Let us consider the vote for the Labour leadership in Wales. However, the electorate in Falkirk, West—</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. May I suggest that the hon. Lady sticks to the statutory instruments under discussion?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. May</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Cunningham. I had almost finished my sentence; I was saying how the Government, through their internal arrangements, try to deny the legitimacy of democratically taken decisions, which is what they are doing in the introduction of school organisation committees.<br><br>
Under current arrangements, decisions about the structure and organisation of schools in a local education authority area are taken initially by that authority's democratically elected councillors as representatives of the local electorate. They are then passed on for a final decision to be made by the Secretary of State—who, again, is democratically elected and to whom local Members of Parliament can make representations and take delegations to express the concerns of local residents. Both decision-making groups—local councillors or the Secretary of State—are democratically elected.<br><br>
Under the regulations, when the local council has decided on a school's organisation, that decision cannot then be passed directly to the Secretary of State. Inserted in the process is the new body, the school organisation committee whose membership and structure is set out in SI 700. That Committee is interposed between the local education authority and the person who decides on the school organisation structure for the area.<br><br>
The school organisation committee is not an elected representative committee, but it will now be interposed in the process. Beyond that committee, however, decisions do not go to the Secretary of State as an elected representative but to the adjudicator—a new role, referred to in SI 701. Those are our general concerns. As I said, however, we wish to make some detailed comments on the proposals.<br><br>
Yet more bureaucraacy is being put into place; more administrative burdens are being imposed on local authorities; and more people will be appointed to yet more committees. The Government may think it useful to be able to make appointments to so many local committees, but it takes decision-making power away from those elected local councillors who serve on the local education authority. That is our main concern. The Standing Committee expressed a similar concern when it considered the 1998 Act; and the same view was forcefully expressed when the Act was debated in the other place.<br><br>
SI 700 deals with the membership of the committee. It takes some time to get one's mind around the various regulations. So many sub-paragraphs, clauses and schedules have to be referred to determine the membership of the committee that I may not have fully grasped it. I therefore have several questions.<br><br>
My main questions are about the schools group. Complicated decisions have to be made about the number of people from the schools group who can be members of the school organisation committee, and about the constituencies that they are appointed to represent. I understand that there must be a mixture; there must be a member from each of the different types of school— primary, secondary, special and middle school. Overlaid
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0602">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
on that, however, is a desire to ensure that each category of school—community, voluntary and foundation—is represented. That representation will depend on the percentage of pupils in the area who are educated within the various categories of school.<br><br>
The local education authority in my area covers most of my constituency. I have no foundation schools or special schools, but I do have some secondary and primary voluntary schools. I understand that no one will be appointed from the special school and middle school sector, but that the number from primary and secondary schools in that schools group will be divided; some will come from the secondary and primary community schools and some will come from other groups. I realise, Mr. Cunningham, that I have made my first error. The only voluntary schools that are allowed in that category are non-Roman Catholic or Church of England.<br><br>
In my constituency, only one primary school and one secondary school would be represented. Will the Minister say whether, in such a scenario, it would be possible to have so few representatives from the schools group? At the other extreme, the number of types and categories of schools paints a more diverse picture. There could be 10 members from the schools group, to ensure that the 10 per cent, of secondary pupils who were being educated at a foundation secondary school could be represented separately in that schools group.<br><br>
The number of people from the schools group can therefore vary significantly, from as few as two, or perhaps three where there is a special school, to as many as 10 or so. I would like clarification from the Minister on that point. I should also like clarification on the issue of someone who is a governor of both a primary and a secondary school; if that person were appointed to the school organisation committee, would he or she represent both schools or would each school need separate representation?<br><br>
The total number of representatives on the committee is also a matter of concern. There could be as few as 37—although that is hardly a small number of people sitting around a table—or as many as 45. We all know the difficulty of arriving at decisions in a committee and of deciding the correct number of representatives, but 45 people debating the issues could make the decision-making process more cumbersome than even the Government had intended. Paradoxically, 45 people will not mean 45 votes. There will be only one vote per group; groups will therefore have to decide their single vote outside the meeting in order to bring it to the meeting. So we would have a large number of people debating the issue but a small number of votes to determine whether a committee approves a school organisation plan.<br><br>
The question of balance on the committee is also important. The Opposition have consistently supported church schools and have concerns about the long-term implications for them of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. Under the regulations, the Roman Catholic and the Church of England diocese concerned can each have up to seven representatives on the Committee, whereas in an area such as my own, the schools group, consisting of the members of governing bodies, could have as few as two or three representatives. The Minister may say that in such circumstances, the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
churches would be expected to examine carefully the number of people that they appoint to the committee and that ultimately a group would have only one vote. Why, then, allow for a maximum of seven people in each group? That maximum number also applies to the Further Education Funding Council for England, which is now to be brought into the decisions; it was not involved in them when they were taken by local education authorities. Does the Minister intend that the FEFC will always have the further education vote, if I can call it that? If the post-16 review were to change and a single body, as under published proposals for Wales, were to be responsible for considering all post-16 education, would that be represented on the committee rather than the FEFC?<br><br>
I also have a question about special schools. As the Minister knows, the issue of special educational needs has consistently been raised in the discussions on the School Standards and Framework Act because of a concern to ensure that SEN and special schools are properly represented and given a voice in such arrangements. As I understand the schedule to SI 700, if there were one or more special schools in a local education authority but they had less than five per cent, of the total pupils, would they still be assured representation on the school organisation committee? It is important that special schools are involved in such decisions.<br><br>
SI 701 deals with school organisation plans and refers to the possible submission of a draft plan to the adjudicator.<br><br>
The local eduction authority will decide a draft plan on which consultation will take place. The plan and comments on it will be considered by the new body, the school organisation committee, which will have three options. It could say, "Yes, the local authority's got it right, regardless of any comments and objections. We approve its school organisation plan." However, it could say that it does not approve the plan and wishes to produce its own proposals, which could, as I understand it, be based on proposals made by community groups, school staff or parents, or on an amalgam of comments made about the sort of draft plan that might work, The third option is that it could refuse to make a plan of its own and refer the matter to the adjudicator.<br><br>
Where there is controversy about a plan's details, an adjudicator will decide on it. Adjudicators are not elected but appointed by the Secretary of State. Under other regulations that we have not brought to debate in Committee, adjudicators will not know the local area on which they will make decisions. They cannot live in the area and must not have been involved in the local education authority for a certain amount of time.<br><br>
Currently, the local education authority—the democratically elected councillors—takes such decisions, which are referred to the Secretary of State, to whom Members of Parliament have rights to take delegations and make representations. The change will be from a process in which the democratically elected representatives of the people make decisions, to one in which decisions will go through a cumbersome organisation committee and end with an adjudicator appointed by the Secretary of State and not elected by anyone. That is at the heart of our concerns about the proposals.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0603">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
I am also concerned about the voting procedure in the regulations, which is backed up by the voting procedure in the School Standards and Framework Act. As I suggested earlier, each group does not have a number of votes according to the number of members present when determining whether a draft plan is correct, but one vote only for each group. As I understand it, what matters is the number of votes of those present and voting on the specific day on which the decision is taken. A group represented by a small number of members who are not present and have not, for various practical reasons, been able to appoint alternates would not have a vote in that decision on the school organisation plan. The fact that a meeting may be called at only seven days' notice may cause practical problems in appointing alternates.<br><br>
Why put a procedure in place that means that a group need not be represented when the final decision is taken on the school organisation plan if the Government are serious about all the different groups having a say in it? That is a matter of concern. The Minister may say that certain people have a right to take the decision over and above the right of councillors, the elected representatives of the local electorate. If so, surely a preferable scenario would involve each group having to be represented on the school organisation committee at the time at which the vote is taken.<br><br>
Those are my detailed comments and, as I said in my opening remarks, we have two main concerns about the proposals. They are cumbersome and over-bureaucratic and put in place an administratively burdensome structure for local education authorities and for decision-making on school organisation in any area. Perhaps more significantly, they take the decision-making power away from those who have been democratically elected and give it to those who have been appointed.<br><br>
Our greatest concern about the proposals is that the adjudicator appointed by the Secretary of State will not know the local area or be from it, but will sit in judgment over the structure of schools and decide whether to go against the decisions taken by those elected to represent the interests of the local electorate. Those interests could be cast aside by someone appointed by the Secretary of State.</span></p>
<p>10.50 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for School Standards (Ms Estelle Morris)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Cunningham. This is the first time that I have had the pleasure of being a member of a Committee that you have chaired. I hope that you will not have to do so for the full one and a half hours on this occasion.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) and I, and other hon. Members, have debated this matter several times. I accept that she is not with us in wanting to devolve decision making to local level. The power and the passion with which she defends local authorities' rights to take decision on plans hardly accords with a Government who were committed to grant-maintained schools, which took away local authorities' rights to be represented on boards of governors or to have any say in the provision
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
of education. However, the Tory party has adopted kitchen-table politics. Clearly, the first issue for discussion at the kitchen table was reintroducing local authorities' total control of the decisions taken in schools.<br><br>
I shall not go through those arguments again. It is right that the hon. Member for Maidenhead should raise them now and put them on record, and it is right that I should confirm the Government's wish to acknowledge the complex partnership that exists in the provision of schools and our wish to give all those partners a proper place in the decision-making process and to devolve decision making to local level.<br><br>
The second point made by the hon. Member for Maidenhead was that the proposal is bureaucratic. During the time that I have had the pleasure of being a Minister at the Department for Education and Employment, I have increasingly realised that things always look more bureaucratic on paper than they inevitably do in practice. Given that we are debating several statutory instruments against the background of a large Bill that was considered last year, I can understand that comment—indeed, one might have sympathy with it.<br><br>
In fact, we have set up a close structure. People know their roles within that structure and within the decision-making process. For the first time, they will know how they can influence some of the important decisions locally. They will clearly know the group in which their voice can be heard. They can rest assured that they will have a far greater say in decision making than they ever had under the previous system.<br><br>
I want to refer to some of the specific and legitimate issues raised by the hon. Member for Maidenhead. We recommend that there should be between one and seven groups. In the case that she cited in which there are only two groups, it would be possible to have seven members, because there could be more than one representative from each group. We have said that there should be between one and seven groups, but that does not mean that there should be only one, two or three if there are only one, two or three groups to be represented.<br><br>
I worked out that more than seven groups might be needed. These circumstances do not exist now, but if there were more than 5 per cent, of pupils in Jewish schools, more than 5 per cent, in Muslim schools and more than 5 per cent, in Sikh schools, the number of groups that had representation could be multiplied. The range of between one and seven is for guidance. We accept that point made by the hon. Member for Maidenhead that it is desirable to keep the number as small as possible to be efficient, but as large as possible to be representative. As she said, the right balance will differ according to the needs and make-up of the local area. Therefore, there would be no obligation to have only two schools groups in Maidenhead.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Maidenhead made an important point about special schools. It is unusual that there is no special school in the authority that covers her constituency. This is not a prediction, but I accept that that could become the case as we move towards greater inclusion. We state in the guidance that we want the interests of special educational needs children to be represented. The fact that no school is designated to look
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0604">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
after their interests in any area does not mean that there is no interest in SEN. We are keen to ensure that special educational needs are represented in schools groups by the governor of a special school, even if there is no special school in an area.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Maidenhead raised the issue of someone being the governor of both a primary and a secondary school. That is not mentioned specifically in the legislation. Surely it would have been good practice for the governor to make clear whose interest he or she was representing on the school organisation committee. I suppose that a governor might be on the governing body of all types of school, but I should not like the voice of the school organisation committee to rest with him. That would very much be a matter for local decision, and it would be a matter of good practice.<br><br>
We recommend one member only for the FEFC and that he or she does not take part in decisions that do not involve 16-plus provision. It is difficult to justify that member taking decisions about primary or secondary schools. Equally, it would not make sense not to hear his voice, when making what sometimes could be contentious and sensitive decisions about post-16 provision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. May</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It might have been a slip of the tongue, but the Minister said that the FEFC should take part only in decisions about post-16 provision. She then said that she would not expect it to take part in decisions about primary and secondary schools. However, decisions about secondary schools could also involve decisions on post-16 provision for schools with sixth forms.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. I am grateful for that clarification about such decisions in which 16-plus provision was part of the decision-making process. We said in our guidance that we expect there to be one member from the FEFC. That is not statutory procedure, but guidance and it would be for local people to plan.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Maidenhead described accurately what a school organisation committee can do with a school organisation plan. We must remember two matters: the school organisation plan is very much a contextual document; it should not name particular schools of closure, for expansion or for change. It should be an analysis of the demographic trends of the number of schools, the number of places, perhaps of the planned increase in housing provision, and an estimate of the number of three-year-olds. I should be surprised if the plan was contentious.<br><br>
The plan might be contentious only if someone questioned whether a new housing development was likely to bring X more children into the area than Y more children. I have experienced such arguments between my constituents whose predictions about new housing developments differ in terms of whether they consider them to be family housing developments.<br><br>
It is unlikely that the school organisation committee would produce its own plan. The safeguard is that the local authority is represented on the committee. I very much hope that the plans, when passed, are not as contentious as the hon. Member for Maidenhead implied. The greatest debate will be about individual closures,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
individual expansions and individual changes to an individual school. It is at that stage that agreement may fail to be reached between the parties and the adjudicator will need to be brought in.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. May</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to press the Minister about what she perceives the school organisation plan to include. If it states, for example, that given the demographics in a particular area that it expects to have X number of secondary schools and X number of primary schools—"X" being smaller than the number that exists at the time covered by the plans—that could give rise to argument because people would be asking, "Which school is going to close?".<br><br>
Another possible area of contention is where an authority says that it does not currently have a Roman Catholic or Church of England secondary school but, because of representations, it wants the Roman Catholic or Church of England diocese to take over one of the secondary schools. I should be grateful for clarification of whether such matters will be included in the plan.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As members of the Committee will know, the minute that a local authority begins to consult on a pattern of reorganisation, blight affects the schools that are named. I have struggled to overcome this problem a few times in the past 18 months, but have failed to do so. If there is consultation, a gap is left where there is indecision. I know the effect that that can have on schools that are named for closure. The only answer to that is not to consult. However, we cannot do that, so we have to try to manage as best we can.<br><br>
The suggestion of the hon. Member for Maidenhead would not be as bad because it would not name schools. It could be said that given the demography of an area, one more secondary school is needed, which might mean that local people would begin to ask where that school should be. There is a difficult balance between proper consultation and not leaving too great a time gap so that people become worried. I think that when schools are named it gets into the public domain and parents want to know how their child will be affected. I do not imagine that a school organisation plan would be hugely contentious, or hugely discussed in the local media and elsewhere, although it would be good if that were the case.<br><br>
We are always sensitive to considerations for a percentage of places to be in Roman Catholic or Church of England schools. We always try to ensure that there is not, without good reason, any reduction in the number of children who have the opportunity to go to church schools. It is a complex relationship, but all Governments since 1944 have managed successfully to provide education of a denominational character, and local authorities have an almost overriding obligation to provide sufficient places. The nature of that relationship will continue as it always has done.<br><br>
I know that the hon. Member for Maidenhead feels that she has been entirely consistent about the need for adjudicators to be local. We first talked about that a year and two month ago—I think the topic first came up in January last year. I can remember being torn, because I could see both sides of the argument. In our debate in Committee, I said that I could see the strength of knowing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0605">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
the local area, but I could also see the strength of not knowing it, so that someone would come in with a fresh mind and could judge matters as they arose. I promised the hon. Member for Maidenehad more than a year ago that we would give the matter careful thought.<br><br>
We did so, and we saw the advantage of an outsider making the decisions, partly because of manageability. We have appointed a chief adjudicator and 15 adjudicators, but do not yet know in which parts of the country most reorganisations will take place. In the past year, there have been major reorganisations in Bradford, north Tyneside and Warwickshire, and we have seen that the need for adjudicators in some areas is far greater than others. Before advertising for adjudicators, we decided that we would not tie them down or take into account where they lived.<br><br>
I am happy to put on record the strength of the view of the hon. Member for Maidenhead and the degree of sympathy that I have always had with it. The desirability for local knowledge has been outweighed by our decision that an outsider is in a better position to make a judgment. I believe that this is the proper thing to do to help with the manageability of the system.<br><br>
We have always disagreed on the last point made by the hon. Member for Maidenhead. She would prefer people to have the right of appeal to the Secretary of State. We have put in place the right to have more say and a more powerful voice in the decision in the first place. It is our hope that not as many cases will go to the adjudicator as have ended up coming to the Secretary of State. Under the old system, there was no opportunity to influence the judgment before it went for final decision. Because of the school organisation committee, the voices of these important partners will be heard with greater clarity at the point at which decisions are made locally. The adjudicator
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
will have all the power in terms of access to people, receiving delegations and even the power to set up a local inquiry before decisions are made.<br><br>
This is part of the Government's desire to see all the essential partners in education having a real say in the crucial decisions that affect children as they go through school. We have put in place a system that acknowledges that partnership and which gives proper rights, privileges, responsibilities and a strong voice to all the people who have a say. At the same time, we acknowledge the reality that whatever the structure or our wishes, those partners will not always be able to reach agreement. There will be occasions when someone outside the structure has to come in and make the final decision. It is our wish for that person to be someone who works with the partners at local level.<br><br>
I very much hope that the statutory instruments, which flesh out important legislation, will find favour with the Committee.</span></p>
