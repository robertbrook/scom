Draft Diplomatic Privileges (British Nationals) Order 1999</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Mr. Tony Lloyd)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Diplomatic Privileges (British Nationals) Order 1999.</p></blockquote>
I rise to tell this crowded and expectant Committee that the order, which was laid before the House on 28 January, revokes and replaces a number of previous orders on the same subject. It is a continuation of existing policy. It breaks no new ground. It does not introduce a change of policy, nor does it confer immunities and privileges on any new category of persons. It simply adds to the list those countries that have joined the Commonwealth since 1970. We shall thus ensure that we continue to give equal treatment to all dual national diplomats in all Commonwealth missions in London. Previous orders were made to maintain that policy.<br><br>
The original order, made in 1964, was necessary because the Diplomatic Privileges Act 1964, which gave effect in United Kingdom law to the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations, deprived British nationals and permanent residents of the UK of the full diplomatic privileges and immunities that they had previously enjoyed if they were employed in the services of the diplomatic missions of other countries.<br><br>
Since 1964, it has been the practice to accord special treatment to members of the diplomatic missions of Commonwealth countries who are nationals of the sending states and who also have British nationality. They are accorded privileges and immunities as if they were nationals of the sending state alone. That special treatment was adopted and has been continued because of the closeness of Commonwealth ties and the resultant complexity of Commonwealth nationality laws, including those of the United Kingdom.<br><br>
Diplomats with dual nationality are not as common now as they were in the past, which explains the long gap between this order and the previous one. However, the Government feel that it would be prejudicial to good Commonwealth relations for dual national diplomats from countries that joined the Commonwealth after 1970 not to be accorded the same privileges and immunities as accorded to dual national diplomats from the Commonwealth countries listed in previous orders. Although 25 countries will be added to the list by the order, I understand that a grand total of seven diplomats will benefit under the order.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
It is a simple measure. Hon. Members may wish to ask questions, but I hope that they will agree that the order is in the interests of good Commonwealth relations and that they will therefore approve it.</span></p>
<p>4.33 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Trend <span class='memberconstituency'>(Windsor)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his opening remarks. I have one or two questions about the need for the order.<br><br>
If I am right, the Diplomatic Privileges Act 1964 put into UK law article 38 of the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations. The convention deprived diplomats of Commonwealth countries of the conventional privileges of diplomatic immunity. To extend those privileges to diplomats from Commonwealth countries, a series of orders has been made. Therefore, the ambassador from southern Rhodesia was given privileges and immunities in 1964 that are now accorded to the high commissioner for Zimbabwe. Our complex colonial history can be seen through these orders.<br><br>
If I am correct, why was it done in the first place? The Minister said that they were special privileges granted to people from the Commonwealth with dual nationality—and now to such people from the Republic of Ireland. Why was a special case made, and why was it considered appropriate to maintain that special status? Might other national or supranational groups—the European Union comes to mind—benefit from such an understanding? What different privileges is one entitled to as a diplomatic representative of a Commonwealth country or of me Republic of Ireland that are not available to diplomats with dual nationality from other countries?<br><br>
I realise that my questions are complex, and that the Minister may not be able to answer them now, but I am sure that he will be able to let me know. That raises the question of why we have such a problem in the first place. It must be to do with article 38 of the Vienna convention. Have the Government given any thought to going back to the root, and proposing changes to the Vienna convention to correct those apparent anomalies?</span></p>
<p>4.36 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Heath <span class='memberconstituency'>(Somerton and Frome)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We do not oppose the order, but some minor questions must be answered. The first follows from the point made by the hon. Member for Windsor (Mr. Trend): why do we need the order? A distinction is presumably made between high commissions and embassies under the Vienna convention, but it would be far more sensible to treat diplomatic relations between Commonwealth countries in the same way as relations with other countries. Rather than making an order revising the list every time a substantive change is made in the membership of the Commonwealth, it should not be beyond the powers of parliamentary draftsmen to produce an order that applies to the membership of the Commonwealth, whatever it might be at the time, rather than listing countries separately.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0552">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
That brings me to my next question, which is about suspended membership of the Commonwealth. I note that a suspended member of the Commonwealth is listed in the schedule. It begs the question of whether a suspended member of the Commonwealth is entitled to the privileges of the order, whatever they may be. A case could be made for avoiding a repeat of the process to extend or revise the list, or to allow for suspensions or revocations of membership of the Commonwealth.<br><br>
I ask my last question because of the considerable interest shown by my hon. Friend the Member for Colchester (Mr. Russell) in the affairs of St. Helena—an interest that he has expressed on many occasions. Were the Government to announce next month that the inhabitants of St. Helena, and perhaps of other overseas territories, were to enjoy again the benefit of British nationality, and were that to be done by an Act of Parliament, it would require a further revision of article 3(2), which lists the orders under which a British national is to be considered a British national. It would be unfortunate if we had to repeat the process in the near future. We should try to avoid that, and the Minister would help the Committee by providing an alternative. Other than that, I am happy to support the order.</span></p>
<p>4.39 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall do my best to respond to the debate. Under the Vienna convention, it was possible to maintain historic privileges and special arrangements. I shall correct myself if I am wrong, but I understand that the special category was introduced in 1964 when many people in Britain were dual nationals as a result of our different immigration laws. A genuine category of people in the Commonwealth would have been disadvantaged under the Vienna convention had they not been accorded the full rights and status of diplomats in pursuing their diplomatic duties. The exemption from the norm made sense at the time in terms of nationalities and practices within the Commonwealth.<br><br>
Only a small number of diplomats from non-Commonwealth countries would have benefited from an equivalent provision and I am advised that that is still the case. The issue does not pertain to countries outside the Commonwealth—so I have answered the question whether the order would apply to the European Union or any other supranational organisation.<br><br>
The order is a tidying up exercise; we do not wish to discriminate within the Commonwealth. I am sure that members of the Committee agree that there is but one Commonwealth and that we should treat all its members on the same basis. I shall deal with suspension in a moment. It is now 29 years since the last tidying up exercise and I say gently to the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) that it is not a matter of racing into matters precipitously each time that there is a change. If changes are made every three decades, they require a more leisurely approach.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman was right to point out that there might be a reason for change if there were changes to the nationality laws, but I can only repeat what my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary said in the Chamber and say
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
that I cannot anticipate the White Paper, and certainly not legislative change at this stage. If such change is necessary, it will require primary legislation. It would not be too difficult to tidy up the order in the event of major changes. However, to date, such matters are hypothetical.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Heath</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not saying that we should revise the order. However, would it not be more simple to have an order that enacted the provisions of the Vienna convention for any country, for any diplomatic mission and for anyone with British nationality, however described at the time, rather than specifying it in such terms that it must be revised when circumstances change.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am certainly prepared to consider that suggestion and examine whether such action can be taken generically for the Commonwealth or whether we should extend it more generally. However, I shall not make a commitment now as there may be technical reasons why such practice is not desirable. In any case, it may be technically impossible to treat the Commonwealth generically rather than to accept countries with diplomatic relations on a bilateral, not a group, basis. I undertake to come back to the hon. Gentleman about that.<br><br>
Nigeria is currently suspended from the Commonwealth but, given our relations with that country, a clear signal has legitimately been given to it that a recommendation will be made to Commonwealth heads of Government on the completion of a free and fair presidential election there and progress towards the inauguration of a civilian president. It is assumed that Commonwealth membership will be restored under those circumstances. I think that the Committee and indeed the country would want us at least to prepare Nigeria for re-admittance into the Commonwealth.<br><br>
The measure is a relatively minor one, and I must emphasise that it affects very small numbers of people. In the event of legislative change in respect of the dependent territories that meant that many dual national diplomats of those territories came under the provision—if it turns out, for example, that many Nigerians would be affected—we would have to reconsider.<br><br>
I must respond to the question about what the order provides. Effectively, it puts those who are de facto accredited diplomats and who have dual nationality status at one with all other accredited diplomats. It also puts dual nationals employed by diplomatic missions in different roles—as servants, for example—in the same position as mono-nationals so that they enjoy the same privileges. Such people would not receive full diplomatic immunity, but would be given parity under the taxation system and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trend</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister have any idea of the thinking at Vienna? Why were nationals of one state who were also nationals of the receiving state deemed unfit to enjoy the customary diplomatic immunities and privileges? Why was that provision introduced in the first place?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that I could entertain the Committee by speculating on that, although I am not sure how helpful that would be. It is remiss of me not to know

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
the answer—I did not create die situation, but simply inherited it. Again, I undertake to make inquiries. I shall sidle up to the hon. Member for Windsor at some stage of me proceedings in this great institution of ours and inform him of my findings. If other hon. Members want die same information, I shall make it freely available.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
I think that I have answered all the questions. If I have not, I shall read die report of our debate and try to rectify my omissions.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Draft Diplomatic Privileges (British Nationals) Order 1999.</p></blockquote></p>
