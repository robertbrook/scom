	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Eleanor Laing 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Epping Forest)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><q><p>"That the Committee has considered the Education (Education Standards Etc. Grants) (England) Regulations 1999 (S.I. 1999, No. 606).</p></q>
I begin by sending Committee members the apologies of my hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May), who normally leads for the Opposition in the many Committees that consider education matters. She is unavoidably engaged elsewhere this afternoon, and is very sorry not to be here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I gather that there is a general consensus among Committee members that brevity is of the essence this afternoon, [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] I am glad that I have the agreement of Labour Members. My speech will not take long because I have only a few, albeit important, points to make, and I am sure that the Under-Secretary will answer my questions equally briefly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to the regulations, Opposition Members are concerned about the fact that a considerable sum is held by the Government in the Department for Education and Employment and distributed to local education authorities and schools. The Government use their own priorities rather than those of LEAs and schools. They may use that system intentionally—they are entitled to take a view and to carry out their policies accordingly. However, that system is inconsistent with the constant calls that we hear for devolution and for giving power to the people or institutions at, as it were, the grass roots rather than the centre. If decentralisation is the aim, why are the Government continuing, in these regulations and in others, to place power and finance at the centre?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When local management of schools was first introduced some years ago, financial autonomy was devolved to head teachers and away from LEAs. I well remember that the considerable sums that were saved could be spent directly on education at the chalk face rather than on administration. All those who were involved, especially those at the local level, regarded that policy as being correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule 8(1) give carte blance to the Secretary of State to "determine further conditions" in relation to future payments. Given that the regulations already contain many conditions, why was that power felt to be necessary? The Secretary of State can use that power if he wishes. Will an appropriate amendment be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
considered in the House or in a Standing Committee? Will the power involve democratic input in any way, or will decisions be rubber-stamped by the Department?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations list 68 categories of expenditure—a large number—which will be covered by standards fund bids and which will be decided by the Government, who will be able to establish their own priorities. Is there any mechanism by which the Government can listen to local authorities or head teachers when deciding what further priorities there should be?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further concern is the bidding process and the amount of money that is being distributed from the centre through that process. The standards fund money must all be bid for by local educaiton authorities, if my reading of clause 6(1) is correct. I am sure that the Minister will tell me if that is not so. Such a bidding process is time consuming and expensive. It is in the best interests of the children to whom we are trying to give the best possible education to spend so much time, effort and money on the bidding process, rather than giving autonomy of expenditure to the school itself?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know, from speaking to head teachers in my constituency, how much they are able to achieve when given the ability to respond to changing circumstances and to deal with crises and problems that arise in their own school and their own area. When they have the financial ability to deal with those problems, they can do it quickly and well. However, if they have to go through the whole bidding process, it will take financial resources away from the chalk face, and also take up a great deal of time. Sometimes, problems arise that have to be dealt with quickly—particularly in special needs cases. It makes sense to give autonomy to the head teacher to deal with such problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A written answer in 	<i>Hansard</i> on 22 April 1999 at column 	<i>682</i> makes it clear that of a total 8,714 bids—not just standards fund bids, but bids generally—received by the Department for Education and Employment since November 1998, only 2,998 have been successful. I am not complaining about the ratio of bids to success—that is probably fair enough. However, I question the amount of time, money and other resources that went into those unsuccessful bids, of which there were more than 5,000. Those schools or LEAs thought that they had a reasonable case for bidding for the extra resources that they needed. Not only were they unsuccessful in obtaining them, but they wasted time, money and effort in the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have two other matters to address concerning some anomalies in the regulations. It appears that under schedule 1(2)(a), if compared with schedule 1(2)(b), there will be a 100 per cent. grant for training someone to become a head teacher, but only a 50 per cent. grant for training a head teacher in post. I am sure that there is a reason why the regulations have been drafted in this way—we should like to know what it is. It seems rather strange. There is also an anomaly in schedule 1(3)(a), when compared with schedule 1(3)(b), in that there is once again a 100 per cent. grant for an advanced skills teacher in a specialist school, whereas an AST in a non-specialist school attracts only a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0334">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
50 per cent. grant. It has recently been reported that schools in the north-east are finding it difficult to afford ASTs at all. If ASTs are a key plank in the Government's policy, why are there not 100 per cent. grants for them throughout?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I promised to be brief. I have stated our general objection to the regulations, which is that they represent more money down the drain into bureaucracy, instead of going directly to where it helps teachers and their pupils. It is a pity that the Government have decided to create yet more piles of paper. I worry about the number of regulations that pass over the desks of head teachers and other teachers, who should be spending their time getting on with teaching, instead of dealing with more and more bureaucracy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.41 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Willis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harrogate and Knaresborough)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Benton. I come here a disappointed man, having visited the Pre-School Learning Alliance's exhibition of pictures by Members of Parliament only to find that I have not been selected for any of the awards. I now know what it feels like to fail an Ofsted inspection. However, as no other member of the Committee has won an award either, I am in illustrious company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is wonderful to witness the hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mrs. Laing) continue the regeneration of the Tory party by learning from its mistakes. I worked for 18 years as a head teacher under Conservative Governments and experienced nothing but attacks on local education authorities and schools. Now the Conservative party supports LEAs and wants them to be given much more support. I know that the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Mrs. Browning) will support me in those comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Angela Browning 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tiverton and Honiton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not necessarily.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also intend to be brief. We have several concerns, but the principal one follows from work in Committee yesterday: the regulations are yet another example of enormous central control of resources. Such a measure has never been proposed to the House of Commons. It was not a Labour manifesto pledge to set up a standards fund to control and distribute money centrally. The hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson) shakes his head, because he agrees. Never during the past two years, despite two major Acts and umpteen discussions of Government policy on education, education, education, has the House had the opportunity to discuss the fundamental issue of the standards fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the basis of our opposition to the regulations and the Government's actions. If they had the support of the House; if we had had an opportunity to debate the central policy of a standards fund, we would come to the regulations in a different frame of mind. Central Government will have a tool with which to control every aspect of spending in an individual school anywhere in England or Wales. Fortunately, the Scots
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
have been able to escape, and provided that they get a superb coalition government including the Liberal Democrats, they can decide policy for themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I counted 72 categories in schedule 1; but let us not split hairs, if there are 68, I will settle for that. In the past two years, 72 categories of bidding have been introduced. The hon. Member for Epping Forest is absolutely right: where will we be after four years? Every aspect of expenditure in schools could be controlled by the standards fund, if the Government choose. Why not be honest and go the whole hog? Why do not the Government say that they will control all schools and their expenditure centrally? Then we can have an honest debate on the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Epping Forest mentioned the bidding process. There is not one LEA that does not have constant complaints from officers and head teachers about the amount of time spent on the process. My hon. Friend the Member for Bath (Mr. Foster), who sadly is not here today, has had a crusade on the matter. The Minister has been singularly unable to respond to why it is necessary to have this level of bidding. It is all right for the winners—they go away happy because they have obtained the money that they need for their project. That is superb, except when it comes to auditing it. Auditing where the money goes, with the LEA auditing it via the schools, is yet another bureaucratic burden on the schools. It increases the level of bureaucracy and control under the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about the losers? What support will they get for the enormous waste of resources? Has the Minister's Department calculated what it cost in the last financial year to put together those bids? What is the waste of money for all those schools and LEAs which have not spent the money? Yesterday, we had a debate on being open and accountable regarding expenditure. There should be a column in the LEAs' budget profile to show how much is spent on bidding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's announcement on music was a late addition to the list. Despite the huge and savage cuts imposed by the previous Government, my local authority, North Yorkshire, maintained a first-class music education service for all our youngsters. It was not only for the wealthy and those who could afford it; it was a comprehensive music service, and I complimented North Yorkshire on it. It was spending about £650,000 on the service. It had already set its budget when the Government decided to give it 100 per cent. relief. North Yorkshire was delighted. I compliment the Minister on recognising the strength of its music education and giving it 100 per cent. relief. But how can a local authority programme its budgeting process if decisions are being made so late? Can we have a system whereby the standards fund is allocated at the same time as local authorities receive their grant settlement, so that we know matters are clear and open, if the Government are to continue down that road?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right. I am delighted to hear that music education in Yorkshire thrived so wonderfully under the previous Conservative Government. Having heard the hon. Gentleman speak on previous occasions about their education record, I accept the compliment that he has clearly paid today to the former Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the hon. Gentleman, I am sadly disappointed that my painting was not singled out as a work or art to be recognised in the House of Commons. I have to say that I was provided only with a very thick brush and five primary colours. It has not gone unnoticed that others had pastels and very thin brushes, but never mind. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> There will be a private viewing, as there is obviously much interest in my masterpiece—rather in the style of Monet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Epping Forest has clearly outlined our concerns about the regulations. The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough is quite right in his general summary about their genesis. It comes from the Schools Standards and Framework Act 1998. Those of us who considered it in Committee know only too well how much we would have liked to discuss in Committee the sort of detail that we were continually asking the Minister to make available to the House at the time, rather than seeing it before us now as secondary legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I seek clarification from the Minister on some regulations, apart from those that my hon. Friend has mentioned. Regulation 4 deals with
	<br><q><p>"Standards funds grants in respect of payments to third parties".</p></q>
I am especially concerned about how much of the money, which is to raise standards in schools, is siphoned off for administration and other such charges. Siphoning may take place when third parties are involved. Alternatively, it has often become the practice of local authorities specifically to recruit staff for one project, especially for pilot, one-off or annual schemes such as those where there is bidding for grants. In other words, local authorities do not use their indigenous resources to mitigate the administrative costs, but take on additional staff or outside consultants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to give some information on how he sees the payment of such bills as either reasonable or unreasonable. Throughout the statutory instrument, there are references to the need for audited certificates and for payment to be generated. I do not disagree with that principle, but I would like to know how moneys for third parties will be audited and what the Minister regards as reasonable in terms of the percentage of the administrative charge to the overall grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough mentioned schedule 1, about which I seek one or two points of clarification from the Minister. Paragraph 4 reads:
	<br><q><p>"Support for measures to assist the recruitment and retention of teachers."</p></q>
Any Government who purport to raise standards should consider the universality of a standard in education. It seems wrong that a bidding process should mean that some are able to achieve a standard that they themselves have set and targeted. There will be winners and losers, and we must therefore assume that the losers in the bidding process will not be expected to achieve the standards of the gainers. If any issues will be key to how standards are improved in school, they will be on a subject such as the
	<br><q><p>"Support for measures to assist the recruitment and retention of teachers."</p></q>
I shall focus on the legislation on the maximum of 30 children in a primary class at key stage 1, which has been in place for some time, enabling us to make some examination of it. The Government made it not only part of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, but one of their key pledges at the previous election. In order to meet it, many schools, some with and some without financial support, have recruited extra teachers. In the previous academic year, recruitment of a teacher was forthcoming in my constituency, but I have heard that in two of its primary schools, those teachers may not be retained from September onwards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is unfair to children. Continuity is especially helpful for children in that age group, especially in small village primary schools such as in my Devonshire constituency. Lack of retention also seems unfair to teachers themselves. I shall now make a point to the Minister that I made to the Minister for School Standards, the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Ms Morris), when debating a previous statutory instrument that also touched on the issue of recruitment and retention of teachers. If teachers are to be offered such contracts, surely it is only fair that it is made clear when they sign that they could be temporary. She denied that there was any need to point that out to teachers, but there will be a lot of hiring and firing, especially when the funding for a teacher's salary will not be a continuing determinant, year on year. I hope that the Minister will consider that again, now that the first year's experience is in place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 7(e) of schedule 1 deals with
	<br><q><p>"support for the training of specialist teacher assistants"</p></q>
and says that
	<br><q><p>"that it is to say persons who can provide assistance and support for teachers in teaching subjects including reading and writing".</p></q>
Will the Under-Secretary clarify the meaning of assistance to teachers? Does it mean a separate category of teacher or someone whom we perhaps both would recognise as a classroom assistant with some training? Concern has been expressed by primary schools that they are having to dispense with classroom assistants to meet their current budgets. What category of teacher or assistant is covered by the schedule?

Paragraph 12 of schedule 1 refers to
	<br><q><p>"Support in establishing and maintaining study support centres within, or near, the premises of Premier League and First Division Football Clubs."</p></q>
I am all in favour of the provision; I am not in dispute with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not in Devon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman please not denigrate football in Devon? My local team, Tiverton Town, will be playing at Wembley on Sunday. It is in the final of the FA Vase and next season, I expect it to play in the Dr. Marten's league—not an inconsiderable feat. Opposition Members may laugh, but I have been a Member of Parliament for seven years and it will be the first time that I have had the privilege of seeing my local football team play at Wembley in a final. Surely that is a mark of what it can contribute to its local community—it also needs some money for a new stand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those in rural areas will not have access to a Premier league or first division football club. All pupils should have the same access to sporting and coaching facilities that bring them into contact with their local teams. The need in rural areas for those facilities is as great as it is in the inner cities. I hope that the Under-Secretary will ensure that, regardless of where children live, they have access to such centres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 27(a) of the schedule deals with music. I only heard last week that music services in Devon are to be cut dramatically. What assessment will the Under-Secretary make in providing support for music? Will he examine those LEAs that are reducing music provision this year? What will be the criteria for the bidding? As the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough said, some education authorities have a good track record and, I hope, will continue to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in other parts of the country, such as the county of Devon, concern has already been expressed about this year's music provision. I cannot be an apologist for my LEA, which is a Liberal Democrat-controlled authority, but I am worried about the reduction in music lessons in Devon. Will the Minister make up the shortfall in that service?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The schedule deals also with teacher training and teacher centres. Again, will the Under-Secretary consider the rural dimension? Many primary school teachers, particularly in far-flung, small villages, have to travel to the nearest big city for training and that takes them away from the classroom for an unnecessary length of time. I am sorry to be parochial, but the size of my constituency is 600 square miles and it covers 90 parishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have fought for a long time to keep open the teacher centre in Tiverton in mid-Devon. It is much prized and valued by teachers and they would prefer to continue to go somewhere locally to train than have to give up even more classroom teaching time by being forced to train in the urban cities. In considering the management of teacher centres, I hope that the Under-Secretary will take into account the rural dimension as well as the need for teachers to have training but to be out of the classroom for the minimum amount of time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
	<p>4.59 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mr. Charles Clarke)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have enjoyed this little discussion. The attitude of hon. Members to the important competition held by the Pre-School hearing Alliance summed up, as well as anything could, the different attitudes of the parties. The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough, a Liberal Democrat, said that he did not know why he had lost, and why his painting was not included. He simply could not understand it. The hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton came out with a string of excuses—the traditional Conservative position—blaming the brushes, the paint, the pastels and goodness knows what. I also entered the competition, and I also failed to win. I shall honestly and bluntly tell the Committee the reason why—my painting was not good enough. I am prepared to face that and deal with reality. That is in contrast to the escapism of the Liberal Democrats and the excuses of the Conservatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was also sorry that the hon. Member for Maidenhead could not be here today, as she had prayed against the regulations. For a moment, I thought that she was making a political statement, in the light of the issues currently being discussed in the Conservative party. No Committee member has so far pointed out that the purpose of the regulations under discussion is to authorise spending of nearly £1 billion on improving education standards throughout the country. In the light of remarks by her right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley) about the viability and importance of education spending, I wondered whether there might be a surreptitious division between those who were prepared to come to the Committee to support the expenditure, such as the hon. Member for Epping Forest, and those who stayed away to avoid controversy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Laing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make it clear that all Conservative Members support good education standards. We always aimed for such standards while in government, and we continue to do so. We are trying to help the Government to do the best for every child in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that the hon. Lady rose to the fly that I cast on the surface. The Conservative party's verbal commitment to education standards is clear, but the issue is supporting additional resources to make that commitment real. That is what the regulations before the Committee are all about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Epping Forest began by asking whether money was being distributed according to Government priorities. We plead guilty to that. We have a rang of priorities, which are set out in schedule 1. The hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Mrs. Browning) raised some of them. They include the numeracy strategy, the literacy strategy, early excellence centres, advanced skills teachers, family literacy, family numeracy, special education needs, the national grid for learning, ethnic minority
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0337">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
achievement and music services. We unashamedly believe that we need to put resources and money into those areas, and that the purpose is to raise education standards. I do not apologise one iota for that. We were elected on the slogan of "education, education, education", and it is right that we are living up to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The spending is additional to the regular spending that comes through the standard spending assessment settlement and the regular settlement. It will enable schools and local authorities to devote extra resources to the tasks set out in schedule 1. Some might argue that resources should not be so devoted, that all the money should go through the local education authority system and that nothing should be added to the standards fund. I disagree with that. I could point to the precedent of the previous Government, who also used direct funding, but we need to leave such petty points aside. The Government have priorities and means of achieving them, which are set out openly, directly, fully and clearly to enable proper debate and discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall go through the points made by the hon. Member for Epping Forest one by one. Regulation 8(1) states:
	<br><q><p>"The Secretary of State may from time to time determine further conditions on the fulfilment of which the making of any payment under these Regulations shall be dependent."</p></q>
First, that condition was included in the previous recommendations under the previous Government, but leaving that aside, I want to give a couple of examples that might help the hon. Lady. Yesterday, in Committee, we were talking about the issue raised by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough of informing school governors and head teachers about their standards fund allocation. No doubt, I shall read tomorrow that it was a Liberal Democrat game. However, we are actively considering ways of ensuring that the full standards fund allocation for each school is available to the governors and head of the school before the financial year starts, so that they are able to plan their budgets. I accept the point that many people have made about the need for schools to have the information early enough to be able to plan their budgets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Epping Forest asked what conditions we might impose. Let me give her an example. We might want to impose a condition on a local education authority to make information and money available to schools so that the position was clear. The power under which we would impose such a condition is set out in regulation 8(1). To give a further example, we have allocated substantial resources to the national grid for learning and we are actively considering several specific conditions to ensure that there is an open-access system throughout the country, so that cartels are not created in certain areas. Those are the sorts of matters that will arise as the process continues. The power in regulation 8(1)—which is similar to the powers in previous legislation—is important in order to ensure that money is well spent. It has not nefarious purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister not accept that 16 of the 35 official categories require a 50 per cent. contribution from local education authorities, and that, therefore, the Government are not simply spending top-up money, but requiring LEAs to make a commitment to those 16 areas? In fact, all the others, apart from 14, which command a 100 per cent. contribution from the Government, require a commitment from the LEA. That goes further than what the Minister said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is true that a commitment in varying percentages is required from LEAs in relation to the different levels of standard fund grant. I shall deal with that in a moment when we discuss the alleged bidding process that has been referred to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the regulation is to ensure that money is well spent. Some might say that it is somehow wrong for the Government to require an LEA that is making a 50 per cent. contribution to a particular area to inform schools in its authority, by a particular date, how much it has spent, and that it should be a matter for the LEA. We must agree to differ on that. I believe that it is reasonable for the Government to lay down certain conditions. If the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough were to argue that it would be good practice, good government and good administration to resolve those matters as early as possible so that people knew the situation, I would agree with him. That it is a correct and valid point. However, it is always the way that we learn from experience and move forward. Regulation 8(1) gives us the power to continue to develop the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reponse to the further point made by the hon. Member for Epping Forest, we widely consult head teachers and LEAs on various aspects of the standards fund. Many areas are the subject of a substantial consultation process, in which a considerable number of representations are made, and which we genuinely take into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now turn to regulation 6(1) and the alleged bidding process, to which the hon. Member for Epping Forest and others referred. The regulation does not set out a bidding process, it sets out an application process—the process for making a claim. For exactly the reasons set out by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough, in the case of many of the funds, the LEA must make a contribution—sometimes 50 per cent. and sometimes a different proportion—and the LEA must indicate that it wishes to take advantage of the allocation made to it. When it considers its budget, it will decide whether it is in a position to do that. Some LEAs decide not to apply for the money—not many of them, because they mostly think that it is a good thing—but some, for reasons of ideology, or because they feel that they do not have the resources, decide not to apply. Regulation 6(1) states that the money will not be paid unless the LEA asks for it. That is not an onerous requirement. Again, I make the partisan point that previous legislation under previous Governments established that requirement. It is good practice and we should welcome it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0338">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
Issues have been raised concerning a bidding process, which is not covered in regulation 6(1). It is true that, in some of the lines in the regulation, local education authorities bid for a sum of money, but the process is quite rare. Substantial amounts of the standards fund are not bid in competitions but allocated automatically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give examples of cases that involved a bidding process. I am familiar with the national grid for learning and with local education authority submissions for information and computer technology. To begin with, the process was extremely patchy. Some LEAs were outstanding and deserved support because they had put together worthwhile propositions, but others were a long way off the pace. Had we allocated money to them, they would not have spent it properly and resources would have been wasted. Therefore, we began a bidding process, which has improved quality over successive years. Those authorities now submit coherent and innovative plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other lines are not subject to a bidding process and there is room for party political or internal argument about the desirability of bidding at each line. The bidding to which the hon. Member for Epping Forest referred in a parliamentary answer on 22 April, quoted in column 682 of 	<i>Hansard,</i> concerned capital funds. I have responsibility for the new deal for schools, for which there were about 5,000 applications—I am speaking from memory—of which about 1,000 were granted. Eighteen years of Conservative Government underinvestment has created a massive hole, which we are trying to plug by allocating money. A large proportion of the numbers referred to in the parliamentary answer were bidding for the capital process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Laing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of clarification, is the Under-Secretary saying that, although there are bidding processes for capital expenditure and other purposes, the mechanism in the regulation is not a bidding process but an application process, and that there is, within reason, no competition? If an application fulfils the conditions in the regulations, will the money be paid?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am not saying that. Regulation 6(1), to which she referred, is concerned with the formal application process. It is not a question of competitive bidding, but of whether an LEA decides to undertake the application process. However, in a significant number of the lines set out in schedule 1—I have not calculated the figure—there is an automatic allocation formula with no competitive bidding. However, for the reason I described, in some lines, there is a competitive bidding process, but it is not referred to in regulation 6(1).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I made the separate point that there is a bidding process for capital spending, which has nothing to do with the regulations. The matter was dealt with in the parliamentary answer to which I referred earlier. The hon. Member for Epping Forest said that there is bidding in the system, which is true in respect of various lines, and we can discuss the question of what might be advisable. However, the regulation to which
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
she referred is not concerned with a general bidding process, but with LEAs applying for money allocated to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Under-Secretary accept that, if the pot of money for which LEAs bid is cash limited by the Government, as it clearly is, there will be winners and losers? Whatever semantics are used in the Committee to label that—bidding, applications, or whatever—we are not talking about the building of a school, but the standards of education that the Government have identified as being the appropriate standards for children across an age range and a spectrum. Is the Government's declared policy that there is a standard of education for children per se? If so, does the Under-Secretary not accept that for there to be winners and losers, whatever one calls them, flies in the face of any policy that could be described as being fair and just to children, because it will be fair and just to some children but not others?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady's argument flies in the face of the history of past Conservative Governments in many respects. However, I shall put that trivial and crude political point to one side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Her argument could be made against any bidding of any kind in relation to education revenue. It is a legitimate argument, but I do not accept it. The bidding process can often raise standards of quality in schools and local education authorities. The hon. Lady's argument about winners and losers is simply that there should be no bidding of any kind whatsoever in any circumstances. Plenty of people take that view—that there should be some automatic process by which money is supplied, full stop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would argue that in the interests of general improvement of public sector management not only in education but more generally a bidding process can be of value in raising standards of the public services that are provided. That applies whether one is talking about capital funding, or, as in this case, revenue funding. I accept that there is both a general argument—in which I would make the case that bidding can often be valuable—and a specific argument about whether bidding is a good idea in relation to a particular form of expenditure. I do not accept the hon. Lady's view if I correctly understood it—that bidding for revenue expenditure is wrong and divisive in all circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Epping Forest asked about schedule 1(2)(a) and (b), which cover the different situations for different types of head teachers. The reason for that difference is straightforward. Schedule 1(2)(a) refers to
	<br><q><p>"Support for the assessment and training of persons undertaking the National Professional Qualification for Headship".</p></q>
Such courses tend to be more expensive and last for quite a long time, sometimes well over a year. In many cases, qualified heads may move to another LEA immediately after the training. We took the view in those cases—because it is a long-term matter, expenditure is more heavy and it is possible that the head may immediately move to another LEA—that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0339">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
we should support it 100 per cent. rather than making a general commitment for the training of serving head teachers, where we feel that 50 per cent. commitment from the LEA is reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second issue that the hon. Member for Epping Forest raised concerned schedule 1(3)(a) and (b), which deal with advanced skills teachers in specialist schools. We are expanding the specialist schools programme. There are many technology specialist schools, as well as an increasing number of language, arts and sports specialist schools. One of the responsibilities that a specialist school takes on when it agrees to the bidding process to become such a school is to help spread its expertise, for example in language teaching, to other schools in the locality by a variety of different means. We see that as being very important. Specialist schools have an obligation not only to their own pupils and themselves, but to focus on excellence in the teaching of their specialist subject. That pedagogic element is very important. That is the reason for the provisions relating to advanced skills teachers—the people attached to specialist schools who can spread their skill explicitly and directly. That is the reason for the differential about which the hon. Lady asked in her intervention. I think that I have covered all the points that she made. All that remains is to end my ignorance and to ask whether she entered a painting in the Pre-School Learning Alliance competition and whether she did well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Laing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can give an immediate answer. I well recall being required at school to do paintings in the art room every week—I never got high marks then, and so I knew that there was no chance that a painting that I submitted to the competition could win a prize. I am disappointed to learn that no member of the Committee won a prize.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should perhaps give credit to the hon. Lady for her a priori realism in herself in frankly addressing the issues. I had the same inhibitions about painting, but as a Minister in the Department for Education and Employment, I had no choice about entering the competition. I look forward, with trepidation, to seeing my picture on display.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that I have addressed the general points about the bidding process raised by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough. They were not dissimilar to those raised by the hon. Member for Epping Forest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government deserve credit for making such an application concerning music in an attempt to remedy past problems. A major difference has been made to music services in schools. I acknowledge the criticism that that measure came late—we had to fight to get a negotiation process to get the money. Most of the schools and local education authorities concerned would have preferred to have the money late in the financial year than not to have it at all. I accept the general injunction of the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough about the desirability of getting
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
information out early—that is obviously true. However, he identified the major issue of focussing on music services across the range.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have got extra resources, and I am happy to give a commitment that we shall continue to look at the question in substantial detail to establish how music education is being delivered. The hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton asked about that matter. Over many years, there has been a steady decline in music education; we want to reverse that sad decline. We have allocated resources through the standard fund to help do that, but we consider seriously the legitimate question of how to ensure that that money is spent in the right way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can give the hon. Lady the assurance that she is looking for—we shall keep our methods under close review. I am genuinely interested in her views, based on her experience, on how we should proceed. By making that suggestion, I assume that she agrees that we are spending that money, and that she goes along with her deputy leader, the right hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady also asked about regulation 4, which deals with payments to third parties. I do not think that the regulation is principally concerned with administration; it concerns people providing services and resources. I shall turn to the important case of Tiverton shortly. An example would be of a football club that provides a study support centre—I have been to some excellent such centres—at which costs are involved. The regulation would empower payments to be made to a football club, rather than being routed via the local education authority. That provision is intended to aid efficiency, among other reasons. The points made about audits are correct, and well taken. The financial conditions set out in regulations 6 to 8 cover that situation rigorously, and work well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall respond to the other points raised by the hon. Lady in the order in which they were made. She made a general point about the bidding regime in relation to regulation 1, which deals with the recruitment and retention of teachers. She will know from her experience that recruitment and retention vary significantly by geographical location as well as by subject area. There are more serious problems in teacher recruitment in some parts of the country than in others. That is well documented in the work of the Teacher Training Agency. One of the purposes of the regulation is to enable us to target areas in which recruitment problems are the most serious. It is important for us to have that facility. I heard her general injunctions against bidding, but that instance provides a good example of our need to have the power to target areas in which problems are greatest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of clarification, I shall say that I was not chiefly concerned with problems of geographic spread. Now that applications will be made for awards that carry with them the money to pay the salary of a teacher recruited for a specific purpose, one must assume that such money will not be on-going, because it will be time limited. Surely it is fair to make that clear to teachers when they are recruited. It would be grossly unfair not to do so. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0340">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
Government will have to find money to deal with the unemployment of relocation of teachers who have been employed on short-term contracts because the money financing their employment was time and cash limited.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was going to address that specific point. Perhaps my respect for teachers is greater than that of the hon. Lady, but I believe that the concept of a contract is well understood by most teachers and that they understand what the situation is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a former teacher of higher education. I ask the Minister to withdraw that remark.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I withdraw any personal allegation. It does not show respect to teachers, however, to suggest that they are not intelligent enough clearly to understand the nature of a contract that they sign. Most people understand employment contracts and the key terms within them, including the length of employment involved, which is a very important aspect. I expressed surprise about the hon. Lady's remarks because I am not aware of any evidence suggesting that teachers are any less competent than most people at understanding the nature of a contract that they sign in fact, I suspect that they are more competent at doing so. I was seeking only to make that point, which applies to teachers in higher education as it does to those in schools. People understand such things, and it is demeaning to teachers to suggest that the issues need to be pointed out to them in a special way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to press the Under-Secretary, but I must tell him that I raised it with his colleague the Mininster of State during consideration of a statutory instrument. I asked her the following question, and I hope that he understands my reasons for doing so. If a .teacher signs a contract of employment whose terms and conditions are set out in the same way as in a permanent contract—inasmuch as any contract is permanent—is it not right that it should be pointed out that the employment is funded from a pot of money that is cash and time limited when the employer knows that that is the case?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That question is no reflection of any view about teachers. I make the same point that I asked the Under-Secretary's colleague to address. I do not think that the terms in which the funding of employment have been agreed are pointed out to teachers invited to apply for a post and to sign a contract—I think that they should be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have little to add to what I said earlier, and to what I think that my hon. Friend the Minister of State would have said in response to that point. A contract is a contract is a contract. People understand contracts. Of course, a whole series of issues surround contracts, relating to how they were reached, their conditions and so on. Those are perfectly legitimate points for consideration. I would be interested in any evidence that the hon. Lady has to the contrary, but when employers and employees agree a contract of employment in this or any other type of job, they are clear about the nature of the contract and about what
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
is involved. A contract of employment for one type of work may be different from that for another. That is a straightforward point, and I apologise if I have misunderstood the hon. Lady. I do not think that I have, however, and I think that she is suggesting that there are contextual factors that either the employer, the employee or other people do not understand. I doubt that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Laing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had understood the matter, but I do not after listening to the exchange between the Under-Secretary and my hon. Friend. I have never been a teacher, but I was once a lawyer. There was a time when I understood contracts of employment and various conditions within them. I am now completely confused. Is the Under-Secretary saying that if a teacning position is offered and the authority knows that funding for it will not be ad infinitum—or even for the foreseeable future—but sufficient only for a short time, that condition is not made clear to the person who is about to be employed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know any post that is ad infinitum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Laing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reasonable future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to cross swords with a lawyer because the contracts are beneficial to the legal profession. My point is limited. A contract of employment is a contract of employment. There is an obligation on anyone who signs a contract of employment—the employee or the employer—to understand the nature of the contract. People usually understand the nature of the contract that they sign, including the contextual matters. It could be argued that in all contracts of employment, the employer should be specific about the future prospects of the job. That would apply to public sector jobs, such as an LEA that employs a teacher, or to Ford at Halewood. However, I believe that most employers and employees would find that a strange argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My simple, straightforward point is that the contract of employment exists. The suggestion that some parties to a contract do not understand its nature is, in my experience, wrong. Perhaps it would be best to pursue this matter outside the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 7(e) relates to specialist teacher assistants, not teacher specialist support staff. It allows for the training of what the hon. Member for Epping Forest might regard as specialist classroom assistants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many local authorities—North Yorkshire is a good example—are working against the Government's policy on classroom assistants. The single-status agreement, which was introduced two years ago, is coming to fruition. The way in which it is being applied by the Conservative county council in North Yorkshire means that classroom assistants are facing a 24 per cent. pay cut or the loss of their jobs. That undermines the need to give support and training, which we wholeheartedly support, to a group of people whose valuable work has been forgotten by many LEAs. Will the Under-Secretary look into what is happening in North Yorkshire and other authorities

that are hammering our special needs assistants and classroom assistants by the pernicious implementation of the single-status agreement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that point. I am not a lawyer, so I am not fully informed on the single-status agreement, but I will consider the problem.

The Green Paper makes a positive commitment to employing more classroom assistants, developing their role through training and providing different ways for them to become qualified teachers. I hope that its proposals will be brought before the House when they are finalised.

On football, I, too, congratulate Tiverton on playing at Wembley. I cannot promise to be there to support the team, but I am well aware of its tremendous achievement. We focused on the premier league and first division clubs because we had to start somewhere. The people and players involved in those clubs excite their communities. I have opened two programmes—at Swindon Town and Crystal Palace—and found the experience to be exhilerating, as have my colleagues. The programme at Newcastle United, which was the first in the country, saw a massive improvement in educational achievements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The programme and partnerships, which have been exciting and imaginative, would not have taken place without the standards fund and the determination to make them work. I will consider how we can extend the programme to parts of the country that do not have the quality of football teams that we have in Norwich. We had to start somewhere, and we are trying to drive the proposal forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Laing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that the word "premises", which appears in paragraph 12, is not limited to the ground at which a football club plays,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
and that it includes a club's training ground? I ask because my constituency contains a training ground but not the ground at which the team plays.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The word "premises" is applicable to the wide range of premises that are available. The facilities that I have seen were in stadiums. I am surprised that football clubs can find the necessary space—although they have done so, they have had to make sacrifices. The answer to the hon. Lady's question is yes, the word covers all premises.

The final point that the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton raised related to teacher training and teacher centres in the country. She made a perfectly fair point, and we shall consider the matter as the situation develops. I hope that the relevant LEA will take the issue seriously. Its obligation is to examine the full range of options and to establish the best way to give teacher training to teachers. There are various ways of doing that, including, these days, information and computer technology. When the Open university was first established, teachers were the largest group to pioneer distance learning, which they did in relation to teacher training. Many important issues are involved in that context.

I am sorry that I have gone on at length. However, I did not want my political opponents to be able to argue that I had not answered their questions as honestly and directly as I could. In the spirit of the speech that was made by the right hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden, I hope that Opposition Members will support the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
