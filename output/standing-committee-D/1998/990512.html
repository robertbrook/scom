Financial Statement and Budget Report 1999–2000 and the Economic and Fiscal Strategy Report 1999–2000</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ms Patricia Hewitt)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Financial Statement and Budget Report 1999–2000 and the Economic and Fiscal Strategy Report 1999–2000 for the purposes of their approval under section 5 of the European Communities (Amendment) Act 1993.</p></blockquote>
As part of the process for multilateral surveillance in the European Union, the Government are required to send a report to the European Commission setting out our main economic policy measures. The procedure is set out in articles 103 and 104c of the Maastricht treaty, which relate to the broad economic guidelines and the excessive deficits procedure respectively.<br><br>
I am aware that, in the last year's debate, my predecessor participated in a lively discussion. However, given the paucity of attendance on the Opposition Benches, I am not sure whether we shall have an equally robust and lively debate today. The hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale) and I seem to be in almost permanent session in Committee.<br><br>
The purpose of the broad economic guidelines and the excessive deficits procedure is to help ensure that member states' economic policies are consistent with the goals of the treaty. Those include non-inflationary economic growth respecting the environment, a high level of employment and social protection, and raising the standard of living and quality fo life. The objectives of the treaty are entirely consistent with those of the Government.<br><br>
Section 5 of the European Communities (Amendment) Act 1993, usually known as the Maastricht Act, requires Parliament to approve the Government report sent to the Commission for the pruposes of multilateral surveillance. The Government's strategy for economic policy is set out in the Economic and Fiscal Strategy Report and the Financial Statement and Budget Report, brought together in the Government report "Budget 99", and it is our intention to base any information sent to the Commission on the material in the "Budget 99" document.<br><br>
"Budget 99" set out the Government's strategy for achieving high and stable levels of growth and employment. The 1999 budget will help build a stronger economic future for Britain through reforms that will put work, enterprise and families first. By
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
protecting the environment and ensuring that growth is sustainable, the 1999 Budget will also ensure a better quality of life today and for future generations.<br><br>
Of course, I cannot possibly let any description of the Government's economic policy pass without stressing that it is designed to put an end to the years of boom and bust, from which Britain has so grievously suffered.<br><br>
The key elements of the Government's strategy are, first, to lock in economic stability as a platform for long-term sustainable growth; secondly, to raise productivity through promoting enterprise and investment; thirdly, to increase employment opportunity with a better deal for working families that makes work pay; and finally, to build a fairer society, with a better deal for families and children. In order to deliver economic stability, low inflation and sound public finances, we have introduced an open and transparent monetary framework that is already beginning to deliver low and stable inflation. We have introduced a transparent fiscal framework set out in the code for fiscal stability, with two strict fiscal rules to deliver sound public finances; and a new public expenditure regime with new three-year spending plans to provide greater certainty, better use of public resources and more effective long-term planning.<br><br>
The 1999 Budget continues to lock in the structural improvement of public finances. This Government inherited an appalling level of public deficit. Under the last Government, net borrowing rose to over £50 billion. Since coming into office, this Government have brought public finances back under control. That has allowed interest rates to peak at a much lower level—indeed, at half the level that we saw in the previous economic cycle—and subsequently to fall more quickly to the lowest long-term interest rates for 40 years.<br><br>
We remain on track to meet our tough fiscal rules over the economic cycle, while guaranteeing to invest an additional £40 billion in health and education over the next three years. We also announced extra resources for schools, hospitals and safer communities in the Budget. I am not sure whether the official Opposition still regards that additional spending as reckless, whether they have changed their mind, or whether they are as divided on that issue as on almost everything else. Perhaps we will find out later this afternoon.<br><br>
Net borrowing in the last financial year was £1 billion, and we ran a current budget surplus of just over £4 billion in the past year, in contrast to the deficit in all but three of the past 25 years. As a result, net borrowing in the 1999 Budget is projected to remain low, and total projected net borrowing over the next five years is lower than in any single year in the previous Parliament. Current budget surpluses totalling £34 billion are expected over the next five years, compared with the staggering deficit over the previous economic cycle of £149 billion. Public sector net debt has fallen from 44.3 per cent. of GDP in 1996–97 to an estimated 40.6 per cent. of GDP in 1998–99. It is projected to fall to less than 40 per cent.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0158">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
of GDP next year, and to less than 35 per cent. of GDP by 2003–04. I hope that all Committee Members will welcome that.<br><br>
Our prudent approach to the management of public finances means that we can combine a falling debt ratio with rising public sector investment. Public sector net investment is set to double to 1 per cent. of GDP by 2001–02. That will begin to address the years of neglect in public sector infrastructure, especially in our hospitals and schools.<br><br>
Our reforms in monetary and fiscal policy will help us to steer a course for stability. The global downturn will inevitably impact on growth this year. Lower growth this year is mainly due to weaker growth in UK export markets. The Budget forecast is for GDP growth of 1 per cent. to 1.5 per cent. this year.<br><br>
The economy is therefore well placed for stronger growth into 2000. The combination of timely policy loosening—under our new arrangements for the Bank of England—the underlying financial strength of the private sector, increased Government investment and an easing in trade conditions is expected to underpin stronger growth, back towards trend rates, into 2000. The Budget forecast is in line with the latest assessments of a number of leading organisations, including the Bank of England, the European Commission and the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. Independent forecasts have also appeard firmer in recent months, and a clear consensus exists that the economy is well placed for stronger growth into 2000, in striking contrast to the predictions of gloom and doom, and the talking down of the British economy, that we heard from the official Opposition only a few months ago.<br><br>
By building on a platform of stability, the Budget creates the opportunities for business to succeed and the incentives to increase productivity. It cuts taxes on small businesses for the second year running, with a new 10p rate of tax, and a new small business service will offer a way through red tape and regulation. The Budget also supports innovation and encourages businesses to create incentives for their managers, owners and employees. Increasing productivity and closing the productivity gap with our main competitors, which we inherited, will help to raise living standards in the economy as a whole.<br><br>
We also need to do much more to create a fairer society, by making work pay, giving families a better deal and protecting the environment. Further steps were taken in the Budget to make work pay. Moving people from welfare to work is a key priority. The new deal will help people who for years have been detached from the labour market, including the young, the long-term unemployed, lone parents, disabled people and the partners of the unemployed.<br><br>
In the Budget, we introduced the lowest rate of income tax for more than 35 years. The basic rate, at 22p in the pound, is the lowest for 70 years. The reforms that we have made to national insurance contributions remove nearly 1 million low-paid people from national insurance, while protecting their benefit entitlement which will boost their rewards from work and spread the burden of contributions more fairly.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
The new 10p rate combined with the working families tax credit increases mean a minimum income guarantee of £200 per week for a family with a full-time earner. No working family with earnings of less than £235 a week—some £12,000 a year—will pay net income tax from October 1999. I know how welcome that proposal will be to my constituents and to people throughout the country.<br><br>
We are determined to make work pay. That is the best way to reduce this country's utterly unacceptable levels of poverty, especially among children. We have also said that we will consider extending the principle of the working families tax credit to those without children, to help them to move from welfare to work.<br><br>
The Budget introduced several measures that will help to build a fairer society, in particular by delivering a fairer tax system for families with children and a minimum income, as I said, for a family with a member who is in full-time work. The new children's tax credit and increases in child benefit will deliver the lowest tax burden since 1972 for families with children. The Budget, and last year's Budget, mean that families with children will be on average £740 a year better off. Seven million families stand to gain, and 700,000 children will be lifted out of poverty.<br><br>
The Budget also included the most radical and far-reaching package of environmental tax reforms that this country has ever seen. That package includes measures to help to tackle climate change by reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, to improve local air quality—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oliver Heald <span class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Hertfordshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister knows, I do not often make contributions. When she said that the average family will be better off, was she taking account of all of the stealth taxes, including those on fuel, cigarettes and alcohol, which are being increased? Has council tax been taken into account? Has she simply given us a fiddled figure?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is always a pleasure to hear from the Conservative Whip—he spoke yesterday in the Finance Bill Committee. I referred, of course, to the take-home pay that a family with a full-time worker will receive. In his reference to the tobacco tax, the hon. Gentleman ventured on to dangerous territory. The Opposition health team supported the increase in tobacco duty on health grounds, but the Opposition Treasury team has apparently decided to oppose it. There seems to have been no consultation. The hon. Gentleman may prefer to reconsider his decision to discuss that tax.<br><br>
In the Budget, we have also introduced measures to limit the environmental impact of land use, through the landfill tax escalator, and of water pollution. In particular, we introduced measures that will deal with the environmental problems that are associated with transport and which support the Government's integrated transport policy. We have introduced a major reform to the company car tax regime, which will benefit the environment by removing the incentive
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0159">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
to drive additional miles and by giving drivers the incentive to choose more fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly cars.<br><br>
We are building a stronger economic future for Britain. The Budget gives a better deal for the people of Britain. It will help us meet our goals of high and stable levels of growth and employment and a fairer society for all. The Budget contains the right economic policies for Britain, and it is in line with the objectives of the European Union.<br><br>
Approving the motion will enable the United Kingdom to meet our treaty obligations, to provide information and to participate fully in the important process of multilateral surveillance and economic cooperation, which are provided for in articles 103 and 104c of the treaty. I hope that the Committee will support the motion.</span></p>
<p>4.44 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Whittingdale <span class='memberconstituency'>(Maldon and East Chelmsford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the debate is, as the Minister said, to fulfil our obligations under the Maastricht Act to report to the Commission on the overall management of the British economy. Ministers justified that in previous debates by explaining that we allow independent examination of our performance by a numbr of international bodies and that it allows us to share best practice. I have no quarrel with that. However, there is more than a suspicion that our wish to demonstrate our obedience to the broad economic guidelines that are set by the European Commission has more to do with the Government's hidden agenda to prepare the ground for British entry into the euro.<br><br>
Before I address that, I want to express a small amount of sympathy for the Commission in the task that is ahead of it to extract meaningful information from the propaganda that passes for the Government's Financial Statement and Budget Report. The truth is that the Government have done everything in their power to conceal and distort the facts about what has really happened to the British economy in the two years since the general election.<br><br>
The Red Book fails to provide some of the most basic information. It does not set out the overall effect of all the taxes that are contained in the Budget. Instead, it includes a host of public expenditure measures that are redefined to give the impression that taxes are rising by less than is the case. The Red Book also fails to set out the level of Government borrowing over the coming years. Instead, the public sector borrowing requirement, with which for generations we have become familiar as the accepted measure of Government borrowing, is no longer calculated. The Red Book also fails to calculate the effects of the Budget changes to direct and indirect taxation on ordinary families, a question that has always been answered by Conservative Governments.<br><br>
The Commission and the taxpayer are entitled to have that information, but it is not contained in the documents before us. There is no doubt that the Government have raised the art of media
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
manipulation to a new level. They are one of the most dishonest Governments in history. Anything that does not fit the Prime Minister's and the Chancellor's version of the truth is airbrushed out of documents. Harmful facts are ignored, damaging statistics are omitted or discontinued and the truth is turned on its head. The Government inherited a golden economic legacy—[<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. No sedentary interventions, please.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Whittingdale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful, Mr. Malins.<br><br>
The Government inherited the longest period of low inflation for 50 years, faster growth and lower unemployment than any other major European economy, and the lion's share of investment into the European Union coming to this country. The Labour party put a great deal of effort into convincing people that that inheritance would be safe in its hands. Instead, we are seeing step-by-step squandering of all the hard work that made the British economy in the 1980s and 1990s one of the most competitive and flexible in the world.<br><br>
First, in breach of the undertaking given at the last election, the Government have increased taxes by stealth in ways that they hoped would not be noticed. The first two Budgets of this Parliament increased taxes hugely and, despite what the Chancellor said in his speech, the latest Budget has done nothing to reverse that. Every headline-grabbing cut in the rate of income tax that was announced by the Chancellor was qualified in the small print. Other stealth tax increases were hidden away in the accompanying documents which cancelled them out. We have seen Miras abolished; the married couple's allowance—one of the last recognitions of marriage in the tax system—scrapped; petrol and diesel tax increased for the third time in two years, so that prices of both are now easily the highest in Europe; stamp duty up again; and the top rate risen by 250 per cent. since the government took office. That is a measure that hits businesses rather than primarily home owners. Business taxes were raised by £3.2 billion in this Budget alone.<br><br>
All in all, it was one of the most dishonest Budgets in history. Even the Labour-dominated Treasury Select Committee was forced to conclude that the tax burden would increase during the coming year. The Chairman of that Committee, the hon. Member for North Durham (Mr. Radice), said, in the understatement of the year, that the Red Book was not as clear as it might be and took some reading. Simply on the basis of the measures already announced, the Government intend to raise taxes during this Parliament by an extra £40.7 billion, the equivalent of £1,500 for every taxpayer. Yet we look in vain for any mention of that in the documents before us.<br><br>
The share of national income taken by the state is also rising—from 35.4 per cent. of GDP in 1996–97 to 37.6 per cent. in 2001–02. The Conservative legacy, and all the competitive advantage that it represents to this country, is being thrown away.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0160">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
Secondly, the Government have launched a vicious attack on savings by abolishing TESSAs and PEPs, and imposing a £5 billion a year tax on pension funds. According to the Government's own figures, the savings ratio is set to fall just 7.5 per cent. this year. Two years ago when the Government took office it was over 10 per cent., so savings are already down by a quarter. ISAs, which are more complicated, less attractive and more costly, have already proved a spectacular f10p. We were told when they were first announced that they would create 6 million new savers. Instead, many existing savers who invested regularly in PEPs are rejecting the new ISAs; and the supermarkets who we were told would offer ISAs at the checkout, have decided not to bother.<br><br>
At the same time the pensions tax will take some £5 billion out of the funds that will be needed to provide for the retirement of millions of working people. One estimate is that it will cost each person trying to do the right thing and put away something for their retirement an extra £272 a year simply to maintain the same level of benefits when they come to retire, while the effect on non-taxpayers, who will no longer be able to reclaim tax on their dividends, is to deprive 300,000 pensioners of an average of over £100 a year.<br><br>
All those tax increases are directly in breach of the Labour party's commitment at the last election that it had no plans to raise taxes. The reason for the increases is the Government's failure to meet another pledge—that they would control welfare spending. Figures from the Library—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barry Sheerman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Huddersfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Laurel and Hardy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am getting the bit between my teeth. Does my hon. Friend agree that we are seeing a sustained attack on each aspect of the property-owning democracy—on savings, on home ownership, through the abolition of MIRAS, the limiting of discounts on the right to buy, high interest rates, and massive increases in council tax, and then on pensions, one of the largest assets that people have through the changes that my hon. Friend mentioned? Surely it is an example of new Labour being a new form of socialism and trying to destroy everything that the Conservatives created.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Every one of the measures that he outlined will increase taxes for ordinary people, despite everything that they were told at the time of the last election. He, as a former Social Security Minister, will know well that the Government have failed to meet their pledge to control welfare spending.<br><br>
Figures from the Library show that social security spending in real terms will increase by £38.2 billion over the next three years, almost as much as the increases in health and education, to which the Minister referred, combined.<br><br>
Not just individuals are being forced to pay the price for the Government's failure. Businesses have been hit by higher taxes and more red tape. The Government's
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
Budget documents talk incessantly about the need to improve competitiveness and to close the productivity gap with Europe and the USA. The Minister repeated that point this afternoon, but the Government's actions have simply loaded huge additional costs and burdens on to business.<br><br>
British chambers of commerce calculate that the total increase in tax on business over the course of this Parliament will be £30 billion. On top of that, there is another £15 billion of extra costs and regulations through measures such as the working time directive, the social chapter and the national minimum wage. There is still more to come—with new laws to grant trade unions compulsory recognition. Every one of the Government's measures is making it more expensive to do business in this country.<br><br>
It is hardly surprising that the president of the CBI has talked about the "creeping paralysis" of British business through red tape and regulation. It is no wonder that the head of employment at the Engineering Employers Federation has warned that
<br><blockquote><p>"managers are going to spend more and more time on the Working Time Directive distracting them from managing their businesses",</p></blockquote>
or that the chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses has complained that
<br><blockquote><p>"small firms are now being over-regulated to such a degree that it is too costly and too risky to employ staff."</p></blockquote>
The Chancellor of the Exchequer likes to talk about stability and an end to boom and bust. Such remarks have been parroted again this afternoon. However, the economy has ground to a halt. The latest output figures show that gross domestic product has risen by just 0.1 per cent. in each of the last two quarters. Manufacturing industry is in recession, with output down for three quarters in a row. The latest retail sales figures, which have come out in the past week, show total spending falling by 4.6 per cent. in the 12 months to April—the steepest drop for more than five years.<br><br>
Total unemployment has risen for two months in a row. In the north-east and Merseyside, unemployment is higher now that it was at the time of the last election and the figures in the Red Book show that unemployment is forecast to go on rising. Instead of making things better, the Government's policies are ensuring that the downturn is steeper and longer lasting than it ever needed to be.<br><br>
There is also a hidden agenda, which I have already mentioned. Despite all the economic arguments and the views of the overwhelming majority of British public opinion, the Government are determined that we should join a single currency and scrap the pound. They are prepared to sweep aside the constitutional objections. They refuse to veto damaging measures, such as the withholding tax, in case they are thought to be bad Europeans. They are trying to create the impression of inevitability by spending millions of pounds on a national changeover plan before the British people have even had their say in a referendum.<br><br>
The Government's position is not if, but when. However, they also conceal the truth about what that means for monetary policy and for the management of our economy. Experts including Gavyn Davies of

Goldman Sachs, the European Commission, the Trades Union Congress, David Smith of <i>The Sunday Times</i> and Hans Tietmayer of the German Bundesbank are all clear that Britain will be required to shadow the euro—or to rejoin the exchange rate mechanism mark two—for two years prior to entry into a single currency. Yet when the Prime Minister was asked whether the pound would shadow the euro before the next election, he simply said no. That is simply not good enough.<br><br>
Page 61 of the European central bank's annual report, which was published a couple of weeks ago, states:
<br><blockquote><p>"observance of the normal fluctuation margins provided for by the exchange rate mechanism"</p></blockquote>
is one of the four criteria for British entry into the single currency. That same point is repeated a few pages later. Will the Minister now tell us whether the monetary policy committee is to be given the object of shadowing the euro in order to meet that condition for entry?<br><br>
Finally, an announcement was sneaked out last Friday, under the cover of the local election results, that we are to sell 400 tonnes—more than half—of our gold reserves and to buy euros instead. The effect of that announcement was to cause an immediate drop in the price of gold. Will the Minister tell us whether that was the intention of the announcement? If so, why on earth was it made in advance? Why are we investing in euros, which have dropped by over 9 per cent. in value in four months? Many people believe that the answer is that it is part of the Government's overall policy to take this country into the euro by stealth.<br><br>
Lord Lawson said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I think this gold sale is being done in preparation for joining the euro … The Belgians and the Dutch did exactly the same thing when they were preparing to join EMU. You don't really need gold reserves if individual central banks cease to exist in all but name when you join EMU."</p></blockquote>
Robert Pringle, of the world gold council, said:
<br><blockquote><p>"This action undermines Britain's negotiating position with the EU. It will make it much harder for Britain to refuse to join the euro. In effect, the results of the referendum are being pre-empted by the government. It only makes sense as part of the preparation for abolishing the pound. The irony is that it won't win the Chancellor any friends in Europe either—by knocking $8 off the price, Gordon Brown has at a stroke reduced the value of the Euro area's gold reserve by more than £3 billion!"</p></blockquote>
The debate is about the Government sharing information on the state of the British economy with the rest of the European Union. Yet on so many issues—from taxation to EMU—the Government have refused to be straight with the British people about what they are doing and what they propose to do in future. By all means let us send these documents to Brussels, but let us not pretend that they show the truth about the Government's economic policies.</span></p>
<p>5.2 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Vincent Cable <span class='memberconstituency'>(Twickenham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford, I pondered initially over the purpose of the debate. I wondered whether it was simply a reporting exercise or part of a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
serious discussion on economic convergence. Initially, I treated it as a bit of old-fashioned political knockabout and was unsure whether it was necessary. I see the colours on the television screen, so our debate is not being recorded for the world outside.<br><br>
Towards the end of the hon. Gentleman's statement, however, he raised an important new issue—gold sales—that introduces new controversy into the ancient arguments about EMU. That is worth responding to, but the official Opposition allowed their fantasies to run away with them.<br><br>
Of all the countries that announced planned gold sales, by far the largest sale was made by Switzerland, which by no stretch of the imagination could be viewed as a candidate member for monetary union: it is not a member of the European Union or even of the European economic area. The sales were a purely commercial transaction designed to diversify reserves into assets that produce a yield. Gold, of course, produces no yield whatever.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford is a well informed member of the debating community on financial matters, so he will know that among the central banks currently announcing their intention to diversify into euros are the Banks of China and Taiwan—neither of which have any conceivable aspirations to join EMU. We all anticipated that the euro would become an internationally traded currency and that the major central banks would want to acquire it as part of their portfolio. That is customary central banking practice and has nothing to do with the British Government's intentions.<br><br>
Let me refer to the direct purpose of the debate. There is clearly a minimalist reason—that the Government have to send a letter and some documents to Brussels. However, I agree with the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford that the debate is really about convergence.<br><br>
As the Economic Secretary said in her remarks—I apologise for missing her introduction—we have already achieved substantial economic convergence in two respects. The first is institutional. We now have an independent central bank despite all the misgivings expressed at the time. The official Opposition were especially voluble when it was created, but it has turned out to be distinctive model and an outstanding British success. As a result of the independence of the Bank of England, the Monetary Policy Committee has become far more radical in its use of the economic rate to stimulate the economy than a politicised Chancellor could ever have been.<br><br>
Most people in the financial community would regard the independence of the Bank of England as a success. That independentce was initially motivated by the feeling that Britain needed to converge in how it managed money, as against the rest of Europe.<br><br>
As the Economic Secretary mentioned, convergence has occurred in relation to debt ratios, deficit reduction and inflation. However, serious problems may arise in two areas in which convergence has not occurred. The Economic Secretary knows my views on that matter, as she replied to an Adjournment debate that I secured a couple of weeks ago.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0162">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
A serious problem may arise in relation to the exchange rate. Since I secured my Adjournment debate, the Director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research—a more distinguished economist than me—has analysed the problem and concluded that the British pound is now approximately 15 per cent. overvalued in relation to its underlying competitive value.<br><br>
That presents a problem in relation to European convergence. The Government are still ambiguous about monetary union. However, if they intend to move towards union, the rate at which we enter will be a growing problem. Now that the European central bank has shown a certain willingness to act and cut interests rates, the problem is compounded. Interest rate differentials are widening; the normal economic argument would be that the British pound would appreciate further if they widen again.<br><br>
That creates a potentially serious problem. At what rates are we to converge with the rest of Europe if monetary union is to be achieved? My solution, which has been taken up by others, is that the Government must undertake an exercise to establish publicly the range of exchange rates—not necessarily the precise point—that would be economically acceptable. They could do that themselves or commission independent agents to do it.<br><br>
It would be wrong of the Government to hope that the exchange gets to the right rate as if by magic. That simply will not happen.<br><br>
The Economic Secretary clearly will not concede that point, as it relates to a major issue which concerns the highest realms of Government. However, I have a minor suggestion for the Government as to how they could help. They could publish data that would help those studying the problem to get a better grip of what is happening.<br><br>
I apologise for the technical jargon that I am about to use. There is no reason why the Government should not publish key concepts, such as the real effect of the exchange rate, which is how the exchange rate moves to take account of inflation differentials in various countries and different exchange rate movements, and is the standard measure of whether a country is becoming competitive.<br><br>
At the moment we have to dig through the House of Commons Library for such information or go to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. It should be part of the standard basket of economic statistics. Equally, publishing estimates of purchasing parity would enable us to compare our price level with that of other European countries. At the moment, we can compare inflation, but not price levels.<br><br>
That is the raw material of an informed economic discussion about what form convergence with Europe should take. At the moment, we are groping around without adequate data. The Government could, at the very least, be creative in that field.<br><br>
Finally, I will address an area where convergence is not happening but should be. The exchange rate is key, as is how the Bank of England operates. I am sure that the Economic Secretary has read the minutes of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
most recent meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee. Those minutes show that, for the first time, a serious concern has arisen about the exchange rate and obligations which go beyond cutting inflation.<br><br>
That raises the possibility that interest rates may have to be cut as a result of the appreciation of sterling. The Bank of England lacks anything in its mandate that enables it to consider convergence with EMU. That is not something that the Bank is allowed to look at. It has a very narrow mandate but in time it will have to acquire a most ambitious range of tasks. I know that the Economic Secretary will not answer today, but it must continue to be repeated that the Chancellor of the Exchequer will shortly have to send the Bank of England a more ambitious letter widening its range of responsibilities if it is serious about entering into economic and monetary union.</span></p>
<p>5.10 pm.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The debate has been brief but rather interesting. I should like to respond to a couple of points.<br><br>
The first relates to the gold sales announced last Friday. I am extremely grateful to the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable), the spokesman for the constructive Opposition, for dealing so effectively with the comments of the spokesman for the official Opposition, the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford. It saved me the trouble of responding in great detail.<br><br>
I must stress that Friday's announcement about gold sales has nothing whatever to do with our possible entry into a single currency. It is simply a matter of sensible rebalancing of the reserves in line with decisions taken by many other Governments and central banks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it true that 40 per cent. of the proceeds will be used to purchase euros?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Under the current arrangement for our currency reserves, some 40 per cent. are indeed held in euros. We shall consider where to place the proceeds of the gold sales in terms of currency reserves, which are held in dollars, euros and yen. We keep the proportions under review, and that will continue. It has nothing to do with possible entry into a single currency.<br><br>
There have been some curious comments, not least from the noble Lord Lawson, about not announcing the sales in advance. I assume that we should have played the market in some underhand fashion. That would not be consistent with our principles of transparency and orderly market conduct. Indeed, most serious market players have welcomed the announcement and the fact that we have made our intentions transparent and not sought to behave in an underhand and manipulative way.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0163">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Economic Secretary therefore suggesting that if the Bank of England were to intervene in the currency market it should announce its intention in advance in the interests of transparency?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a substantial gold market. The status of gold in relation to reserves has changed substantially in the past few decades. When we decide to sell a significant amount—nonetheless, only some 3 per cent. of our total reserves—into the gold market, it makes sense to announce in advance that we are doing so, as we do with gilt sales. We made the announcement and made clear our intentions. The first auction will take place in accordance with the announcement.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Twickenham made some interesting comments about convergence and the exchange rate. I will not, as he anticipated, answer him in detail; we discussed this in the debate that he initiated some weeks ago. What I will do is consider the matter of the publication of data to see whether the Government wish to take it forward.<br><br>
On the point made by the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford, I will not take lectures on statistics and transparency from a member of the party that for years fiddled the unemployment figures, making it impossible to tell what was actually happening to unemployment and participation in the labour market. As a result of this and our previous Budgets, the tax rate for a family with two children will be reduced to its lowest level for 25 years.<br><br>
My right hon. and hon. Friends are proud of that achievement and we expected congratulations on it from a party that used to boast of its commitment to cutting taxes although, as we know, it introduced 22 tax rises.<br><br>
This year's tax burden will be lower than last year's and in the coming two years it will be lower than it was last year, whereas under the previous Government's plans it would have been higher this year than last, higher next year than last, and higher the year after than last year. The Conservative party increased taxes. The Labour party is cutting taxes and managing finances prudently, therefore delivering £40 billion of additional investment to schools and hospitals</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Lady. I rather think that I am getting the hang of this.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sheerman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No you are not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman needs to hone his act before I take lessons from him. The Economic Secretary makes great claims for expenditure on the national health service and so on. But is it not true that since the general election there has been a huge rise in the number of people on waiting lists? Among the hospitals in East and North Hertfordshire which serve my constituents and those of the hon. Member for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
Welwyn Hatfield (Miss Johnson), the number of people on waiting lists has increased from 11,700 to 13,500 since the Government was elected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have permitted a very wide-ranging debate, and the hon. Gentleman knows that hospital waiting lists are not in order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Hewitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Mr. Malins. I am quite overwhelmed by the Conservative Whip's participation in the debate, but I shall resist the temptation to follow him down the path of hospital waiting lists, much as I would have enjoyed it.<br><br>
I come back to the submission of information in documents to the European Commission. The Government have set out in the documents our economic plans and strategy and detailed the way in which they will help achieve proper management of the economy and stable high employment and growth.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford mentioned broad economic guidelines and economic convergence. Let me stress that the Government have contributed significantly to the broad economic guidelines for this year. They are much better documents than last year's—as was generally agreed at ECOFIN on Monday. The documents make it clear that member states of the European Union are committed to economic reform and reform of labour, product and capital markets—issues that we put on the EU's agenda during our highly successful presidency.<br><br>
I am happy that we are sharing that information with our European partners, thus helping to shape Europe at this critical time in a way that brings the benefits of higher employment and growth to Britain and to other member states. I urge the Committee to support the motion.</span></p>
