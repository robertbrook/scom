PENSION SHARING ORDERS: ENGLAND AND WALES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Amendment proposed [this day]:</i> No. 77, in page 70, line 50, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(2D) No pension sharing order shall be made which is materially contrary to the interests of any child of the family, or any other child of either of the parties.'.—[<i>Mr. Quentin Davies</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this it will be convenient to consider the following amendments: No. 182, in schedule 4, page 72, line 36, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(c) after the words "for the benefit of the other party" there is added "or a child of the family'".</p></blockquote>
No. 183, in schedule 4, page 73, leave out line 17 and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(2) In subsection (1)—
<ol>
<li>for "scheme" is substituted "arrangement"</li>
<li>after the words "to the other party" is added "or to a child of the family"'.</li></ol></p></blockquote>
No. 184, in schedule 4, page 73, leave out lines 18 to 24 and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(3) In subsection (2)—
<ol>
<li>in paragraph (a)</li>
<ol>
<li>from the words from "trustees" to "have" there is substituted "person responsible for the pension arrangement in question has",</li>
<li>for "them" there is substituted "him", and</li>
<li>after the words "to the other party" there is added "or to a child of the family", and</li></ol>
<li>in paragraph (b) after the words "to nominate the other party" there is added "or a child of the family", and</li>
<li>in paragraph (c)</li>
<ol>
<li>for the words "trustees or managers of the pension scheme" there is substituted "person responsible for the pension arrangement", and</li>
<li>after the words "for the benefit of the other party" there is added "or a child of the family".'.</li></ol></ol></p></blockquote>
Before I call the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies), it may assist the Committee to know that there may be quite a number of Divisions in the House tonight. If they are single Divisions, I intend to suspend the Committee for 15 minutes; if they are doubles, I shall suspend for 30 minutes.<br><br>
Secondly, I remind the Committee that I intend to break for dinner between 7 and 8.30 pm. Thirdly, the Committee Room is warm, and gentlemen may
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 412</span>
therefore remove their jackets. To those who have already removed them, I am tempted to say, "Put them back on!"</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies <span class='memberconstituency'>(Grantham and Stamford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. McWilliam. The little drama that we all enjoyed just before we broke for lunch was both salutary and productive. I have many failings, but giving up easily is not among my more obvious ones. That may be partially thanks to you, Mr. McWilliam, because I have had to fight for my life under your vigorous chairmanship on several Select Committees. Like animals whose chances of biological survival are enhanced if they are raised in a harsh environment, perhaps it is in that harsh environment that I have learned not to give up readily.<br><br>
It is obviously a good thing that I did not give up too readily, because we put forward these amendments, the first of which—amendment No. 77—contains the principle that the interests of children should be an overriding factor. The second, third and fourth amendments provide for earmarking possibilities for children. The Government initially came back with what I described as "footling" responses of the order of, "Your Government didn't do it when your lot were in, did you?"</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Hugh Bayley)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The reason why the Conservative Government did not "do it" when they were in power is not because of any lapse or fault on their part, but simply because they did not need to do so. The Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 already provided the protection for children that the hon. Gentleman seeks, and that the Government also seek. It is not necessary to "do it" to protect children.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary has moved us on to his substantive objection, which is that it is not necessary. When I expressed scepticism about this earlier, the Minister read out the relevant passage of the new version of section 25 of the 1973 Act, which apparently provided protection for children. I pointed out that it provided protection only for children who were deemed by the court to be children of the family. When I moved amendment No. 77, I explained at length that the object of the operation was to treat all children as being of primary importance in any distribution of assets, particularly an irrevocable distribution such as a pension split—be they children of the family, or of either party to the marriage being dissolved, or children born subsequent to the marriage but whose interests might be negatively impacted by a pension split. That is why we feel that such major protection is required.<br><br>
When I pointed out to the Minister—correctly, as it turned out, although I encountered some resistance—that section 25, as redrafted, was inadequate in that respect because it dealt only with children "of the family", I was then told that there were other protections mysteriously in the system, and the Minister undertook to reveal them. That took a little while—no doubt his officials were scurrying around trying to come up with an answer. The Minister came up with the absolutely preposterous idea that sufficient
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0697">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 413</span>
protections are available for children in section 25(1)(b) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, which refers in general terms to
<br><blockquote><p>"the financial needs, obligations and responsibilities which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future".</p></blockquote>
That involves financial responsibilities and financial commitments of any kind. Moreover, children cannot be adequately described as being financial responsibilities—they are human beings, and the associated responsibilities are very great. Paragraph (b) involves various financial responsibilities. I point out, with no frivolity, that it could refer to building societies; perhaps it should also include what you owe to the local pub.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The fact that the local pub is owned by my wife's cousin does not mean that I owe it anything.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You understand what I mean, Mr. McWilliam.<br><br>
The Government's proposal is a shamefully inappropriate way to deal with children. If a counsel wanted to argue in court that children's interests are pre-eminent in paragraph (b), he or she would have to persuade the court that that is what Parliament really meant. What paragraph (b) really means might be contained in the amendment, which would make the interests of children pre-eminent. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"No pension sharing order shall be made which is materially contrary to the interests of any child of the family, or any other child of either of the parties."</p></blockquote>
It would be ludicrous to tell the courts that paragraph (b), which refers purely to financial obligations and liabilities, is equivalent to saying that a child's interests are pre-eminent, which the amendment clearly does.<br><br>
If we have ever won a point in our debates, we have won this one. The Government have been running all over the place desperately trying to find an excuse not to accept the amendment. How extraordinary. I began by denouncing the Government for not having thought of the interests of children, and they replied, "We did not think about those interests because it was not necessary to do so. Children are already provided for." They then referred us to paragraph (b), as if that were equivalent to the explicit defence of children's interests which we want to include in the corpus of legislation.<br><br>
This is a more striking victory than that which we scored rather memorably on Thursday, when we argued that it would be wrong to split a pension that had already been split. The Government said of our proposal, "No, that would be unreasonable. It would create inequity between first, second and subsequent spouses." However, we were told later in that debate that the Government accepted the principle that if a pension was reduced by earmarking, it should not be subject to subsequent splits. They accepted that principle and the possibility of discrimination between first, second and third spouses. The Government's
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 414</span>
arguments in that regard were fundamentally bogus, and the same is true of their responses to the amendment.<br><br>
Frankly, the Government are hiding behind a paper curtain in their attempts to resist the amendment. If they really share our view of children, I cannot think why they are determined to resist the amendment. The fact that they will not agree to it may be an example of new Labour machismo. They do not want to accept any amendment that is not proposed by the Labour party. They are deeply ashamed and embarrassed—as they should be—that they did not consider enshrining protection for children in the Bill. It was more than a slip; it was a fundamental and disgraceful error. They should be ashamed. I am not unduly surprised that they have not apologised for the oversight or said that they will do something about it. They are trained by new Labour public relations spin doctors—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eric Pickles <span class='memberconstituency'>(Brentwood and Ongar)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Alastair Campbell.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend and Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) mentions the magic name of Alastair Campbell, who is responsible for the debilitating culture that is creeping into our political life. It encourages people who make mistakes to argue the toss and find any goddamn argument why they should not be doing what they know to be right. That is not good enough. The only way to make progress is to put the amendment to a vote. If it is not carried, I hope that the arguments will be weighed more objectively in another place and will not be subject to the same PR and whipping pressures. We need to improve the Bill because the issue of children is vital.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 182, 183 and 184 are more technical. They would provide an earmarking facility in favour of children. The Government again gave the excuse that the amendments are not necessary. They said that it is not always appropriate to have earmarking orders in favour of children, but that is not an argument. If it is sometimes appropriate, we ought to provide for it. If there is a reason to deprive the courts of that weapon, let us deprive them of it, but the argument has not been made. If the thrust of the Bill is to give the courts a greater range of weapons, that argument applies a fortiori to enable courts to earmark pensions for the benefit of children.<br><br>
The Government also suggested that no one wanted the earmarking provision. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) for passing me a letter from Mr. Nicholas Mostyn QC to the Clerk of the Social Security Committee. Although Mr. Mostyn offered to draft the three amendments for me—an offer that I rapidly accepted—I did not know about his communication with the Social Security Committee on this matter. I knew about his evidence, but not about the letter because I am not a member of that Committee.<br><br>
The letter displaces the Government's argument that no one wanted an earmarking provision. Mr. Mostyn wrote:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0698">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 415</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"When representing a wife I negotiated a settlement whereby the wife and the children of the family"—</p></blockquote>
that is important—
<br><blockquote><p>"secured a proportion of the husband's death-in-service benefit. My opponent and I were then surprised to discover that there is no power in ss 25C and D"—</p></blockquote>
the sections that we are discussing—
<br><blockquote><p>"of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 to make ear-marking orders in favour of children! This is absurd."</p></blockquote>
We have documentary evidence from a practising counsel that he achieved with his opponent—the counsel for the other party in the divorce—an arrangement that was in the interests of both parties and their children, but which could not be implemented because they discovered a lacuna or flaw in the 1973 Act. No Committee could want more decisive evidence that it should do something about the legislation that it is considering. The need is established and the solution is available in the form of the three amendments. It is only bloody mindedness and not-invented-here syndrome that prevents the new Labour Government from accepting them. That is not good enough.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Julian Brazier <span class='memberconstituency'>(Canterbury)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to set one matter straight. The Under-Secretary is an honourable man who would not deliberately mislead the Committee. He rightly referred to references to conduct in the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. The Family Law Bill was changed because the courts had eliminated the need for it through case law, hence my parallel comments with regard to this measure. My hon. Friend referred to a lacuna in the statutes. Across a range of areas, points that appear to be common ground—politically—between the two parties are not covered. The reality—or practice—is not what Ministers would like the Committee to believe. That is why my hon. Friend is right to press his amendment.</span></p>
<p>4.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, may I assure the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford that we have noticed that he does not give up easily. He does not even give up when his amendment is shown to be unnecessary. That is at the core of the Government's argument.<br><br>
The Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 has been on the statute book for 26 years. If there were an example in case law or any law report where the judge felt unable to fulfil his duty, under that Act, to give first consideration to the welfare of children because of a flaw in the drafting of the Act, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would cite it. I have asked my officiasls whether they are aware of any such case in the 26-year period, and they are not. The policy basis for the amendment is laudable—the hon. Gentleman and I agree that the first duty of a court on the dissolution of a marriage must be to protect the welfare of the children, but the existing law is sufficient to do that. We are not aware of any cases where it has failed to do that.<br><br>
The legal phrase, "child of the family" applies more widely than the natural children of a couple whose marriage is being dissolved. It includes all the children who have been accepted into that family. If I may refer
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 416</span>
the hon. Gentleman to the example that he gave this morning—that of a parent whose spouse died shortly after the birth of children and who remarried and divorced—those children, in law, are children of the second family, and their interests would be paramount under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, which would be used to determine the financial terms of the dissolution of the second marriage.<br><br>
There is no merit in creating unnecessary complication by interfering with law that has been on the statute book for a quarter of a century. That law has worked well in terms of its fundamental aim, which is to secure the welfare of children. On that basis, I urge the Committee to reject the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gainsborough)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask the Under-Secretary a simple question, which relates to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury Mr. Brazier about conduct. We sought to include amendments in the Family Law Act 1996 to give the courts the power—the exact nature of which I cannot remember—to take conduct into account. My hon. Friend reminds me that that power has been used only twice by the courts under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before that.<br><br>
Under the latest divorce laws, the courts can take conduct into account in relation to distribution of assets and access to children. Does the Under Secretary agree that the courts should take conduct into account when splitting pensions?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Good. That is a good answer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary has made a couple of points that I must take up. It is not good enough to allow the fate of children to depend on whether counsels can successfully argue that they are children of the family for the purposes of the 1973 Act. There is a risk that some natural children of the parties concerned will—indubitably—not be children of the family for the purposes of the definition. The purpose of the amendment is to protect all children involved and to ensure that their interests are paramount. The Under-Secretary's first proposal does not satisfy the requirement to protect all children. He also argued that all children are adequately covered by section 25(1)(b) of the 1973 Act, which refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"the financial needs, obligations and responsibilities which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future".</p></blockquote>
That is quite absurd. Counsel should be able to argue not merely that children are covered but that they are pre-eminent. However, the 1973 Act does not state that children are pre-eminent. If Parliament intends that children are pre-eminent, it should say so. Where the legislation refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"the financial needs, obligations and responsibilities which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future",</p></blockquote>
it should add that any natural child of either of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0699">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 417</span>
parties shall be deemed to be the most important of those obligations. That would clarify a matter that, as it stands, is unclear. It will not do for Parliament to leave the matter open in this fashion.<br><br>
The Committee is going round in circles and I shall be happy to put the amendment to a vote as soon as possible. I am afraid to say that the Under-Secretary's arguments are becoming less and less convincing. If he really wants to solve the problem, he should do so in the manner that we have proposed.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary described me as persistent. You will recall the events before lunch, Mr. McWilliam, when I was effectively told not to trouble my little head because the Bill contains various protections. There was tittering among Labour Members who thought that, for once, I had been caught out. When my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury talked about postponing the matter on Report, perhaps he was trying to throw me a lifeline. If so, that was sweet of him. [HON. MEMBERS: "Ah."] However, the Bill contains no such protections and I was therefore right to be persistent.<br><br>
So far, the Minister of State has not emerged from our proceedings with glory—[<i>Interruption.</i>] At least, he has not done so in terms of winning the arguments. He may have thought, "This is great—this is the moment when our fate is turning." However, it was not to be because I had no intention of throwing in the sponge at that point.<br><br>
That was not the first time that we have discovered, through persistence, flaws in the Government's arguments. I cited the example of last Thursday's debate on protections against subsequent splitting of pensions. Through persistence, we discovered a complete inconsistency in the Government's position. Pensions that will be subject to an earmarking order will be protected against further reduction, but others will be able to be reduced by a split. There is no conceivable rhyme or reason for that discrimination, the very existence of which illustrates the hollowness of the Government's arguments.<br><br>
A precisely comparable circumstance has arisen this afternoon. If we cannot win the argument here, we must take the matter further, because children are extremely important. The unambiguity and clarity of our laws are also extremely important. It is about time that we legislated to say what we mean and mean what we say, which would be the precise effect of the amendment.</span></p>

I remind the Committee that we are discussing appeals and nothing else.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that we are discussing appeals. Amendment No. 165 was tabled because it is not clear what the Government have in mind. I refer the Committee to line 23 on page 71 of schedule 3. New subsection (4D) is to be inserted in section 31 of the 1973 Act and, rather curiously, states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The variation of a pension sharing order prevents the order taking effect before the end of such period after the making of the variation as may be prescribed by rules made by the Lord Chancellor."</p></blockquote>
What is that variation of a pension-sharing order? If it prevents the order from taking effect, presumably the order can never take effect if it is being varied. How can it be varied? I assume that the only legitimate way to vary it is by appeal. I tabled the amendment in the interests of clear legislation. It would insert "following an appeal" between the words "order" and "prevents". The provision would then state:
<br><blockquote><p>"The variation of a pension sharing order following an appeal".</p></blockquote>
If that is the circumstance in which an order may be varied, I understand the purpose of the provision and it is reasonable. If there is another way in which an order can be varied, we should be told about it so that we can debate it. If there is no other circumstance in which an order can be varied, we have everything to gain and nothing to lose by making it clear that it refers to an appeal.<br><br>
Amendment No. 166 refers to paragraph 9 of schedule 3 on page 72. Paragraph 9 is one of those annoying provisions that must be read more than once even to be able to hypothesise on the Government's intention. It is an example of shoddy drafting. I suppose that the Minister did not draft it himself, so perhaps he will pass my comments to the parliamentary draftsman who did so. I know that you are a stickler for the English language, Mr. McWilliam, so you may agree, even if you feel inhibited from expressing a substantive point of view—</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have no view on the Bill. My duty is to order progress and discipline and to ensure that hon. Members behave themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Those are honourable and necessary tasks, Mr. McWilliam. However, I know that you are a stickler for the English language and people north of the border are often more accurate in their use of it than people south of the border. That may be connected with the system of education that you have up there, but we shall discuss the provisions applying to Scotland in due course.<br><br>
New section 40A(2) of the 1973 Act states:
<br><blockquote><p>"If the pension sharing order relates to a person's rights under a pension arrangement, the appeal court may not set aside or vary the order if the person responsible for the pension arrangement has acted to his detriment in reliance on the taking effect of the order."</p></blockquote>
There are at least two problems with that drafting. One is that "person" is used in a two different senses in one paragraph, which is not sensible or helpful. The person whose rights are being shared is clearly not the person who is responsible for the pension arrangement because that is the trustee or manager who must take action and implement the court order that splits the pension. The person whose rights are being shared is the member of the scheme. The second problem is that in the phrase "to his detriment" the word "his" is used ambiguously and could apply to either person. The drafting is extremely muddled.<br><br>
A muddle of substance, which is worse than a muddle of form, arises new section 40A(4), which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"where subsection (2) or (3) above applies, the appeal court may make such further orders (including one or more pension sharing orders) as it thinks fit, for the purpose of putting the parties in the position it considers appropriate."</p></blockquote>
At first sight, that seems absolutely crazy. It implies that if an appeal is turned down, there could be a counter order by the Court of Appeal. It seems most peculiar to me, but that court is being given completely arbitrary powers. I dislike the ambiguity created by this part of the Bill and believe that it should be simplified, as I have attempted to do, so that what is intended will be absolutely clear to anyone involved, particularly to anyone who is contemplating an application for a pension split. That is why we tabled an amendment to leave out the whole section and replace it with something simpler.<br><br>
5 pm<br><br>
The amendment states:
<br><blockquote><p>"40A No pension sharing order shall take effect until after the time allowed for appeal has expired."</p></blockquote>
If we include such a provision, we can do away with all the complications about varying a pension order and pension orders not taking effect until they have been varied. We just need to ensure that no one implements a pension order until after the time for appeal has expired or after an appeal has been determined. Then there will be no ambiguity and no need to vary a pension order in the light of a subsequent appeal. The amendment is in the interests of simplification and of avoiding unnecessary cost—I keep returning so that with no apology, Mr. McWilliam, because it is clear
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 420</span>
that the Government have seriously underestimated the costs of this exercise and so many of the provisions add incrementally to potential costs. Above all, the amendment is in the interests of justice, which cannot be served by such an arbitrary power as the one described in new section 40A(4), which provides that:
<br><blockquote><p>"the appeal court may make such further orders…as it thinks fit, for the purpose of putting the parties in the position it considers appropriate."</p></blockquote>
That power is unnecessary. What is important is that the court should determine the appeal. Then the pension-splitting order will be implemented, as amended, if it has been amended on appeal. If there is no appeal, it will not have been implemented until the time for appeal has expired. Therefore, no ambiguity will arise. I commend the amendment to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security (Mr. Stephen Timms)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford because I had some difficulty understanding the purpose of the amendment, but he has now made it clear.<br><br>
The Bill provides for a stay period, delaying the implementation of a pension-sharing order until the opportunity to bring the majority of appeals has passed, to avoid the danger of a pension being shared and then having to be unpicked. Amendment No. 165 would provide that a stay period should apply to a pension-sharing order that has been varied on appeal, but not if it has been varied other than on appeal.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman said that he could not think of any circumstances, other than on appeal, in which an order could be varied. However, there are ways in which it is possible to change an order other than on appeal and I shall explain what they are in a moment. In those other cases, the pension-sharing order, as varied, would take effect immediately as long as the divorce order had been granted. That would remove the opportunity for the member spouse or former spouse to challenge the terms of the variation, or for the pension arrangement to flag up any potential difficulties. I am sure that we can take if for granted from what the hon. Gentleman said that that was not the intention behind his amendment.<br><br>
Everything hangs on the circumstances in which a variation can be made, other than on appeal. Variation and discharge are covered by sections 31, 31A and 31B of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. We all know what an appeal is: It is a challenge to an outcome: in this instance, to the principle that a pension-sharing order should be made at all. However, it is possible for an application to be made to vary an order that does not involve a challenge to the principle of the order. That is, it does not question whether it was right for a pension-sharing order to be made, but rather seeks to change the terms of the order.<br><br>
Another distinction is that, usually, an application for appeal is made to a higher court, whereas an application for a variation is made to the court that issued the original order. Therefore, a procedure is well-established in legislation for variations other than by appeal. We believe—and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would accept—that it is appropriate for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0701">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 421</span>
there to be a stay period in the case of variations of that sort, as well as when the variation is the consequence of an appeal.<br><br>
Amendment No. 166 would replace the provisions in schedule 3, paragraph 9, which deal with appeals out of time, with a provision that deals with appeals in time. The mechanism for appeals in time is already covered by new section 24F together with the establishment of a stay period, so the amendment effectively repeats what is already in the Bill. If we were to remove the proposed new section 40A, set out in paragraph 9, as amendment No. 166 would do, the Bill would contain no provisions restricting or guiding the actions of the court when faced with a successful appeal out of time, which can arise on a pension-sharing order. That could have dangerous and expensive consequences both for the couple and for the pension arrangement. For example, the court could instruct the pension arrangement to recreate the member spouse's original pension fund, which could be technically impossible. Therefore, new section 40A limits the court's freedom to act in that one area, while still giving it the power to put the couple in the appropriate position following a successful appeal out of time.<br><br>
I entirely agree with what the hon. Gentleman says about the complexity of the clauses that deal with this issue but I hope that, given those explanations, he will feel able to withdraw the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is getting bogged down in unnecessary complexity and semantics. In response to amendment No. 165, he said that there were other circumstances, apart from an appeal, in which a pension-sharing order could be varied, so I pricked up my ears to hear what the other circumstances were. He said that they were circumstances in which one of the parties were disputing not the principle, but the terms of a pension-splitting order. I suspect that most appeals are about the terms of an order. For example, an appeal might be based on the argument, "It is not fair. The court has given 60 per cent. of my pension to my former wife. She should have only 30 per cent." Of course, an appeal would have to justify such a demand by reference to some precedent or consideration that was not taken into account by the court that made the initial decision. However, it is just as much an appeal, whether it relates to the terms of an order or to whether a pension split should have taken place. Indeed, under this legislation, the court will not have much liberty to decide whether a pension split should take place because I am afraid that the whole drift of the Bill is towards a situation in which the courts will start with a pension split before considering anything else.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has missed the point. There is a difference between variations and appeals, which is set out in legislation. The law regarding variation is established in the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. The Bill deals with variations as well as appeals, but the hon. Gentleman's amendment would remove the reference to variations.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 422</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I repeat that that is a purely semantic distinction. The Minister will say that the measure is already enshrined in legislation, but that is the fundamental difference between us, and something that seems to emerge in relation to many clauses. We believe that this is an opportunity to introduce better, simpler, clearer legislation, but the Minister says that provisions already exist—there might be some complexity, or a muddle, but that is all right and we can carry on using the existing law. It reminds me of people who used to defend rotten boroughs in the 18th century: "Let us carry on with what we have and make it even worse if necessary, but do not take the opportunity, in our brief human lives, to try to improve anything."<br><br>
The Minister and I have a fundamentally different approach to legislation. I suspect that that is not so much grounded in any fundamental party-political principle, but in the fact that the Minister has been completely taken over by his civil servants and his departmental machine and does not dare try to extricate himself from the bog into which he is being drawn.<br><br>
As for the Minister's response to amendment No. 66, he said that new section 40A restricts the powers of the court in some circumstances. I believe that it gives arbitrary powers to the courts. It may be impossible for a court to order a pension scheme to recreate a split pension if that is impractical, but it is—apparently—possible for the Court of Appeal to make further orders as it thinks fit for the purpose of putting the parties in a position that it considers appropriate. That is entirely arbitrary. Parliament is giving the court a blank cheque.<br><br>
Frankly, our appetite for improving the drafting and technical efficiency of the Bill—we are rapidly losing any sympathy for its main purpose—is subject to some erosion and I am not inclined to put the amendment to a vote. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

ORDERS IN SCOTLAND</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is when we reach Scotland. The clause amends the Family Law (Scotland) Act 1985 to allow Scottish courts to make pension-sharing orders. As in England and Wales, the amendments will enable the whole, or a proportion of the value of the parties' current pension benefits, to be transferred from one spouse to the other as part of the overall financial settlement. I should like to make a number of points, on the provisions for pension sharing in Scotland.<br><br>
First, we are placing pension sharing within the framework of existing Scottish matrimonial law, which puts emphasis on the fair division of matrimonial property. The net value of matrimonial property, including pension benefits, is divided on divorce. Except in exceptional circumstances, the presumption is that the net value of matrimonial property should be shared equally between the parties. The pension-sharing order will provide the Scottish courts with an additional means of ensuring that matrimonial property is shared fairly between the parties.<br><br>
Secondly, I should mention a small point of difference between the provisions for Scotland and for England and Wales. Subsection (3)(b), in the definition of "pension sharing order", provides for the percentage value or the amount of the shareable rights to be transferred. Allowing the transfer of an amount reflects substantive law and current practice in Scotland in relation to orders for financial provision on divorce. If an amount is specified in an order or agreement, the amount of the debit created under clause 21 will be that specified amount or, if less, the current cash equivalent of the members's rights.<br><br>
Finally, much of what I have described will apply equally to pension sharing by negotiated agreement, for which provision is made in clause 20. There is a very honourable history in Scotland for settling financial arrangements in advance of divorce by negotiated agreement. More than 85 per cent. of cases are taken forward in that way. We want to encourage the settlement of arrangements by agreement where that is possible, because it helps to reduce acrimony and promotes post-divorce arrangements that will last.<br><br>
The provisions for Scotland are designed to ensure that pension sharing will be consistent with Scottish matrimonial law. At the same time, we have tried to keep any differences between the provisions in Scotland, compared with those in England and Wales, to a minimum.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 424</span>
<p>5.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This interesting clause gives us an opportunity to discuss the Scottish system. The Minister said that there is a presumption in Scotland that matrimonial property should be divided fairly, which in practice usually means equally. I tried to persuade my colleagues on the Select Committee that England should move to the Scottish system and that the Bill should be the vehicle to do that. I was not successful in persuading my colleagues, partly because the Lord Chancellor's ancillary relief advisory group—which was asked whether the Bill, or a similar Bill, should be used to move to the Scottish system—advised that it was not an appropriate vehicle.<br><br>
I am sure that the Minister will say that the Bill is not an appropriate vehicle, but whether or not it is, this is an important debate. The Scottish system is fair and it is easily understood. The only way to convince increasing numbers of people who divorce that divorce is not worth while and that they should fight to maintain their marriage, whatever their difficulties, is to make it clear that all assets that have been accumulated during a marriage will be divided up. As my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar said, these cases involve the judgment of Solomon without the happy ending. The Scottish system provides a useful service in that context.<br><br>
We shall probably move to the Scottish system. In question 17 of the Select Committee report the Minister of State, Department of Health said:
<br><blockquote><p>"What I do recognise is that potentially family law can evolve over time in England and Wales and in Scotland and it will be necessary for pension sharing provisions to evolve with those changes of family law."</p></blockquote>
When the Bill is enacted, to what extent will the two systems move together? I hope that they will move together and that they will not be totally separate.<br><br>
In response to question 110, Lord Justice Thorpe said that he thought that much evidence suggested that the Scottish system worked well enough. However, to be fair to him, he also summed up well the alternative view. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"unfairness in individual cases is the price that you pay for stated principles."</p></blockquote>
One of the problems with English divorce law is that too few stated principles are understood by the general public. Too many people go into the divorce courts not knowing what the final result will be. However, there are no doubts under the Scottish legal system.<br><br>
Mr. Martin Pointer made an interesting statement in response to question 256 on page 58 of the Select Committee report. His response is an interesting example of how little co-ordination there is between the Scottish and the English systems. He described an interesting case in which he was involved. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"there was a marriage where the husband and wife had been together for something over 60 years. They were obviously both very old. I was acting for the wife. I said in argument to the judge, 'Could we please have 50 per cent.?' The judge said, 'You don't need 50 per cent., because she can be nicely housed for £X and a handsome income can be provided for her with capital of £Y.' I said, 'The husband doesn't need 50 per cent., because he's older than my client is, so his need is actually less. In Scotland, if my client were getting divorced in Scotland, she'd get half, so if that's
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0703">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 425</span>
fair in Scotland why isn't it fair in England?' The judge said, 'Well I'm not concerned with what happens in Scotland.'"</p></blockquote>
Given that England and Scotland are closely intertwined, that attitude is unfortunate. Admittedly, their laws are separate, but in many respects, as two friendly nations in the same political union, they march arm in arm and should continue to do so.<br><br>
Families Need Fathers made a similar point. Paragraph 10 of the Select Committee report, on page 113, states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Government should explain why it proposes two different treatments—what precisely it has in mind in both jurisdictions—and publish an anaylsis of the different impacts. It would be useful for the Government to publish some information on the workings of the present two systems and the likely effects of grafting on pensions sharing. There should then be further consultation, before legislation is introduced, on the approach to be adopted. Though England and Scotland have different legal systems and traditions, that does not seem sufficient reason to adopt different approaches."</p></blockquote>
The point is reiterated in answer to No. 573, with which I shall not deal because the point has been clearly made.<br><br>
It is not entirely clear why the Government will not use the Bill as a vehicle to bring the two systems together—</span></p>

<p><i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>
<p>5.36 pm</p>
<p><i>On resuming</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As it happens, I was about to finish my speech, and I shall not use the adjournment as an excuse to repeat the same point, which I think I have already made adequately.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Jacqui Lait <span class='memberconstituency'>(Beckenham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I put my Scottish hat on for a moment—unfortunately, I cannot put on a strong Scottish accent. It is interesting that the Bill contains proposals to amend Scottish law, which, according to my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh), seems perfectly adequate to Scottish lawyers. Although I am a lawyer, my impression is that Scottish law has dealt with all these issues quite adequately until now.<br><br>
At a time when the Government are about to bring into being the Scottish Parliament, which will have the power to make its own laws for a separate and distinct Scottish legal system, it is interesting that the British Parliament should decide to amend Scottish law in an area that, historically, they have not hitherto amended. You may remember, Mr. McWilliam, during your days in Edinburgh politics in the 1970s, when I, too, was active there, albeit on a different side, how we all worked together to amend the Scottish divorce laws. One of the leading players in all that was the then hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central—now the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, the right hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook). We all worked together to make Scottish divorce law more humane.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 426</span>
Having achieved that, over the years we have built up, in Scotland, an adequate system of divorce law that also deals with pensions and the division of assets. If I were standing for the Scottish Parliament—which I have no intention of doing, as I would have to acquire an even thicker Scottish accent to do so—I would feel upset that the British Parliament should try to impose on Scotland a system of pension splitting, with which the Scottish people may not be happy, at a time when it is about to take legislative responsibility for itself—whether one agrees with that or not. I suggest that this should be a responsibility for the Scottish Parliament, and should not be included in the Bill. It might, if I understood my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough correctly, be supernumerary to requirements in Scotland.<br><br>
One of my reasons for having pride in Scotland is that our Scottish law is usually infinitely better than English law. England usually adopts our laws eventually, although it sometimes takes a long time for the penny to drop. There is adequate legislation in Scotland, a Scottish Parliament that may or may not wish to have this legislation foisted on it, and according to my relatively adequate contacts in Scotland—an active group of people who want to reform the law as it affects families, women, divorce and pensions. It therefore seems, at the very least, patronising for the Government to try to impose on Scotland their views on how pension splitting should work. That is why I do not want the clause to be included in the Bill.<br><br>
I would be interested to hear the Minister's justification for its inclusion. The matter could be devolved to Scotland, and those who stand for the Scottish Parliament may wish to take up the issue in their election campaigns and party manifestos. It may slide through easily and quickly—there is little need for pension splitting in Scottish law, so it will probably be uncontentious—rather than dividing the Scottish Parliament and taking up an enormous amount of time.<br><br>
Will the Minister tell me how he justifies the British Parliament's imposition of the measure on Scotland and—if I correctly understood what my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough said—the need for such a measure in Scotland? The measure should not be part of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister and my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) have pointed out, the Scots have a different system of law. That has been the case since before the Act of Union. It is based on the Roman or civil tradition. If I recall correctly, Scotland was one of the first countries in the 17th century—when Roman law underwent a revival—to codify its law in the classic Roman tradition and on the model of Justinian's codex. A Scandinavian country—Denmark or Sweden, as I recall—and Scotland were the first to produce a modern codification. If my memory serves me correctly, the famous institutions of Lord Stair predated the codification in Prussia by 30 or 40 years and that in France—the famous code Napoleon—by
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0704">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 427</span>
nearly 150 years. Not only have the Scots had a proud tradition of civil law, but they have been the leaders in a respectable school of legal traditions.<br><br>
We, the Irish and other Commonwealth or former British empire countries—including, most notably, the United States of America—have a different system of common law. That is extremely important in divorce law, not only because the codification is different but because the principle of equity is differently interpreted in Scotland. It is interpreted in much the same way as it is interpreted in a French or other continental court. It is different from the tradition in common law—the meaning of the term differs between our two countries.<br><br>
When contemplating a new piece of legislation, it is no bad thing to consider whether lessons can be learned from one tradition or the other. I was interested to hear from my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough that he had tried to argue with his colleagues on the Social Security Committee not for the imposition on Scotland of the English solution and approach to pension splitting, but for the reverse—the adoption of the Scottish principle here. The most valuable aspect of such Committees is often the private conversations that do not appear in the published minutes and we had an insight this afternoon into the interesting discussions that took place in the Select Committee. My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough raised some interesting issues there.<br><br>
The Scottish principle is to distinguish between matrimonial and non-matrimonial assets. By definition, non-matrimonial assets are not split on divorce. If they were earned or, in the case of pension funds, accrued before marriage, they have nothing to do with the marriage.<br><br>
5.45 pm<br><br>
To say that a non-working spouse should have the right to share in assets because he or she may have contributed by enabling the working spouse to earn more money or to acquire more in the way of pension rights than would otherwise have been the case cannot apply, by definition, to a period when the two parties were not married. There is natural fairness in the concept of matrimonial and non-matrimonial assets, and simplicity in that distinction. I have argued, and will continue to argue during our proceedings, for the principle of both justice and simplicity. Those virtues have been forgotten by Ministers, whose minds are so befuddled by PR considerations that they can think of little else. The argument advanced by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough was pertinent and should be taken further.<br><br>
I contemplated tabling amendments on that principle, but it would have been a dramatic strategic decision to try to introduce into our law concepts that are part of a different tradition. That course should not be entered into lightly or rapidly without considerable consultation with the legal profession, the academic world and people with experience of the system in Scotland. I did not table such amendments and the Opposition retain an open mind on the matter. We all listened with interest to comments on this subject from our Back-Bench Members.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 428</span>
I have had some discussions with members of the Lord Chancellor's advisory group on ancillary relief. Members of that group visited Scotland and those that I met said that they knew nothing about the Scottish system before going there. It seems extraordinary that members of the legal profession in London have absolutely no idea of what is happening 300 miles away in any direction, but apparently that is so.<br><br>
The people I spoke to were eager to defend the separateness of the English system. I am the last person—you know me too well, Mr. McWilliam, to suppose otherwise—to dream of suspecting that the professional judgment of such people could be anything other than disinterested or that lawyers would be reluctant to adopt a legal system that might curtail the prospect of litigation. I am not suggesting for a moment that such a consideration could ever have darkened the mind or infected the conscience of any learned members of the legal profession. I have the greatest respect for their professionalism and disinterestedness, and every other quality that they manifest to the great glory of society and the nation. I merely suggest that those discussions were insufficiently profound and thorough completely to exhaust the question of whether lessons might be learned from the Scottish system. It would be right to consider that from time to time.<br><br>
I shall share an interesting and striking argument with the Committee on which hon. Members on both sides might want to ruminate. Someone with a great sense of scandal in his voice put it to me that, if we used the Scottish system here to determine the division of assets on divorce, it would provide that the assets to be split—which would count as matrimonial assets—would include the portion of the pension that was accrued during the term of the marriage, and that Princess Diana would not have qualified for a material divorce settlement. My answer to that was, "Nor, of course, would the Duchess of York have qualified." It so happens that Princess Diana is—rightly—a popular and admired figure. The Duchess of York does not have such good PR—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is fascinating, but I do not understand how those two individuals would have qualified for a divorce under Scottish law. They might have qualified—the Princess Royal certainly did—but as neither applied for one, the hon. Gentleman's point is not material to the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is material. As you suggested, Mr. McWilliam, the choice of venue might be material to the settlement. If we are to legislate for the United Kingdom, it is important to be absolutely clear about the extent to which the choice of venue for a divorce—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The amendment does not deal with the choice of venue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not addressing an amendment; I am talking about the clause, which governs the legal regime in Scotland. It is important in that context to decide, first, whether the clause should establish a separate regime for Scotland and, secondly, whether
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0705">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 429</span>
it might be expanded to embrace England. My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough made that point in his useful contribution.<br><br>
We need to reflect on the inherent justice in the clause. That is why I mentioned Princess Diana's divorce, which was an emotional case. It would have been a great injustice had she not obtained a substantial divorce settlement. But we must consider whether it is right for people to receive substantial divorce settlements if they have not brought financial assets to the marriage or if the spouse's pension assets were largely accumulated outside the marriage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. This clause does not deal with other assets; it deals only with the pension.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely, Mr. McWilliam, but pension assets are typically a substantial part of household assets in this country. Whatever regime is used to split those assets will also apply to pensions. We had better decide whether that regime is fair, workable and clear and has the virtues that we believe should be enshrined in the clauses. The discussion on whether we should expand the clause to include England should not be closed. I clearly heard what my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough said. I am sure that there will be opportunities to consider that further in the House.<br><br>
I have a series of questions on how the clause will work in practice in Scotland. If the courts are expected to use the same principle to divide existing matrimonial assets, which they have experience of splitting, and pension assets, they will need an effective and unambiguous method of deciding which portion of pension assets is, in the Scottish definition, matrimonial and which is not. The courts will therefore have available to them calculations of the cash equivalent transfer value of the pension when the marriage comes to an end and when the marriage was contracted. The first calculation is fairly simple but, given that the marriage may have been contracted some years previously, the second calculation may be less simple. Logically, the portion of the pension that represents matrimonial assets will be the first calculation minus the second. Therefore, it is important to have clear figures for both values.<br><br>
In the case of a money purchase scheme, it may be fairly easy—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is returning to an earlier debate. If he reads the clause carefully, he will see that it has the same effect as the earlier clause. It deals merely with the definition of a pension-sharing order in Scotland, where pension-sharing orders are the order the day.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Mr. McWilliam, but if Scottish courts are to interpret the clause and to decide on "shareable" rights and how they should be shared, they must have the means to value those rights.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 430</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman has misunderstood me. The clause does not deal with that matter. It is dealt with in existing legislation and has already been interpreted by the Scottish courts. The clause merely brings the terms into line and does not affect existing legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My concern is that we will grant the courts a power that they could use in practice. It is clear that, because—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman continues to misunderstand me. The clause will not impart any power to the Scottish courts that they do not already have; it will merely change the interpretation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Under this interpretation, the Scottish courts' task will be to split pension rights. They will have to decide which portion of the total pension value is matrimonial and which is not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. May I make myself plain to the hon. Gentleman? He is out of order because he persists in arguing that the clause will give additional rights to the Scottish courts to determine the proportion of pension value that will be taken into account. It will not. Those rights already exist in Scottish legislation. The clause simply brings into line the nomenclature used in that legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Very well, Mr. McWilliam. I shall try to remove any doubt about the relevance of my remarks by being a little more precise. Subsection (3)(b) states that a pension-sharing order is an order that
<br><blockquote><p>"specifies the percentage value or the amount to be transferred".</p></blockquote>
As you know better than anyone, Mr. McWilliam, the amount to be transferred in Scotland can be a share—typically, 50 per cent.—of the portion of the pension that represents a matrimonial asset. That portion can only be the difference between two sums: the cash equivalent transfer value of the pension when the marriage ended and the value when it commenced. In my view, in the case of a money purchase scheme, there should be no undue difficulty in calculating those amounts. It is perfectly possible to assess the market value of pension assets accumulated in the past and the actuarial calculation of the resulting cash equivalent transfer value. That calculation may be much more problematic—perhaps even technically impossible—with occupational pension schemes, because it will be retrospective—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I understand the mistake that the hon. Gentleman is making. Had the clause dealt with pension-sharing rights, which we previously debated at length—we discussed whether it should be front-ended or back-ended—I would have grouped it with the clause that I mentioned earlier. However, It does not deal with pension-sharing rights. It refers to Scottish legislation which the hon. Gentleman has discussed and which does not need to be elaborated on. He is getting into trouble because he is trying to remake an argument that is not relevant to the clause.</span></p>

<p>6 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I give you an unqualified assurance, Mr. McWilliam, that I am not trying to re-make any argument, and that it would be illogical for me to do so. By definition, my point can relate only to Scotland. It would be irrelevant for an English court to decide what were matrimonial and non-matrimonial assets, because those concepts do not exist in English law. The quandry to which I referred arises only in relation to Scotland. Will it be possible for the courts accurately to assess the current cash equivalent transfer value? You rightly said, Mr. McWilliam, that English courts have to make that assessment in relation to a pension split in a divorce case. Equally, does that assessment need to be made in relation to the date on which the marriage began? That will allow the matrimonial portion of the pension asset to be divided equitably.<br><br>
I hope that I formulated my question farily clearly, and to your satisfaction, Mr. McWilliam. I also hope, albeit rather more vaguely, that we shall get a clear answer from the Government.<br><br>
I want to comment on the general issue that my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham raised. She asked a fundamental question about the clause. Why was it included in the Bill? The situation is extraordinary. The new Labour Government introduced a Scottish Parliament, which we believe is problematic for several reasons, although we shall work with that Parliament in a democratic spirit. We shall do so as best, and as constructively, as we can, although we should not have conceived of such an interference with the United Kingdom's constitution.<br><br>
Having done that, the Government said, "The Scottish Parliament cannot decide what the Scottish law should be on divorce," although that matter is specific to Scotland. Other responsibilities that have been given to the Scottish Parliament are not totally specific to Scotland—the transport, health and education systems relate in some way to the system that exists in the United Kingdom, and they will be financed on the same basis. One might think that Scottish law, which has nothing to do with English law, could be debated in the Scottish Parliament. However, the Government, who introduced the proposals for a Scottish Parliament, will not allow the Scottish Parliament to discuss Scottish law, which is specific to Scotland.<br><br>
To add insult to injury, there are no ministerial representatives from the Scottish Office on the Committee. The Minister's constituency is East Ham, which is even further from Scotland than are Grantham and Stamford or York. I notice that the Under-Secretary, who represents the City of York, has not discussed the clause. Scottish law is now apparently in the hands of the Minister, who has received no help from any Scottish colleague—unless the hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mrs. McKenna) is about to contribute to our debate. Perhaps she will make an impressive and definitive pronouncement on the future of Scottish law. The whole matter is being handled by an English Member of Parliament, and there has been absolutely no participation on behalf of Scotland, which is an insult
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 432</span>
to the Scottish people. It throws current developments into unmistakable relief. Clearly, Scottish devolution is simply a squalid political ploy invented by the Labour party—[<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I cannot see how this arises from clause 16. I also suggest that hon. Gentleman should be careful, as he is treading on very dangerous ground.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I may well be treading on dangerous ground, if you mean politically dangerous ground, Mr. McWilliam. All my colleagues and I are equally shocked by the cynicism and levity with which the Government are treating the Scottish people in this matter. If you ask me what the relevance is, it is this: what the devil is this clause doing in the Bill? Why is it not being debated by the Scottish Parliament? What is the point of having a so-called Scottish Parliament that is not allowed to be a legislature, because it is not allowed to make laws?<br><br>
Instead, the matter is being debated here, and the Government think that they can get away with so much, because of their great majority—not only south of the border but north of the border—that they have not even gone for the fig-leaf of providing a Scottish Minister to take part in these debates and to advise us, or a Scottish lawyer to help us with our deliberations. Here we are, behaving as though we were legislating for some remote and incompetent colony, thousands of miles away, and doing the best that we can.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is being unfair. The hon. Member for Cumbernauld is here, and I have no doubt that she will shortly share with the Committee her views on Scottish law and what is going on in Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I shall withdraw at least some of those strictures. If the hon. Member for Cumbernauld is in fact the secret Scottish law officer sitting in Committee, and is about to reveal her true colours and her true role in life, then as long as her intervention is sufficiently persuasive and authoritative, I will say, "Yes, fine, we have a Scottish legislator here, taking part in Scottish legislation." However, if that is not the case, what we have is a farce, a charade at the expense of the Scottish people. The Scottish people will not forget this, and when it comes to the elections to the Scottish Parliament, this matter may well be raised in the campaign—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Rosemary McKenna <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cumbernauld and Kilsyth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course, I am delighted to give way to the hon. Lady, but I hope that she will be able to catch your eye, Mr. McWilliam, and give a full speech of her own, and not have to satisfy herself with merely intervening on me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. McKenna</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman apologise to the people of Kilsyth, as my constituency is Cumbernauld and Kilsyth?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is that the extent of the authentic representation in Committee of the interests of Scotland?<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0707">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 433</span>
Of course I apologise to the hon. Lady for not remembering the full title of her constituency. Indeed, the Minister of State, who deals with me in many different contexts—he probably wishes that he did not, but he has to—occasionally gets my constituency wrong, so I think that it may be considered a human error. It was not intended to be a slight on the hon. Lady—for whom I have the greatest regard, although, sadly, I have not got to know her well yet, largely because she does not play much of a part in the Committee's deliberations—or a slight on her constituency or on Scotland.<br><br>
Scotland is a country for which I have the greatest affection, but I do not pretend to have the honour to be Scots, as is my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham; nor do I pretend to be a Scottish lawyer, or an expert in constitutional matters. I am extremely uncomfortable in this Committee where we have a new Labour Government using their enormous majority to ride roughshod over the interests of the Scottish people and the proper consideration that ought to be given to Scottish law in a matter of this importance. It is disgraceful, and reflects the fact that the whole idea of Scottish devolution is a fundamental fraud on the Scots people.<br><br>
It is a squalid political ploy, designed to buy off some Scottish national feeling, while ensuring that there is an overwhelming Labour majority here, for the time being, that can be used to outvote English Members on matters of importance south of the border. That ploy will not earn the respect of people either north or south of the border. The way that the Government are treating Scotland on this matter is something that they will live to repent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The clause is extremely narrow, and provides for the percentage value of the amount of shareable rights to be transferred, which reflects the position in Scottish law. That is all, so if the hon. Gentleman wants to continue to debate the subject, I hope that he will restrict his comments to whether that is a good idea.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Oh, Mr. McWilliam, I should have thought that after all your years of experience you would recognise a peroration when you heard one. That was the end of my speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I recognise a peroration, but I prefer it to be in order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened with interest to the hon. Member for Gainsborough, who made the more illuminating contribution to our debate. I hesitate to express a view on which of the two systems operating in the United Kingdom is preferable, but I take his point about the attractions of the Scottish system, which the Select Committee considered. It undoubtedly has merit, but the paragraph before the one he referred to alludes to the review carried out by the Lord Chancellor's ancillary relief advisory group, to which the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford also referred. The Lord Chancellor is a Scot
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 434</span>
and he asked the group to consider whether it might be beneficial to adopt the Scottish system. It was unanimous in its view that we should not adopt that system, at least not without a lot of preliminary work. However, no one disputes that there are benefits in the system.<br><br>
The point of substance for the Committee, which the hon. Member for Gainsborough raised, is whether the Bill will lead to encouragement or discouragement for the two systems to move together. I do not believe that the Bill will make a difference either way. It will provide a further degree of flexibility, but it will have no bearing on whether the split of assets is more or less likely to be a 50:50 split, which is most common under the Scottish arrangements. The Bill will have no effect on that. I understand that the hon. Gentleman would like it to, but I do not believe that it will.<br><br>
We have discussed devolution, but pension law and pension sharing are not devolved. Family law is devolved, which is why there is a separate clause to cover the position in Scotland.<br><br>
I do not know whether the hon. Members for Grantham and Stamford and for Beckenham believe that pension law should be devolved. I have no recollection of them saying that during our debates in the House on devolution. I believe that they were opposed to devolution, but today they are saying that it is scandalous that this element of the Bill is not being devolved. They have had a rapid change of view.<br><br>
During the general election campaign the Labour party's manifesto to the people of Scotland contained a commitment to pension sharing. The Scottish people supported the Labour party overwhelmingly at the general election and I remind Conservative Members that no member of their party was elected in Scotland. Their party was comprehensively and utterly rejected by the people of Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. McKenna</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may be interested to know that last weekend the leader of the Conservative party in Scotland, Mr. David McLetchie, suggested to Conservative voters in Scotland that they may use their second vote to support the new Labour party.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that information. I suspect that not many voters will use their first vote in support of the Conservative party. The Conservative party was absolutely, utterly and comprehensively rejected at the general election. The Government are keeping their manifesto promises and introducing pension sharing in Scotland, England and Wales, in accordance with the promise that we made.<br><br>
I shall make a couple of other points about the Scottish system because we have touched on whether Scottish family law arrangements should be adopted in England. Today, the Law Society issued a press notice saying that, in its view, it would be unfair for a 50:50 split to be introduced. I must tell the hon. Member for Gainsborough that there is no support for the formula approach in England and Wales, although it is generally accepted that it works well in Scotland.<br><br>

6.15 pm<br><br>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford made a point about the matrimonial value of the pension. My understanding is that the usual presumption—as he said—is that the net value of the matrimonial property should be shared equally between the parties, but that matrimonial property comprises all property belonging to the parties at the relevant date. That includes pension benefits. The relevant date is the earlier of the date of separation or the date of service of the divorce summons, so there is no need to calculate the subtraction that the hon. Gentleman suggested was necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not pretend to be an expert in the Scottish system, but I understand that matrimonial assets are those assets that are accumulated during the marriage. Under Roman law and under civil law anywhere, on divorce, the parties keep the assets with which they arrived at the marriage and merely split the assets accumulated during the marriage. Therefore, it is necessary to distinguish bewteen that part of the pension that accrued during the marriage and that part that accrued before it. I simply want to ask the Minister whether a reliable formula is available to ensure that that calculation can be made justly and unambiguously in practice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that matrimonial property is all property belonging to the parties at the relevant date. I gladly undertake to check that in more detail outside the Committee, but that is my understanding of the situation. If the arrangement is as the hon. Gentleman describes, all sorts of difficulties could arise—not only in the context of pension sharing—because the same sort of calculation would need to be done more widely.<br><br>
As so often in this Committee, the difficulties foreseen by Opposition Members are not related to pension sharing. The Bill merely provides additional flexibility to ensure that courts are able to achieve a fair split of assets on divorce.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister had better write to me about that because he has just revealed his fundamental ignorance of Scottish law. That underlines the point I made earlier: that it is horrific that English Ministers should be making decisions, and indeed defending them, on the basis of fundamental ignorance of how the system works. I am trying to look up evidence, which I am sure I can find given a few minutes, which will show that I am right. I am certain that the Scots system of divorce is based on the splitting of assets accumulated during marriage, which is regarded as the common property of both parties. That is why the presumption in Scotland is that those assets should be split 50:50 because, in principle, a marriage is a 50:50 partnership. However, assets brought to a marriage are kept by the parties. That is the difference between the Roman law system and the English or common law system. Indeed the former prevails on the continent. In some continental jurisdictions there is a choice, as there is in France between communauté des biens and séparation des biens. Under the latter, both parties keep their assets
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 436</span>
separately on marriage. Under communauté des biens, the assets are pooled. The code Napoleon is an interesting compromise between Roman law and some elements of customary law. In Scotland, pure civil law applies and the matromonial aspects are those that have accumulated during the marriage. That is what attracts many people—including my hon. Friend—to the formulaic approach. It applies only to a part of the assets—if the majority of the pension assets are accumulated before the marriage, only a small portion of them will be split or shared. Many people think that that is just—they regard it as unreasonable that the pension assets of someone who has worked at accumulating a pension while unmarried should subsequently or retrospectively be split.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was about to sit down, but if my hon. Friend wants me to remain on my feet so that he can intervene I shall do so. I must repeat, however, that the Minister has shown his ignorance of a key area. The matter must be resolved before Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend alluded, during discussion of the previous group of amendments, to the example of a man in his 50s who was widowed and who had subsequently entered into an unsuccessful marriage and was divorced. If the Scottish system were adopted, whereby the assets accrued before marriage were not taken into account and the assets accrued during marriage were split equally, such an individual would presumably be dealt with fairly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who is paying flattering attention to my examples. He is right that that is one of many theoretical cases that could be adduced and that it could be resolved if the Scottish system were adopted. I know that he is trying to press me to go the extra mile and say that I prefer the Scottish system to the English, but I am a long way from reaching such a definitive judgment.<br><br>
All the points that my hon. Friend makes are extremely good and I hope that they are also heard by those who are reflecting on these matters outside this Committee. I hope that the Social Security Committee, which has done excellent work on this subject, will return to the matter in due time, as it provides the perfect basis for considering long-term issues and helping to contribute to what might be a new social consensus in England. Due to the scope for unfairness that has been uncovered by our debates on schedule 3, public revulsion at the irrationality and perversity of some of the decisions that courts are likely to make will accelerate the search for an alternative view.<br><br>
Our debates should proceed on a factual basis. We must not be victims of our own or other people's illusions or ignorance. If I can find a reference to illustrate my point about the concept of matrimonial
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0709">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 437</span>
property in Scotland, I hope that it will be possible to read the relevant passage to the Committee on a point of order.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments provide another opportunity to ask why the Bill, which takes account of classic occupational pensions and personal pensions, does not take account of the Government's new product, the stakeholder pension, or the rival Treasury product, the LISA. It is not merely for the amusement of the Committee—although I dare say that it serves that purpose—but for its elucidation that the Government are not being allowed to get through a sitting without having to focus on the LISA, which we have come to think of as an attractive young lady.</span></p>
<p>[KALI MOUNTFORD <i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: While the cat is away, can the mouse begin to play? What is the Treasury's position on LISAs?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I deal with that question, as I spoke about an attractive young lady, you took the Chair, Miss Mountford. It is a great pleasure to be speaking not only under your gaze—whether it be positive, sceptical or quizzical when you are opposite me—but under your chairmanship. You are now able to guide my comments and, although I have not been successfully ruled out of order, you have a chance to take advantage of your new powers to do so. However, I am encouraged to believe that my remarks are, as always, in order.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 438</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough asked me about the LISA. Interestingly, Ministers go out of their way not to mention its name, which reminds me of the practices of primitive tribes and religions. When they come across a deity or spirit of great power, they feel such fear and awe that they dare not mention its name. To do so is blasphemy because that invokes the spirit and gives rise to dangerous consequences, so those tribes and religions devise an elaborate and indirect name. The Minister of State has devised an unmemorable, scarcely comprehensible, bureaucratic anagram for the LISA. I cannot remember what it is, but he is trying desperately to alter the name.</span></p>

<p>The Minister fears the power of the LISA, which will be judged by the market. When it is introduced by the Treasury—if it is—we will see how much people are drawn to it. I hope that people who have an interest in increasing their savings or finding new vehicles for saving will use it. It has every chance of being a successful addition to the panoply of instruments that are available to those who wish to provide for their pensions. That is not the case with the stakeholder pension which was devised for a different purpose when the Government were committed to compulsory pensions for all those earning more than £9,000 a year. The stakeholder pension is inappropriate and has a structure that makes no sense because the Government, in a panic, changed their mind about compulsion.</p>
<p>You have been good, Mr. McWilliam, not to remind me that we have been able to discuss that matter in other contexts. There are important substantive points to be made on the rest of the Bill and I do not wish to undermine the possibility of a general discussion of schedule 4 by pushing the amendment further. In the spirit of focusing on the essentials in our proceedings and avoiding being sidetracked—however tempting that may be—into teasing the Government once more about the LISA, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That this schedule be the Fourth schedule to the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to put some practical questions to the Minister. If he can satisfy me that schedule 4 is in order, we shall not delay matters any further.<br><br>
My first question may appear semantic, but we cannot let potential drafting ambiguities pass unnoticed. Paragraph 1(5)(a) will amend section 25B(1) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 by substituting the word, "arrangement" for the word, "scheme" wherever the latter occurs. Will the Minister explain the distinction between those two words?<br><br>
Paragraph 1(6) will replace subsection 5 of the 1973 Act with the following:
<br><blockquote><p>"(5) The order must express the amount of any payment required to be made by virtue of subsection (4) above as a percentage of the payment which becomes due to the party with pension rights."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0710">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 439</span>
Why must the order express the amount as a percentage? Neither the Bill nor the explanatory notes explains why.<br><br>
Paragraph 1(8) will amend subsection (7) of the 1973 Act as follows:
<br><blockquote><p>"(a) for the words from 'may require any' to 'those benefits' there is substituted 'has a right of commutation under the arrangement, the order may require him to exercise it to any extent'".</p></blockquote>
That is a substantive and potentially sinister point. People can lose considerable sums of money by making wrong decisions about commutation. In many cases, people who were ill advised or not advised, which is even more foolish, have commuted a pension to their later regret. I doubt, Mr. McWilliam, whether you have ever spoken to a constituent who felt that, by commuting a pension, he or she had made a mistake that was revocable. The provision is particularly sinister in that an individual may be ordered to commute all or part of his or her pension. We are opposed in principle to such a concept. Will the Minister explain the rationale behind the granting of that power?<br><br>
Paragraph 3(4) will insert an extraordinary Henry VIII clause into the 1973 Act. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"(2B) Regulations under subsection (2) may make different provision for different cases."</p></blockquote>
I suppose that it is better to make different provision for different cases than to make different provision for the same or similar cases. Nevertheless, the powers will be so wide that it is unclear in what direction regulations might be made. I should be grateful for clarification on that point.<br><br>
Apart from those relatively technical points, we shall not oppose the schedule.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am rather disappointed that the hon. Gentleman decided not to press amendments Nos. 167, 176 and 177 to a vote. They were the first examples of what I have previously described as Beckenham amendments. Unlike other Opposition amendments, which attempted to constrain and reduce pension sharing, they sought to make it more widely available. In practice, they would not have had that effect, but they were an interesting example of a phenomenon to which I drew the Committee's attention last week.<br><br>
The schedule will amend the earmarking and attachment provisions that were inserted into the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 by section 166 of the Pensions Act 1995. It will bring them broadly into line with the pension-sharing provisions. I shall explain the provisions in the schedule for the benefit of the Committee and then respond to the points made by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford, although he lost me about three quarters of the way through his speech, so he may have to tell me again which parts of the schedule he wants clarified.<br><br>
The amendments specify more fully the courts' existing duty to take account of pension rights when considering financial provision on divorce. The provisions make it possible for the courts to order that when a pension comes into payment, part of it may be paid by the pension scheme direct to the former spouse as periodic payments and lump sum orders. We intend to retain those provisions alongside pension sharing
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 440</span>
because they form part of the courts' wide discretionary powers to reach fair solutions in individual cases. We recognise that each family is unique and each case is different. Although the pension attachment provisions have not been widely used to date, some couples will find them more suited to their circumstances than pension sharing. For example, a couple well into retirement may prefer to opt for earmarking instead of pension sharing, as the capital value of the pension in payment at that stage may be small.<br><br>
We have taken the opportunity in the Bill to refine the earmarking and attachment provisions. We intend that attachment orders for periodic payments will be expressed in percentage terms only and not in money terms. This may answer the second point raised by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford. In appropriate circumstances, more than one former spouse will be able to earmark a member spouse's pension without the risk of the total amount earmarked exceeding the total amount of the member's pension. If fixed sums were involved, that would not be possible, but if percentages are used, as in the schedule, the problem is avoided. It is difficult to ring-fence an earmarked amount for one former spouse, but the use of percentages will make it clear how much of the pension has been reserved for former spouses under earmarking and, just as significantly, what remains for the member in retirement.<br><br>
In keeping with the provisions in schedule 3, schedule 4 contains restrictions on the combination of orders allowed under earmarking and pension sharing. A former spouse, who, in relation to that marriage, benefitted under pension sharing by order or agreement, will not be able to obtain an order, for example, earmarking death benefits in relation to the same pension scheme. We want to ensure that a couple who are divorcing can opt for a clean break and be financially independent of each other wherever that is appropriate. The provisions in the schedule will help to achieve that.<br><br>
We have introduced provisions covering overpayments, discharge from liability and the valuation of pension rights by the courts. We have also provided for regulations covering the supply of information and valuation by a pension scheme to a court. Pension schemes will be able to recover their charges for that and for complying with earmarking or attachment orders and, where appropriate, some of the regulation-making powers are being passed from the Lord Chancellor to the Secretary of State, who has overall responsibility for the regulation of pension schemes.<br><br>
The schedule complements the provisions in schedule 3 and we believe that they will improve the operation of pension earmarking.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard Flight <span class='memberconstituency'>(Arundel and South Downs)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify whether percentages, when they are ordered by a court, will apply to the amount of pension being paid at any one time in the future or to the pension when it starts? If the financial markets were distressed, there might be widespread pension reductions in this country, notwithstanding the 1995
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0711">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 441</span>
Act, which offers some protection. Could a court order conflict with a reduced pension, which was being paid subsequent to the order? If there were a reduction, would it be shared fairly pro rata, under the mechanisms that the Under-Secretary described?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it would be. A percentage of the pension in payment, whatever it is at a given time, is earmarked for the former spouse.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford asked why the schedule will substitute the word "arrangement" for the word "scheme" in section 25B of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. Section 25B contains earmarking provisions. The phrase "pension ararngement" is referred to in section 25D(3) and it is amended in paragraph 3(5) of the schedule. That phrase is wider than the phrase "pension scheme", which is contained in the 1973 Act. I hope that that clears up any confusion on that matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that explanation, but in what sense is the term "pension arrangement" wider? What is contained in the one phrase that is not contained in the other?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the 1973 Act was drafted, pension sharing was not envisaged, but it is now. By ensuring consistency in terminology, we reflect that wider sense of what is envisaged.<br><br>
I have already discussed the reason for referring to percentages. The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford felt that there was something sinister about commutation. I have examined the use of that word in paragraph 1(8)(b), which is at the top of page 73, but I do not see anything sinister in it. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will explain what he means.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For the Minister's convenience, the word first appears at the bottom of page 72, in paragraph 1(8)(a), which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"for the words from 'may require any' to 'those benefits' there is substituted 'has a right of commutation under the arrangement, the order may require him to exercise it to any extent'.</p></blockquote>
The Minister wants to add the last phrase, which relates to the rights of a pension holder, to the 1973 Act. It suggests that anyone who is the victim of a pension-sharing order may be forced to commute the pension. I have already explained how it is a great mistake to do so in many circumstances—the individual may suffer considerable losses. We are concerned about the fact that people may be forced to take that decision, which is not in their interest. That will involve a form of enforced mis-selling—a person will be forced to do something that will reduce the value of the pension for which he has saved and to which his employer has contributed. That is the most important point that I raised in relation to the schedule and I hope that the Minister will consider it carefully.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A court can require the party to transform some of the value of the pension into a lump sum, which can be earmarked for the benefit of the other party, but only if the party already has a right to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 442</span>
commute benefits. A court cannot change the terms of the pension scheme to force commutation if that right does not exist.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the Minister has completely followed my argument. Commutation can involve transforming a prospective flow of pension income into a current lump sum. That may be a foolish decision in many cases, but whatever it does, it does not provide a basis for earmarking, which always involves earmarking a pension in payment.<br><br>
Commutation would reduce, possibly to nothing, the pension in payment. The Minister referred to commutation providing for the earmarking of a lump sum. It is not lump sums that are earmarked, but pensions in payment, so the Minister is confused. Commutation would reduce the pension income that might be subject to earmarking and could abolish it altogether, which would mean that an earmarking order would have no effect. Therefore, earmarking seems to be completely irrelevant in this context. I remain very concerned about commutation and would be grateful for an assurance on that point.</span></p>
<p>6.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The position that I set out remains. I am not persuaded that the hon. Gentleman's remarks change that. The court can require transformation of some of the value of the pension into a lump sum, which can be earmarked for the benefit of the other party, but only if the party already has a right to commute benefits. I have not grasped the difficulty that the hon. Gentleman is bringing to the Committee's attention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Imagine that a pension scheme includes the right to commute 20 per cent. into a tax-free capital sum, which might or might not be a good thing for someone to do. If a pension is split, will the court have the power to force the pension scheme member to accept, willy-nilly, that, in a 50:50 split, he will receive 10 per cent. as a lump sum and 40 per cent. paid by way of pension income, or is the commutation purely in respect of the beneficiary? In other words, might it be that the wife will receive her 10 per cent. commutation and 40 per cent. pension, but her ex-spouse will continue to receive 50 per cent. of all income? That seems to be the question, but it must be wrong to force someone, against his or her will, to commute part of what they will potentially receive.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a matter for the court. The Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 provides:
<br><blockquote><p>"Where the party with pension rights may require any benefits which he has or is likely to have … the order may require him to commute the whole or part of those benefits."</p></blockquote>
That provision is already in place.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford raised a fourth point, but unfortunately I lost track of it. If he wants to put it to me again, I shall respond to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister confirmed my worst fears in raising the point about commutation. Enforced commutation is very sinister and we reject it entirely.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0712">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 443</span>
My other point related to the more extravagantly open-ended and, therefore, completely uncontrollable powers that the Government are assuming to write regulations. I drew the Committee's attentions to paragraph 3(4), which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"(2B) Regulations under subsection (2) may make different provision for different cases."</p></blockquote>
I simply ask the Minister for elucidation on that point. It is not an important substantive point, as was the one about commutation, but if the Minister can give me any guidance about what that means and how it is likely to be applied, I should be interested to hear it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To return to the substantive point, the Bill does not change what is already in place. I am sorry, but I must ask the hon. Gentleman again: which section does his question refer to?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Page 74, paragraph 3(4), line 34, subsection (2B).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. I do not know, off the top of my head, what is envisaged in subsection (2B), but I shall gladly write to the hon. Gentleman and set out what it proposes. He frequently objects to the conventions that run through our legislation and give similar powers. There is nothing different in what we propose.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that assurance. I make no apology for using the Committee to produce better legislation. If vague, imprecise phrases that have run through legislation since the 14th century contain seeds of confusion, additional cost or injustice, I shall continue to draw attention to them and ask for explanations. However, in light of the Minister's other comments, for which I am grateful, and because we have discussed commutation, about which we can do little at this stage, I shall not oppose the schedule.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Schedule 4 agreed to.</i></p>
</section>
<div class='clause'><span class='label label-warning'>clause</span>
Clause 18</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
EXTENSION TO OVERSEAS DIVORCES ETC</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: An omission from the Pensions Act 1995 meant that the rules on pension earmarking and attachment did not apply to couples who divorced or had their marriages annulled overseas, but who made their financial arrangements in England and Wales. The clause corrects that oversight by amending part III of the Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984 to bring it into line, as far as possible, with the relevant provisions of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, I have a question for the Minister. It relates to subsection (2) of clause 18 and new subsection (3A), which the clause inserts into the 1984 Act. Subsection (3A)(a) contains a strange phrase. It states:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 444</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"so far as relating to paragraph (a) of section 25(2) of the 1973 Act, include any benefits under a pension arrangement which a party to the marriage has or is likely to have (whether or not in the foreseeable future)".</p></blockquote>
I understand what the Government are trying to do about the benefits that parties enjoy under pension arrangements. They refer to them as being benefits that a party enjoys under a pension arrangement
<br><blockquote><p>"which a party to the marriage has".</p></blockquote>
But, if a party does not have a pension arrangement, how the devil are the courts to know that the party is likely to have a pension arrangement
<br><blockquote><p>"whether or not in the foreseeable future"?</p></blockquote>
What an extraordinary idea! The Bill appears to place a requirement on the courts to split benefits under existing pension arrangements, which we understand is the thrust of the Bill, and to take account of pension arrangements that are not in existence. If a party is likely to have a pension, but not in the foreseeable future, presumably the courts cannot foresee it. How can the courts take into account a pension arrangement that cannot be foreseen at the time of the divorce and split? I am completely mystified by the phrase and I would be grateful for some elucidation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is another case where we have used terminology and phraseology that appears in other legislation. The aim is to bring the Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984 in line with the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. The intention is to draw the power widely so that the courts can take into account as wide a range of relevant provisions when reaching a determination. The language allows them to do that. Legislation often reads oddly, but the clause has the intended effect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that the clause reads not just oddly, but nonsensically. I was hoping for an explanation, and I have not had one. All that I have had by way of an explanation is that this phrase occurs somewhere else in the corpus of legislation. The Minister appears to think that what he should do to earn his salary is recycle existing nonsense. That is not good enough.<br><br>
Before we pass any phrase or clause in the Bill, the Committee must be satisfied that it has a real, necessary and, as far as possible, unambiguous meaning. The Minister has just acknowledged that, on all three criteria, this phrase does not qualify. He is incapable of explaining what the phrase means. It is nonsense to say that one can take into account a pension arrangement that does not currently exist and will not exist in the foreseeable future. This is becoming a complete farce. The Minister acknowledges that he is trying to write into the legislation phrases that are unnecessary and that he does not understand.<br><br>
As I have said before, and will no doubt have to say again, the enormous Labour majority is ready and willing to march into the Lobby to vote for any kind of nonsense. This is an especially choice piece of nonsense which I expect Labour Members will vote for in a few moments.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 445</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no ambiguity here, and there is nothing nonsensical. As I said, this provision reproduces the language and phraseology that works well in section 25(2) of the 1973 Act.<br><br>
The reference that is perhaps puzzling the hon. Gentleman is about the benefits that one of the parties is likely to have in the foreseeable future. An example of that is a lump sum, which is a benefit that may come into play in the foreseeable future. Expressing the clause in that way allows for that to be taken into account in the settlement, as it probably should be.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Clause 18 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I informed the Committee that I intended to break at 7 o'clock, but it is so close to 7 o'clock that it would be unfair to ask the hon.
