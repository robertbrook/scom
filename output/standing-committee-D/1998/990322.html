	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (Mr. Chris Smith)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft New Opportunities Fund (Specification of Initiatives) Order 1999.</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the order is to specify the three new initiatives that will be funded by the national lottery through the New Opportunities Fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the July 1997 White Paper, the Government announced the intention to establish a new lottery distributor—the New Opportunities Fund—to support initiatives in health, education and the environment. The fund—NOF as it is generally known—was established by the National Lottery Act 1998.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
NOF supports innovative, specific and time-limited initiatives on health, education and the environment. Like the other lottery distributors, NOF will support only initiatives that are additional to programmes that are funded from taxation. The initiatives that are proposed in the Order will not substitute for services for which the Government already pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first three initiatives to be funded by NOF are already well known. They will support regular out-of-school activities, the training of teachers and librarians in the use of information and communications technology, and a network of healthy liviing centres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will recall that we were able to create NOF without disadvantaging the existing good causes. They were originally told to plan on the basis that they would get 20 per cent, of the £9 billion that was expected to be raised over the course of the operator's licence, which ends in September 2001. That amounted to £1.8 billion each. In the event, it became clear that the national lottery was likely to raise an additional £1 billion, which would take income for the good causes to £10 billion. That additional £1 billion made possible the first three NOF programmes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We now estimate that income to the good causes will be at least £10.6 billion over the lifetime of the current licence. That is £600 million more than our previous estimate. We announced in September that that additional money would be split between NOF, which would get an additional £400 million, and arts, sport, heritage and charities, which would get an additional £50 million each. Rather than £1.8 billion each, the arts, sport, heritage and charities can now expect £1.85 billion each over the life of the licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
In deciding how best to allocate the additional £600 million, we kept in mind the pressures on the good causes. We also needed to balance that against the opportunity to use the additional money for pressing priorities in health, education and the environment. The split strikes the balance. It gives arts, sport, heritage and charities £50 million more than was originally expected, and allows NOF to launch significant new initiatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have discussed with the distribution bodies how they would prefer matters to be handled. They decided that they would prefer a reduction as early as possible, followed by a return to their current percentage shares. That is what the apportionment of money in the National Lottery (Distribution Fund) Order 1999 does; that order came into force on 15 February. The order temporarily adjusts the shares of national lottery income to good causes to provide NOF with the extra income that it needs to launch the new initiatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We published our proposals for the new initiatives in the consultation document "New Links for the Lottery" in November. We received 328 responses. I am grateful to all those who responded, the vast majority of whom welcomed our ideas. The draft directions, which I sent to members of the Committee last Thursday, and which set the framework for the new initiatives, have been developed with the benefit of the many useful comments that were made. I shall outline the main themes arising from the consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was suggested that NOF initiatives should complement each other, existing provision and other lottery funding. People said that the application forms should be simple and user-friendly. Concern was expressed about the ability of community-led projects to guarantee long-term sustainability and to provide long-term maintenance. There was also concern that partnership funding requirements might hinder some groups. There were concerns about a possible breach of additionality. It was suggested that three years was too short a time for initiatives to develop. There were calls for the land fund to apply not just in Scotland but in other parts of the United Kingdom. There was support for NOF recognition of people with disabilities, and it was suggested that it should provide funding to trained volunteers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have taken account of all those suggestions, and have changed the draft policy directions where necessary. We have also listened to the many respondents who were keen that we should not try to do too much with too little. I can therefore inform the Committee that we have increased the funding available to NOF for these initiatives from £400 million to £500 million. The extra money anticipates income that will accrue to NOF after the end of the current licence period. I shall outline our proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the cancer prevention, detection, treatment and care programme will build on local fundraising to address local needs. It will help to complement the existing aims of the national health service to provide high-quality cancer services for all. It will strengthen health promotion by developing innovative techniques for giving information about cancer prevention and detection, and for developing partnerships to promote
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0271">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
healthy living. It will improve access and awareness in communities of the benefits of screening, and will ensure that all screening programmes have modern screening and diagnostic equipment. It will also help to reduce waiting times for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer by investing in replacement or additional high-tech equipment that it would not otherwise have been possible to provide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This new lottery spending will of course be in addition to the settlement for health services that was agreed in the comprehensive spending review. It will be additional to Exchequer funding, rather than a substitute for it. The initiative demonstrates the Government's commitment to spreading the benefits of the lottery more widely. The lottery's long-term success depends on retaining and reinforcing public confidence in its power to address the issues that most concern ordinary people. That is surely what this and other initiatives do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One hundred and fifty million pounds will be available to fund the initiative. It will build on the tradition of voluntary support and the £140 million a year that is already provided by charitable and voluntary groups in support of the fight against cancer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the green spaces and sustainable communities initiative will help urban and rural communities across the UK to understand, improve and care for their natural and living environment, and improve the overall quality of their surroundings. It will have two main strands. The first strand is creating, preserving, improving or promoting access to green spaces that are of educational, recreational or environmental value to the community, including by the acquisition of land. Secondly, the initiative will encourage small community-based projects which engage local people in improving and caring for their environment and in promoting sustainable development. For this initiative, £125 million will be available—75 per cent, of which will be directed at the green spaces strand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A theme throughout the initiative is meeting community needs. Communities put a high priority on the quality of their environment, but that means different things to different communities. For example, in a rural community, access to open land may be an issue. For urban communities, providing safe routes to school might be a higher priority. The initiative will help to address the dearth of playing fields that resulted from the policy of selling them off. It will help communities like the Isle of Eigg in Scotland to acquire and care for land. It will help to reclaim derelict parts of our country, and help to knit communities together as part of our agenda to bring about social inclusion. It is NOF's first environmental initiative, and it shows our determination to ensure that lottery funds make a real difference to everyone, wherever in the United Kingdom they live.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Gray 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Wiltshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State confirm that this part of the measure has nothing whatever to do with the right of access proposals that the Minister for the Environment, the
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
right hon. Member for Oldham, West and Royton (Mr. Meacher) announced last week? Article (2)(b) refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the promotion and management of access to the countryside and to other land which is (or is to be) open to the public".</p></blockquote>
Does that mean not so much other people's land as land that is owned by local authorities or public bodies?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am talking about any land that is of use and interest to people's local communities. That may mean, at present, land that is open for access in the normal way by the permission of the landowner or by the use of rights of way. I dearly hope that when the legislation that was promised by my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment has been enacted, the initiative will be able to assist in those purposes. It cannot do so at present because that legislation has not yet passed before the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the aims of the community access to lifelong learning initiative are simple: to engage more adults in learning at community level and to increase community access to information and communications technology. It will do that by supporting the development of a nationwide network of learning centres, with ICT access to information and learning. The sum of £200 million will be available to support the development of community grids for learning and the equipping and networking of public libraries to provide learning centres for everyone, wherever they live. Funding for community grids for learning will provide central information technology websites for joining up services between education, libraries, leisure, health, transport and the environment at local level. The grids will provide community information for local people. They will be linked to the national grid for learning, the public library network and the university for industry, so that local good practice and information can be shared nationally and in a variety of learning contexts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The public library network is a programme for equipping and networking public libraries in order to join them to the national grid for learning and the university for industry. The initiative's support for libraries will complement the equipping of schools under the national grid for learning. It will unlock the potential of public libraries, which are ideally placed to bring the learning age into every community. The initiative builds on NOF's initiative to train teachers and librarians and to digitise content to support lifelong learning. It will complement the learning centre programme that was launched by my right hon. Friends the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Education and Employment, providing more than £400 million extra of taxpayers' money to raise standards and increase learning opportunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, I turn to summer schools. Our consolation paper proposed an expansion of the NOF out-of-school-hours initiative to fund 250,000 new summer school places. The sum of £25 million will be set aside to achieve that. Summer schools include study support programmes run by individual schools and groups of schools, as well as children's universities
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0272">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
run by local education authorities and others. Activities may be subject-related or aimed at enhancing the motivation and self-confidence of pupils, to raise their expectation and attainment. The long summer break can hinder pupil's progress, particularly of those from lower socio-economic groups whose reading ability can decline over the summer period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lottery funding will enable many more schools, and others, to offer exciting and effective learning opportunities to complement other summer provision. The Department for Education and Employment is to launch a summer school pilot this summer. The pilots will inform NOF's summer school initiative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order gives effect to policies announced last September. The national lottery has been more successful than anyone imagined. We want to ensure that the lottery provides something for everyone and that the extra money goes where people most want it, and where it is most needed. We have created NOF to ensure that lottery money benefits even more people. The health, education and environmental projects that are eligible for grants under the new plans would not go ahead without lottery money. The initiatives will be additional to Government spending, and not a substitute for it. NOF will be able to start inviting applications under the new initiatives before the end of this year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.46 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Spring 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Suffolk)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Cook, and thank the Secretary of State for explaining the order? Although we want to comment on it, we will not oppose it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The original £400 million that was earmarked for the fund now appears to total £475 million, although the Secretary of State mentioned £500 million. If I am wrong, I would be grateful if he could correct me because there appears to be a difference of £25 million. The Secretary of State also mentioned the time element, concerning the additional sum that will arrive after the expiry of Camelot's licence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is incorrect. The amounts add up to £500 million, which comprises £150 million for cancer, £200 million for lifelong learning, £125 million for green spaces and £25 million for summer schools. That does not amount to £475 million. The hon. Gentleman is welcome to attend a summer school on numeracy if he wishes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spring</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Secretary of State. The £25 million for summer schools was the point at issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the order relating to the new percentages for the new lottery was debated on 3 February in Committee, the Secretary of State admitted that it was a raid on the national lottery via the New Opportunities Fund. It was certainly a defining moment in the history of the national lottery for the Secretary of State to admit that it was being usurped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
The order comes under the umbrella of the New Opportunities Fund. If not only demonstrates the Secretary of State's raid in practice, but reflects the centralisation of control that characterises the National Lottery Act 1998. Indeed, the draft directions on the new initiatives state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport can also give Directions to the New Opportunities Fund … in relation to the initiatives and its Lottery distribution functions. There are two types of direction. Directions issued under Section 43C(1), with which NOF have to comply; and Directions issued under Section 26(1) which NOF have to take into account in determining to whom to award lottery grants."</p></blockquote>
That is a departure from the way in which the original good causes were constructed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am puzzled by the hon. Gentleman's comments. Both sets of powers under which directions will be issued are included in the National Lottery, Etc. Act 1993, which was enacted by his Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spring</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of an admission made in the other place, the Secretary of State will know that the way in which the sixth good cause was established and the powers invested in the Secretary of State differ radically from previous provisions. The function is a centralising one, with which he will be entirely familiar. However, the sixth good cause has been established and we must consider the initiatives before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to article (3), which deals with cancer. It is a tragic fact that 250,000 people in the United Kingdom develop cancer each year. In an average year, 150,000 people suffer from terminal cancer. One third of the population will develop cancer at some point, and one quarter will die as a result. On a personal note, I should add that, in a short space of time, three friends in their forties died from breast cancer. The consequences for their families were tragic. Sadly, breast cancer cases are increasing, but the UK's cancer detection and treatment record is poor compared with some other countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cancer prevention, detection and treatment is a noble and worthwhile cause. However, given its seriousness, we must once again ask whether it is appropriate to use lottery funding to tackle it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 8 March, the secretary of the British Medical Association said in 	<i>The Guardian</i> that it is a sad and disappointing fact that the Government are embracing fundraising to purchase essential equipment and services, rather than providing comprehensive funding for the NHS through general taxation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spring</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is correct to point out that the three main cancer charities give substantial sums of money—I believe that each of them gives in the region of £40 million.

The Secretary of State, of all people, should recall the Government's promise on cancer during the general election campaign. They pledged to give all suspected cancer patients access to specialist cancer services within two weeks of their GP requesting an appointment; to provide that access by 1999 in respect of breast cancer patients, and by 2000 in respect of all other cancer patients; to end waiting lists for cancer surgery; and to commission an urgent study into the use of community hospitals for post-operative care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lottery funding will be used to fight cancer but, in effect, it will also be used to fill the void created by the Government's failure to live up to their pre-election rhetoric. The reality is that the urgent study into community hospitals has yet to begin. Waiting lists have risen and, notably pre-waiting waiting lists have doubled. There is no separate disease classification for cancer. Moreover, the two-week referral pledge has yet to be met. The Government's promises on the NHS—and specifically on cancer—have not been realised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To what extent does the Secretary of State envisage the initiative resulting in collaborative projects with cancer charities such as the Imperial Cancer Research Campaign and Macmillan Cancer Relief? Will those charities be encouraged to bid for moneys on the same basis as health authorities? Will the same criteria for a successful bid be applied? How will outcomes be monitored? What health promotion activities are envisaged? Will they simply complement existing campaigns and strategies?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the environmental initiative of £125 million outlined in article (3)(2). When the Minister for the Environment made his statement to the House on 8 March about access to the countryside, I was interested to note the presence of the Secretary of State beside him. The Secretary of State must be the most popular member of the Cabinet by now. Over seven years he will have given the Chancellor a total of £3.7 billion from the national lottery, involving a departmental sacrificial act of generosity unprecedented in political history.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Through that raid on the lottery, the Secretary of State has made happy men of the Secretary of State for Education and Employment and the Secretary of State for Health—and now the Deputy Prime Minister. Given the amount of largesse that he is dispensing from the original lottery good causes, he will have found another new best friend: the Minister for the Environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As English Nature pointed out, the Government at no stage in their consultation process defined either the need or the demand for greater countryside access. How will that aspect of the initiative be measured? How much land is to be made available for access? There is legitimate concern about that. What legal protection will be available to landowners who want to safeguard sensitive areas of their land? Will money be made available to local authorities and statutory bodies to negotiate and manage access? At present, we have no idea who will sit on the crucial local forums. We need some answers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
Living, as I do, in a rural area, I passionately believe in increased safe and secure access based on voluntary and sensible co-operation—not compulsion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State will be aware of the enormous budgetary pressures on local authorities, especially in rural areas. We need only consider what is happening to small museums, galleries and libraries as a result of those pressures. Inevitably, a legislated right to roam will involve higher costs for farmers and landowners, as a result of broken fences, the maintenance of paths, and so on. When money is distributed, will the initiative take account of the additional financial pressures that they will face? Might they benefit financially from that? I make a plea, echoing the words of the Council for the Protection of Rural England in its response to the White Paper:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Those who live and/or work in the countryside all have a legitimate voice in access debate, alongside other interests."</p></blockquote>
I also note that the initiative will attempt to create new playing fields, at a time when physical education and sport in schools have been hit hard by Government changes to the curriculum. The truth is that nobody in government has the faintest idea what is happening to playing fields in this country—this is not new—because there is no basis on which to measure them. The Government's proposals must be seen in the context of the fact that even the National Playing Fields Association cannot produce hard facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore press the Secretary of State on this point. He will be aware that the new statutory role of the Sports Council was recently invoked. Since 1 January, 26 applications have been considered; only six have been rejected. The right hon. Gentleman will also be aware that the definition of a playing field is problematic. Where is the boundary between a playing field and a recreational space? In practice, there is often little distinction. The initiative affords the right hon. Gentleman the opportunity to give the National Playing Fields Association a proper and clearly defined role in the process. Will he consider giving it some form of statutory involvement?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Secretary of State tell us what discussions the Department has had on the initiative with the Department for Education and Employment? I can only applaud the creation of green spaces and paths and the conservation and promotion of biodiversity—much of which is already done by local authorities and specific conservation groups. The irony of the initiative is that while it is intended to promote green spaces, huge chunks of rural England are being swallowed up, despite vociferous cross-party local objections, because of planning permission that is ultimately granted by the Deputy Prime Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to the initiative relating to lifelong learning for those of 16-plus years old, I note that one of the Government's first attempts to give meaning to their slogan, "Education, education, education" was to attack the maintenance grant for students entering higher education. All members of the Committee will be aware of the reaction to that. Here again, lottery money is being used to pay for core Government expenditure. Indeed, there was no attempt even to disguise that in the press release issued on 11 March by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0274">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, which stated that the new initiative would complement the capital modernisation fund initiative launched that day by the Secretary of State for Education and Employment, the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us hope that the number of libraries that are under unprecedented threat of closure under the Government will not undermine the network of learning centres proposed. There are already excellent examples of links between libraries and schools, as in Croydon, which are to be commended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To be effective, the fund will be working closely with the IT co-ordinating groups announced by the Treasury this month. What does that mean in practice? Would the right hon. Gentleman be kind enough to explain?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note that all the initiatives before us today are to be divided as follows for funding purposes: 77.5 per cent, for England, 11.5 per cent, for Scotland, 6.5 per cent, for Wales and 4.5 per cent, for Northern Ireland. Those figures are based on the relative population and deprivation in each country. I should be grateful for an explanation of how those figures were reached and the definition of "deprivation". Perhaps the Secretary of State would be kind enough to write to me about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am somewhat concerned by the arbitrary nature of the figures. I say that because the right hon. Gentleman will be aware that rates of cancer, for example, vary from one part of the United Kingdom to another, including detection and mortality rates. I simply ask the Secretary of State to reflect on that, given the fixed nature of the figures stated in the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon. Friend given any thought to a curious conundrum in relation to the three initiatives announced in the instrument? All of them can be fulfilled within existing law, with the exception of one. I refer to the Secretary of State's admission a moment ago that a large part of funds for the second initiative will go towards helping promote the right to roam, which is not yet law. I understand that there is a reasonable chance that it may not become law even during this Parliament. Is it not odd that money is being made available from the national lottery to promote something that is not yet law?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spring</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to my hon. Friend for making that point. Nothing about the Secretary of State in this regard would surprise me after all the money for the New Opportunities Fund was taken away in a virtual accounting exercise before it even had parliamentary approval. As far as retrospective action is concerned, we have had a taste of the way in which the New Opportunities Fund was set up. Now money is being set aside potentially for something that has not yet been put on the statute book. Nothing, however, would surprise me about the way in which the national lottery has been treated and the Government's change of attitude towards it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
It is clear that during the consultation on new links for the lottery concern was expressed about possible additional bureaucracy. The introduction of the initiatives may well be very complex, and I ask the Secretary of State to ensure that the paperwork and administrative processes surrounding their establishment and operation is as simple and user-friendly as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.3 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ronnie Fearn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Southport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Secretary of State will be aware, I oppose, in principle, diversion of lottery funding to our core services—health, education and the environment. I believe that those services are essential, and should be covered by general taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I recognise that those arguments have been superseded by events. I am pleased that the successful lottery is providing more funding than was originally envisaged, which makes the impact of the New Opportunities Fund on the other good causes less severe. The New Opportunities Fund, while funding health, education and environmental projects, should provide extra funding for those areas, over and above what are considered core services. It must not replace or bolster existing services. I heard what the Secretary of State said about that in his opening remarks. The projects must be free-standing, rather than tied up with core services. I shall come to that point later. They must provide value for money and, above all, a better quality of life for recipients of the project's benefits. For me, the key point about lottery funding was always that it should provide a better quality of life. Is the Secretary of State confident that all the projects fulfil that aim? For example, I am concerned that cancer treatment projects veer a little too far towards what I would term a core service, especially as the explanatory notes refer to improving access to new and existing provision for patients suspected or diagnosed with cancer. "Improving access" must not be allowed slowly to become "improving existing provision". That is a job for Department of Health funding and the national health service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Gibson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that more linear accelerators in different parts of the country would make a great contribution to solving the problem of different treatments across the country, to which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State referred? Does the hon. Gentleman further agree that ensuring locally accessible treatment for patients with breast and lung cancers would prevent them from having to travel hundreds of miles to the nearest treatment centre?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fearn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I agree entirely. But I still say that that should come within existing provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How confident is the Secretary of State that there are sufficient safeguards to ensure that the criteria are properly met throughout the period in which the New Opportunities Fund will disburse funds? Can he give the names of members of the panel or board that will disburse those funds? I am always concerned about
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0275">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
how certain decisions in relation to the lottery are made. Perhaps he could help me on that in regard to the new fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the age distribution of the beneficiaries of these projects, I am concerned that no age range exists for many categories. For instance, part of the large amount allocated to out-of-school initiatives goes to the youth service, which has always been a Cinderella service sandwiched between school and adult life. But not everyone in the youth service wants to learn how to use technology. How will the youth service benefit from this initiative?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will any specific guidance be given to the funding body on the ages of recipients of funds or the people who will benefit from them? How will the funding body be able to find out that information? I regard that as one of the most difficult matters. I ask the question in the light of regional controversies that have sometimes arisen over other lottery funding, but I am hopeful that it will not need to be asked in future in relation to NOF.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to mention the public library network programme. Some libraries have already linked up with each other and with the internet. How will the New Opportunities Fund ensure that those libraries are not put on the back burner, so to speak? They may not receive help with other aspects of the public library network—I am thinking of staff and user training. Libraries that have already made progress in those areas may not now benefit, although I hope that they will.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I turn to one of the main themes emerging from the consultation document, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"All Lottery distributing bodies are directed to distribute money to projects only where the funding is for a specific, time-limited, purpose. We are committed to this principle because it avoids long-term commitment from the distributors which would progressively consume larger proportions of their income and reduce the availability of resources for new projects. The Policy Directions do, however, permit NOF to use Lottery money to assist progress towards viability beyond the period of the grant wherever possible."</p></blockquote>
How long might that viability period be—is there a definite, final number of years?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Secretary of State can assure me on all those points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.9 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to respond to as many of the points that have been raised as I can. First, a small correction to my earlier intervention on the hon. Member for West Suffolk (Mr. Spring): the section 26 directions are indeed included in the National Lottery, Etc. Act 1993, as I said. The section 43 directions were introduced by the National Lottery Act 1998, and were not in the original Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman made some allegations about the commitments that we made before the election on the treatment of cancer. He seemed to say that they were not being fulfilled. In fact, they are in the process of being fulfilled. The guarantees that have been put in place in the NHS are that everyone should be able to see a specialist within two weeks of their GP requesting an appointment. That will apply to everyone who is
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
suspected of having breast cancer by April 1999 and to other cancers by April 2000. As far as I am aware, those targets are being met. A new monitoring system will be in place from April this year for measuring the achievement of the breast cancer target.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the hon. Gentleman asked whether the NOF funding would enable collaborative projects to be carried out with cancer charities. The answer is very much yes. The purpose of the NOF initiative is to bolster charitable and voluntary fund-raising activity in relation to cancer equipment, treatment and prevention. Many people across the country give voluntarily of time, effort and money in that regard. The initiative will enable lottery funds to assist that process and will, I hope, stimulate even more voluntary activity. That will, of course, include some of the major, established cancer charities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Gibson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend has not mentioned one area in which great efforts are being made on collaboration—cancer care of the patient. Groups such as Macmillan nursing, which the hon. Member for West Suffolk mentioned, and CancerBacup are determined to join in the Government's initiative. That will increase care of and information to the patient and the prevention of cancer, which will prevent the tragedies that my right hon. Friend and Opposition Members mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for mentioning that. The chief executive of Macmillan Cancer Relief said when we announced our initiative last week:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This is a golden opportunity. We must make sure this financial boost is used effectively."</p></blockquote>
The British Medical Association said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The equipment and services are precisely the areas which are currently paid for through local fund-raising or through major cancer charities."</p></blockquote>
We are, therefore, adding to that charitable endeavour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Suffolk asked about the environment initiatives and, in particular, what the initiative on access would do. It can do a whole range of things straight away. For example, I might mention the creation of new parks and the upgrading of existing ones; the improvement of facilities for those with disabilities so that they can explore the countryside more easily; the provision of information about existing or new access opportunities through better way-marking or the provision of local maps and guides; and the provision of information boards in car parks to give people the confidence to leave the car and get out into the open countryside. Those things can happen straight away; they do not depend on the implementation of a right to roam Bill. Of course, once we have a right to roam Act on the statute book, before the next general election, it will ensure that even more of our countryside can be opened up for the ordinary public to enjoy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0276">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin Salter 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Reading, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my right hon. Friend confirm that in addition to the order's other benefits for the environment, the new money could facilitate the creation of local reserves on brown-field or semi-derelict sites adjacent to urban centres?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I can certainly confirm that. I hope that hon. Members throughout the House will encourage local community organisations to identify the opportunities provided by NOF money for transformation of derelict land or the creation of new wildlife areas. An Opposition Member—I think that it was the hon. Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray)—seemed to be concerned that the Government were engaging in retrospective action for the right to roam. Absolutely not. The order contains no element of retrospection at all. There is prospective action, and I am proud of that. The new funding can be used for existing purposes as well as to support the right to roam and better access to the countryside, as and when the House decides to pass the legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be worth recalling that Conservative Members would wholeheartedly support and welcome all the other initiatives to which the Secretary of State referred—they are a good use of the money. Is there not a constitutional difficulty about proposing to use public money for a purpose that is not yet stipulated in law? Lottery money is, after all, public money. It must be at least theoretically possible that the Government's Bill on access to the countryside will fail. I know that this Government will not necessarily accept that, in their arrogant way. If the Bill does fail, however, the order will have allocated public money for a purpose that has not become law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is incorrect, and perversely so. He will recognise that the money is being allocated for a wide range of purposes, including the principle of supporting a right of access to open country for ordinary citizens. Such support currently operates on a voluntary basis, and the money can be used to support that voluntary purpose. If the House in its wisdom decides to introduce a statutory right of access to open country, mountain and moorland, as I very much hope it will, the order may be used in its support. If the House does not decide to pass such legislation, however, the order will not be capable of such use and will continue to be used on a voluntary basis. That seems extremely clear, and is something to be glad about rather than to carp about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Suffolk asked about the creation of new playing fields, which the order will indeed permit. Cavilling about new playing fields comes a little bit rich from the Conservative party. When it was in government, it not only presided over the selling off of thousands of playing fields throughout the country but deliberately encouraged local authorities to do so through directives issued by the Department of the Environment. The hon. Gentleman asked whether the National Playing Fields Association would be involved in assisting any relevant initiatives. The answer is yes—very much so. It is already involved in discussions with my
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
Department about a wide range of playing field and children's play initiatives. We will be delighted to continue those discussions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spring</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to clarify the point. The Secretary of State will recognise that there is currently no means of measuring what is happening to playing fields. No central record is kept, and no Government Department knows the answer. The National Playing Fields Association does not know either. The right hon. Gentleman can airily say that a decline happened under a particular Government, but he has no substantial or measurable evidence. Of course he consults the National Playing Fields Association, as do his Ministers. Can it not have, as the Sports Council does, some sort of statutory role, because it is specifically involved in monitoring, developing and improving this aspect of our national life?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is correct to say that a specific figure has not been established at any stage for the number of playing fields that have been sold off. However, it is widely acknowledged, by the National Playing Fields Association among other bodies, that thousands of playing fields were disposed of during the term of the previous Conservative Government, often by councils on the instruction of guidance notes issued by the Department of the Environment. The statutory role in these matters is performed, rightly, by the statutory body—that is, the Sports Council. Guidance notes issued by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions now provide that cases in which the Sports Council has objected to a proposal to sell off a school or community playing field in a particular area must be referred to the Secretary of State for a decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spring</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all know about the procedures of the Sports Council—we can even measure exactly how many potential sales of playing fields have been objected to. That is not what I was asking about. I should like the Secretary of State to give a straight answer. The National Playing Fields Association is in a unique position to play a statutory role in this matter. The Sports Council has a wide variety of other functions. Will the Secretay of State say whether he would consider giving it a statutory role that it does not currently have?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The National Playing Fields Association, valuable and worthy as it is, is not a statutory body. It is therefore difficult to involve it in such a process in a statutory fashion. The proper procedure in such matters is for the statutory body, which is the Sports Council, to be involved. The National Playing Fields Association will be intimately involved in the entire process on a voluntary basis as a voluntary organisation. It will be carefully consulted and drawn into the process. However, it is extremely difficult to cast it in a statutory role because it is not a creature of statute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Suffolk asked about the split between the countries. That is based on an exact mirror of the split between the countries that is used by the National Lottery Charities Board, and it has been
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0277">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
agreed between ourselves and the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland Offices. It is an assessment that is based on relative population and deprivation in each country. I shall be happy to write to the hon. Member for West Suffolk with further details of the way in which the calculation was arrived at. A specific decision was made not to follow the traditional Barnett formula, which is based primarily on population assessment, precisely because we recognised the point that the hon. Gentleman raised—that is, that levels of deprivation and need vary between the different countries of the United Kingdom. We believed it to be important that the formula for distribution should reflect that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Southport (Mr. Fearn) said that he is opposed to the diversion of lottery money to essential services such as health, education and the environment. I have to say to him that that implies that he regards the arts, sport, heritage and charities as entirely non-essential aspects of government. I believe that they are equally essential services and that a Government who decided not to invest in arts or sport would severely diminish the opportunities of people in this country. Trying to create an artificial distinction between something that is labelled as essential and something that is labelled as non-essential does a great disservice to the traditional original aspects of lottery funding such as arts and sport, to which I imagine the hon. Gentleman is attached.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State admit that in one sentence he has abandoned the principle of additionality in the national lottery?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I will not. The principle of additionality is as follows. We shall make no case-by-case reductions on conventional public spending programmes to take account of awards from the lottery. The money raised by the lottery will not replace public expenditure. That is the principle of additionality and that was the definition given in September 1994 by the then Prime Minister in a speech to English Heritage. The point was further amplified by his then Minister, Baroness Trumpington, who, in a speech in the other place in November 1996 said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government have always made it clear that money raised by the lottery for good causes was and is intended to be additional to public expenditure."</p></blockquote>
She continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In consequence, where the public expenditure programme is increased or decreased, that, in itself, does not prevent, for example, the use of lottery funds to secure projects or programmes beyond the scope of foreseeable affordability but similar to those hitherto financed by public expenditure, or adding lottery funds to the level of affordable public expenditure in any particular area."—[	<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 4 November 1996; Vol. 575, c. 568.]</p></blockquote>
That is not our definition, but the Opposition's definition of additionality. The hon. Member for North Wiltshire is wrong to say that the principle of additionality is being breached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The lottery has always provided extra money to add to the money that the Exchequer has provided, and that principle is as applicable to arts and sport as to health and education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spring</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State explain why he described the establishment of the New Opportunities Fund as a raid?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman cannot recognise irony when he sees it, I am afraid that he lacks even more intelligence than I thought.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fearn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Returning to the Secretary of State's original point, he knows very well my interest in the arts and sport, which has been well voiced in the House. I anticipate that arts and sport come within the out-of-school area?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. I hope that out-of-school clubs will involve not only educational work such as homework, numeracy and literacy, but art, drama, music, sport and physical recreation. I hope that many of the New Opportunities Fund initiatives will be linked to work by lottery distributors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked about the composition of the board. Board members will make decisions about each application. Those decisions will not be made by the Government. The board is chaired by Baroness Jill Pitkeathley. The members of the board are Professor Eric Bolton, Nita Clarke, Dr Siân Griffiths, Melinda Letts, Dugald Mackie, Professor Allan Patmore, Jill Barrow, David Campbell, Jane Hutt and Roisin McDonough. I shall be happy to send the hon. Gentleman a copy of the public notice that was issued when they were appointed. The hon. Member for Southport also asked about the importance of regional distribution, and described the need to ensure that funds are not concentrated in one or two locations. NOF will be under the general direction that I issued, under the terms of the original National Lottery, Etc. Act, to all lottery distributors about the need to ensure a fairer geographical distribution of funds than hitherto.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman expressed the hope that libraries in which there has already been investment—in computer equipment and information and communications technology links, for example—should not lose out while others gain. NOF will not want to penalise those who have thus far been imaginative and innovative. It will want to be even-handed in the way in which it distributes funds. If it displays favouritism in some areas, that will be based entirely on social need and social deprivation, which is in accordance with the general directions to which it is subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman about the duration of NOF grants. It will be for the board to take decisions about individual cases. It is envisaged that the board will examine the needs of different types of project. Normally, I suspect, it would envisage supporting a project for a three to five-year period, during which time resources could be directed towards ensuring that the project had validity beyond the intitial period of funding. NOF cannot put in place permanent, successive funding year after year beyond the intitial three to five-year-period.
