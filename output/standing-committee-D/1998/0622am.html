	<section>
	<div class='title'>EFFECT OF REGISTRATION</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed [17 June]:</i> No. 1, in page 3, line 35, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(5) On registration an employee of the Corporation shall cease to be a Crown Servant.".—[	<i>Mr. Streeter.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Those hon. Members who have not already anticipated my concern for their comfort may, if they wish, remove their jackets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development (Mr. George Foulkes)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I am first on my feet, I shall be the first to welcome you, Mr. Gale, as a more than adequate substitute for Mr. Maxton. Thank you for your kindness in allowing hon. Members, particularly those who have anticipated your remark, to feel less embarrassed than we might otherwise have been.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we adjourned, the hon. Member for South—West Devon (Mr. Streeter) had just finished moving amendment No. 1—with some embarrassment, because I had said earlier that Commonwealth Development Corporation employees are not Crown servants. The amendment is therefore unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of his speech, the hon. Gentleman raised the important matter of consultation with CDC staff. There has been extensive consultation with the staff over the past 18 months. It was spearheaded by an external change management consultancy—I am sure that other members of the Committee will know better than I do exactly what that is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
CDC staff continue to be fully briefed on the progress towards achieving a public-private partnership, and how it will affect their work. That is done in several ways: first, a management-staff forum allows an interchange of views; secondly, an in-house newsletter is published; and, thirdly, direct briefings to all staff via e-mail tell them of the progress of the Commonwealth Development Corporation Bill. I found on Saturday night, to dramatic effect, that that procedure has worked extremely well. I attended a party for one of my ministerial colleagues, and the first person I met was a member of the CDC staff, who told me that he had been reading about the Committee proceedings of the Bill. It really does work. Fortunately, the rest of the party was much better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
The development corporation realises that it must gain the staffs full commitment to the new mandate of the CDC as a public-private partnership. It is keen to involve staff.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gary Streeter 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South-West Devon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take everything that the Minister says as being the absolute truth. At page 20, paragraph 87, the explanatory notes state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There are no direct consequences arising from the Bill, but once the Public-Private Partnership is created CDC employees will no longer be employed by a public body."</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister explain that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They will be employed by a public-private partnership. I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman's question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Streeter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So that we are absolutely clear—instead of being in total darkness as we are now—what is the difference between being employed by a public body and being employed by a public-private partnership? What is the legal status of the employees?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have discussed that point on a number of occasions. We dealt with a series of questions raised by the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) who asked about employees, including whether we had considered the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981. We do not think that they will apply when the CDC becomes CDC plc, because there is no relevant transfer in the meaning of the regulations. There is no transfer of undertakings from one person to another. The CDC will be the same corporate body before and after transformation. Its employees' contracts of employment will simply continue after transformation, and the employer will remain the same legal person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A similar argument applies to employees' pension rights, another subject raised by the hon. Lady. We believe that that statement also holds true for all jurisdictions in which the CDC currently has employees. In the event that continuity of contractual arrangements is not possible in a jurisdiction, the CDC will ensure that affected employees are in no way disadvantaged as a result of transformation. The CDC will continue to review its employment terms and conditions with a view to ensuring that it remains able to attract and retain staff of the calibre necessary to achieve its objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The CDC will be a public limited company, which in some definitions is a public body, but it will be the same legal entity. The employer will be the same person. As the two Opposition spokespersons are eminent lawyers, I know that they will understand that precisely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Streeter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even if the Minister does not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even if I do not. I did not say that—I was merely picking up on what the hon. Gentleman said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the hon. Gentleman raised several points about privatisation and whether the CDC will be privatised or become a public-private partnership. We dealt with that subject on Second Reading and when discussing the sittings motion, and the Opposition have tabled another amendment that provides a further opportunity to discuss it. I am happy to have such a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0219">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
discussion, but I do not think that it is appropriate under the amendment to clause 5.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Streeter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot say that I am overwhelmed and fully intellectually persuaded by the response, but I mentioned at the outset that this was a probing amendment. Given the spirit of the Minister's response, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Cheryl Gillan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chesham and Amersham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 3, in page 8, line 4, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(5A) No securities shall be issued until a memorandum of the Secretary of State setting out how the proceeds of any such issue shall be treated by the Treasury has been laid before and approved by each House of Parliament.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 4, in page 8, line 4, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(5A) Before making a direction under subsection (2) the Secretary of State shall obtain the advice of a panel of not less than 3 financial advisers appointed by him to advise on all matters connected with the issue of securities.".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>No. 5, in page 8, line 6, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(7) No securities shall be issued to a third party unless the proposed balance sheet of the Corporation, as at the date of issue of the said securities, has been laid before and approved by each House of Parliament.".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you to the Committee, Mr. Gale. Having served under your Chairmanship before, I know that you will keep me in order, as Mr. Maxton did last week. I hope that I shall not be too much trouble to you—on this occasion, I want to be trouble only to the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the previous amendment, these are probing amendments and I know that my hon. Friends would like to address certain aspects of them. They shall facilitate a discussion on various issues surrounding the legislation, being designed to help us explore issues about price and how the Government propose to obtain a fair price for the sale of this asset. We need to know how they propose to protect the taxpayer from disposing of the CDC at too low a price. We know that Labour Members are experts in that topic. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] The Government Whip, the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts), proudly acknowledges that fact from a sedentary position. They have continuously and unfairly criticised the privatisation programmes of the previous Government, and it will be interesting to discover how they deal with the issues that we faced now that they wear the mantle of Government—albeit, temporarily, we hope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On this occasion, the Government will not have the disadvantage that we had when in government in that we
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
suffered an Opposition who were not only opposed to privatisation—and not afraid to say it—but threatened to return privatised bodies to the public sector when they came to power. We now know that those threats were merely empty rhetoric. A big fig leaf will be needed to cover the embarrassment of the Minister and the Secretary of State, because they are implementing this Government's first privatisation having vigorously opposed privatisation for many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we were in government and privatising, the then Opposition talked down the prices. In many instances, they did so in an attempt to create a self-fulfilling prophecy. We shall not do that now that we are in opposition; we want to ensure that the CDC is not sold off cheap. Therefore, it is necessary for us to explore to whom it may be sold and what the accompanying costs may be. I have a series of questions about that, and I hope that the Minister will forgive me if I ramble through some of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett) is not a member of the Committee and, therefore, is not allowed to take a seat in the body of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is so nice that you repel boarders, Mr. Gale. I was beginning to think that the Liberal Democrats would outnumber the official Opposition on this occasion. That would be a rare occurrence and, therefore, worth marking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In amendment No. 4, we suggest that a panel of advisers should be consulted. We want to know how the Government propose to take advice on pricing, what advice they have already received, and from whom. Yesterday, the Secretary of State generously offered to arrange for financial advisers and officials to brief members of the Opposition on the tax provisions that have been introduced in the Bill at a very late stage. The Opposition took up that offer, and we are grateful to the Secretary of State for making it. No fewer than three members of Price Waterhouse kindly briefed us. The financial structuring of the CDC has obviously caused serious difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be interesting if the Minister could tell us what remuneration Price Waterhouse has received, what fees have been settled, to what extent contracts have been let and how full those contracts are. If the details are not subject to commercial confidence, will the Minister explain the full extent of the contracts and the terms and conditions on which professional advisers have been retained?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The flotation will involve a merchant bank and stockbrokers to smooth relations with potential investors, and advertising and, possibly, PR consultants to promote interest in the shares. Perhaps the shares will have to be underwritten. Legal and accounting services will be involved. How will the Minister avoid the mistakes of earlier privatisations, from which we learned as the process continued? How will he avoid duplication of activity?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The process can be extensive and patchy. How will the Government ensure that the interests of the consumer, of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0220">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
the companies in which the CDC already carries investments and of employees will be represented? It is all very well for the Minister to boast about jolly social occasions that he manages to find time to attend, at which people chat about their e-mail, internet and newsletter activities, but, on a serious level, how will employees' interests be represented at every stage throughout the privatisation process?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fees are an extremely important element of the process. The most expensive privatisation was that of British Gas, which cost some £159 million—about 3 per cent. of the money raised by it. What percentage is the Minister allowing for fees attached to the privatisation process? Can he give an estimate at this stage? Who has provided that information?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will advisers for the sale be selected? I have already mentioned financial, legal and PR advisers, and merchant banks and stockbrokers. I should like the Minister to give the Committee chapter and verse on the selection process. Good results have been considered a major contribution to achieving a good sale price. Last year was the first year in which, sadly, the CDC's accounts did not fulfil expectations. How will the Minister deal with that failure to perform, and what effect might it have on the pricing of the offer?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will the Minister deal with the flotation process? How does he anticipate fixing the price? In the past, Conservative Governments were accused of requiring a level of oversubscription, not least to try to prove to the public at large that the policy of privatisation was popular. Indeed, the Labour party was primarily guilty of ensuring that that was how the offers were viewed. Will oversubscription be the measure of the popularity of his policy of privatising the CDC? In fixing the price, will he be trying to ensure an excess of applications? If the offer price is low in order to ensure a lot of applications, he will be guilty of selling the CDC off cheap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will the Minister "tell Sid"—I am sure that the Minister will remember that campaign? I want to know the process and programme for doing that and whether incentives will be given to small purchasers of shares. In some privatisations, for example, bonus shares have been given to those who retain their shares for three years; does the Minister envisage that for this privatisation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is fair to ask what advice the Minister has received on salaries and remunerations. We touched briefly on that in our previous sitting, but the Minister should now give a fuller explanation of the salary structures and payroll costs that he envisages and the effects that they might have on privatisation. It would also be an appropriate time for him to explain the figures given on page 52 of the report and accounts of the CDC, which show staff costs rising from £13.2 million in 1997 to £16.3 million in 1998 and operating charges rising from £11.6 million to £17.6 million. I am sure that there is a simple explanation for that, but the rise in overall operating expenditure from £24.8 million to £33.9 million is dramatic and I hope that the Minister will be able to talk us through it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also hope that the Minister will deal with other matters connected to the group of probing amendments,
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
such as how he plans to develop the corporate image of the CDC, which is an essential part of any privatisation? There has been some movement on that and I know that the Minister will talk about developing the infrastructure. How will he choose his market slot? How will he develop the prospectus, which is a key part of the whole privatisation offer? How will he publicise it to investors—telling big Sid, not little Sid? Will there be an opportunity for employee participation? Some insight into his thinking would be appreciated by people outside as well as inside the Committee. I have given the Minister a long list of requirements; he might not be able to respond to all of them, although I hope that he will. I look forward to hearing his comments and hope that I have given him food for thought.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before calling the next speaker, I wish to say that while I am prepared to allow the kind of wide-ranging debate that we have already had on the amendments, it will be on the usual understanding that I shall view a clause stand part debate less favourably.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Streeter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Gale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 4, to which my hon, Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham addressed most of her eloquent remarks, is grouped with amendments Nos. 3 and 5. I have some questions on those amendments, the answers to which will help us understand the Government's thinking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, what is the anticipated destination of the proceeds of sale? There are two ways of divesting oneself of a company. One can hold the shares ready and sell them to a third party. When the Bill is enacted and the Companies Act company—as I cannot prevent myself from calling it—is set up, the Secretary of State, plus a nominee, will own all its shares; the company must have at least two shareholders. The Secretary of State will have in her hand, quite properly, the entire value of the new CDC. Is it intended that she will sell 75 per cent. of those shares as part of the privatisation, or disposal? In that case, the money will end up in the coffers of the Department for International Development and will not go into the new CDC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second method of disposing of the company will be for the Secretary of State to have certain shares, of course, but when the great day for disposal arrives, the CDC will issue new shares to members of the public, institutions or pension funds direct. Therefore, the proceeds of sale, or the consideration for the issue of the shares will go into the coffers of CDC. Those two methods are obviously different. There may be a combination of both, but whichever one is used will make a big difference. We want the new CDC as it starts its operations to have enough cash to invest in emerging companies in pre-emerging markets, so some clarity would be helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked the outgoing managing director of the existing company some weeks ago whether it was anticipated that, in addition to selling shares, the new CDC would borrow on private markets straight away. He said that that was not anticipated and that the proceeds of sale would be adequate to get the company up and running, obviously, that will not happen if the Secretary of State sells her shares and puts the money into the coffers of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0221">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
Department for International Development. I think that the Under-Secretary has understood that point, so I shall not labour it any longer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we read in the annual report of the Department for International Development and the public spending review—I forget its correct title—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The comprehensive spending review.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Streeter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister. That pays me back for the intervention that I made earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looking ahead three years, the proceeds of the sale of the CDC have been anticipated in the amount of money that the Department for International Development will have to spend. We have been reassured that if the sale does not take place in the next three years—that is possible, considering the state of the markets, and so on—the budget will not be reduced. What if the sale of the CDC does take place in the next three years? Will the contribution from the Treasury be reduced, or will the money be icing on the cake and in addition to the projected increase in the Department's project, which I warmly welcome? Will it be icing on the cake, or will it be taken away in, say year two or three by the Treasury making a lower contribution?

That is important because we are concerned about the desirability of the company to private investors. Ethical investors might invest in the company if they felt that it would produce extra revenue for the Department for International Development. Many people—including me—strongly support the excellent work that the Department has done for many years in making a difference all over the developing world. To invest additional resources in that Department, rather than seeing the Chancellor of the Exchequer clawing back some of that money, would be an incentive to people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 5 refers to the state of the balance sheet on the day the disposal takes place. When the Bill is enacted, there will be an interim phase when the company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Secretary of State. I suppose that Government loans will still show on the balance sheet, as well as Government guarantees, and that the existing balance between the CDC's equity and loan investments in companies in pre-emerging markets will be broadly as now, but that that will drift year by year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will the balance sheet look by the time disposal day is reached, whether in one, three or five years' time? What will happen to the existing Government loans? What will happen to the Government guarantees that are in place for existing liabilities? What will be the balance between loans and equity?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that if the company is to attract private investment, its performance in the past three or four years of between 7 and 8 per cent. return on capital will have to increase to about 18 per cent. That is an incredibly tough challenge, and it is the basis of our concern about the company moving away from its developmental objectives. The only response that I get to
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
my constant questioning about how the company can increase its return is that it will shift its loan investments. Instead of lending money on fixed rates of return to developing companies, it will move towards more equity investment, which offers a potentially higher reward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one invests in a winner, one gets back not only 5 per cent. over 10 years; one can end up with a 300 per cent. return. Those who invested in Bill Gates's company 10 years ago no doubt had a pretty good return on their money. In my professional career, I have seen business expansion scheme funds invested in companies that have gone down the tube, while other companies have made lots of money for investors. I understand the potential of switching from loans to equity, but extra risk is involved. A loan can be secured in an asset that is worth something—say property—even in some of these desperately poor countries. If the company goes into liquidation, at least there will be the security of that asset. If the CDC invests only in equity in the future, there will be nothing for it to take back if things go wrong. I do not understand how that can be the panacea to increase the return from 8 to 18 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the very least, I hope that the Minister will tell us what the balance sheet will look like by the time the company is floated and private investment is sought. What will be the make up of loan and equity investments? What interaction will the Government have with the company and its balance sheet after disposal, when it is 75 per cent. owned by private companies and individuals? Is it anticipated that the new CDC will borrow from the Government? Will there ever be circumstances in which the Government will guarantee a liability of the new CDC? If not, what comfort is there for the outside world in the Government remaining as an investor in the company?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government guarantees are wonderful; if all goes well, it costs the taxpayer nothing. People dealing with companies backed by Government guarantees have security and comfort if thinqs go wrong. Will future guarantees be given by the Government to the newly disposed of CDC?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that I have asked a lot of questions, and I hope that another hon. Member will contribute to the debate so that the Minister can marshall his thoughts to give us the fullest possible reply. These are important points. We want to be clear about how the process will work, and to ensure that taxpayers are given a fair price for their investment of 50 years with the company. Will the proceeds of sale go to the Department for International Development or to CDC? Will the Treasury benefit if that happens? What will the balance sheet be like once the Bill is enacted—and, more important, once the company is disposed of? I should be most grateful if the Minister as comprehensive a reply as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Jenny Tonge 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Richmond Park)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to emphasise a few points that have already been made by others. I do not pretend to understand fully what is going on, as my background is not in business. First, I do not understand how a company that made a loss of 8.4 per cent. last year can be made sufficiently attractive to shareholders over a couple of years to persuade them to buy shares, considering the nature of the business and the sort of countries and developments in which it invests, I

do not see how it can be turned around so quickly. Will the Minister explain how that can happen?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham touched on the fact that the Government have increased the proportion of gross domestic product to be spent on overseas aid. I think that it has risen from 0.25 per cent. to 0.35 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In 1997, it was 0.26 pet cent. The provisional figure for 1998 is 0.27 per cent., and the target for two years' time is 0.3 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Tonge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for those figures. It is a bit rich for the official Opposition to complain about the sums going to aid. They were in charge of it for 18 years, during which time the proportion of money going to aid fell. That was disgraceful. The Government are now trying to redress the balance a little.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I clarify the hon. Lady' s view on the matter? Does she believe that the quantity of money that is spent on aid is more important, or is it the quality of that aid that is more important?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Tonge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that quantity and quality are both important. The problem with all aid projects is the difficulty of assessing whether to have more projects simply to ensure that there are some projects of great quality being undertakenldifferent parts of the world. We need both.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The difficulty that the Chair has is that of determining what is and what is not in order. Even by my extraordinarily generous standards, the debate is going rather wide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Tonge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you for your guidance, Mr. Gale, but I did not intervene on myself; it was the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham who intervened on me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My other question is about the proceeds of the sale of shares in the CDC. Will the increased proportion of GDP going into overseas aid include money received from the sale of CDC shares? It has not been made clear whether, in promising an increase, the Government have made provision for, or assumed that, a lot of money will come from the sale of shares. If so, I am even more anxious about the project.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that the three amendments are probing amendments. Indeed, enough questions have been thrown at me to indicate that they are working effectively. I shall try to answer systematically all the questions raised. No doubt Opposition Members will check that as I go along. However, a few questions were not exactly relevant to a public-private partnership and would be more appropriate to privatisation. The procedure will not be a privatisation. I do not know how many times I have to repeat and explain that to get the message across. One or two questions would be more relevant directed to CDC rather than to the Government at this stage, but I shall try to answer them all in a logical order, although they were thrown at me from three different directions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister is not telling us that some of the questions raised in this debate on the probing amendments are not for him to answer. It would disturb my hon. Friends to hear that the Minister was
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
passing the buck away and not taking his departmental responsibility. I hope that I have misunderstood.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the hon. Lady has misunderstood. I would never seek to transfer questions, pass the buck or not accept my responsibility. I would have thought that that was clear last week and again this morning from the way in which I have answered questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both Opposition spokespersons asked questions about who might invest in CDC. The Government and CDC believe that the sale of shares will offer a unique opportunity for investors to gain exposure to emerging markets. After all, CDC has 50 years' experience of investment management in such markets, which makes the share offer an attractive proposition. Final decisions on the focus and scope of the share offer will be taken nearer the time of sale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We expect CDC's unique nature to appeal to a range of investors, including international organisations, such as development banks, those already targeting emerging markets and those interested in moving to what might be described as the poor frontier markets. The ethical funds that I described Thursday will be attracted by CDC's investment focus on poor countries and its strong business principles, as will general institutional stock market investors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Streeter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that the Government have no objection whatever to investment coming from overseas investors?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot imagine any specific difficulty on the subject. Is the hon. Gentleman thinking of people such as the treasurer of the Conservative party? I am Sure that there would be no problem with overseas investors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister tell the Committee whether he would have any problem with investors that were state-owned entities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly not, so such investment is a possibility. There are all sorts of potential investors, including pension funds and individuals. There is great potential. Perhaps my answers to some of her questions will deal with a few matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham asked what type of sale it would be. We ultimately want participation to be as wide as possible. That is why, unless there are overwhelming legal or other reasons, we would not rule out any kind of investor. The hon. Lady mentioned the Sids of the gas privatisation. Although this is not a privatisation, we would consider such private investors to be appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Listing takes time. We may initially have a transitional arrangement, but a decision has not yet been taken. One of the purposes of this debate is that if my hon. Friends, the official Opposition or the Liberal Democrats have any suggestions about the sale, they can put them forward. Of course, we are willing to consider their suggestions as part of the process. We have gone through these matters with the CDC, but not all the decisions have been taken, or need to be taken now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Savidge 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon.

	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall consider my hon. Friend's suggestion. If there were a flotation, perhaps that could happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham asked what the value would be, which is obviously important from our point of view. The hon. Member for South-West Devon asked what will happen to the proceeds when the CDC is sold, and I shall deal with that in a moment. We believe that it is still too early to put a definitive value on the CDC. The value depends on the market's appetite for such an investment opportunity. However, it should be noted that the CDC currently has an investment portfolio of £1.2 billion, which shows the scale of the business and gives an idea of the value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for South-West Devon asked a key question about the sale proceeds. We made it clear in answer to a parliamentary question that he tabled that the sale of shares in the CDC has been included in the comprehensive spending review settlement. I refer him to the answer that he received from my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. She said
	<br><blockquote><p>"I refer to my reply to the hon. Member on 2 November 1998, 	<i>Official Report,</i> column 	<i>301.</i> There was no expectation of any proceeds in 1999–2000. As I have made clear, the figures for the development budget announced at the time of the Comprehensive Spending Review took account of some of the anticipated proceeds in subsequent years from the sale of the Commonwealth Development Corporation. However, if the proceeds were not realised in full, the development budget would nevertheless be maintained at the levels announced for 1999–2000 to 2001–02."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 1 February 1999; Vol. 324, c. 	<i>435.</i>]</p></blockquote>
That also deals with the question asked by the hon. Member for Richmond Park (Dr. Tonge).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Streeter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that, but I keep asking the same question because I am not satisfied with the reply; it does not quite deal with the question that I have asked. We are told that the budget will not be reduced if the sale does not go ahead, and that the sale proceeds have been anticipated for the next three years, but we are not told precisely what proceeds are being anticipated. I understand why that is so—it is market-sensitive information. However, if the proceeds of the sale are larger than expected, will the surplus go into the Department for International Development's budget and will that year's Treasury contribution remain as expected; or will the Chancellor clawback the surplus, which will mean that the investors' money will go directly to the Chancellor, not into the Department's budget?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I make it clear that the Chancellor does not get any of the money; all he does is ensure that it is properly spent by the various Departments for which he has responsibility. On the hon. Gentleman's specific point, the proceeds will go in total into the DFID budget, including in future years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Streeter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that; it is accepted without question, but the Minister has not said what will happen to the anticipated Treasury contribution. Let us suppose that the comprehensive spending review anticipates £100 million being received in year three from the sale of the CDC, and that the Treasury contribution is £2.5 billion—less £100 million, or whatever the anticipated amount is—whereas £150 million is received. Will the
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
Treasury allow that extra £50 million to remain in the DFID budget, and maintain its contribution, or will it reduce its contribution by £50 million? That is important, because if investors believe that their generosity will benefit the DFID budget, that is good and will provide an incentive. However, if they believe that it will simply benefit Treasury coffers, that will not provide an incentive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish that it were that simple. As the hon. Gentleman knows, such a discussion is taking place at the moment, in relation to Kosovo. We have been discussing what the Treasury could provide in relation to Kosovo in addition to the DFID contingency budget. Such unforeseen circumstances arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have received a guarantee that expenditure for the DFID contingency budget for those years will remain at that level even if we do not float the CDC. All the money will go to the CDC. Whether it will do so in that year or in subsequent years is subject to discussion, but there is no question but that all the proceeds from the sale will go to the Department for International Development. Those sale proceeds, as well as additional money from taxation and other proceeds, will enable us to increase our expenditure on international development. The hon. Gentleman's party could not do that for its entire 18 years in government. It cut expenditure year after year. We are increasing it year after year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Streeter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister seems to be giving way, but perhaps he collapsed under the weight of his own hyperbole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not trying to bring politics into the discussion. The Minister will know from the record that I have said that we were wrong to cut the aid budget in the last few years, and I shall say that any time that I need to do so. However, he has not answered my question. He has said that there is a guarantee that the DFID budget will not be deprived, and I understand that. He has said that all proceeds from the sale of the CDC will go into DFID budget coffers, and I understand that, too. I am simply asking what will happen to the Treasury contribution if the CDC proceeds are greater than anticipated? Will it remain constant or be reduced? That is an important point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course it is an important point, but it will not be decided in this Committee. We are negotiating the comprehensive spending review—the name of which the hon. Gentleman did not remember—which covers a rolling three-year period, the new third year of which is now under discussion. We shall argue the case for the development budget in order to ensure that not only all the proceeds from the sale of the CDC, but additional contributions from the Treasury go into our budget. We must argue the case, and present our proposals for expenditure. I do not want to be party political, but the Secretary of State for International Development, my right hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Clare Short), and I have successfully argued that case with the Treasury for the current year and for the next two years, and will continue to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham asked about salaries. We have advertised the chief executive's
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0224">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>53</span>
salary as £150,000. That strikes the right balance between the need to recruit a suitably qualified person and paying such huge salaries as were paid under the privatisations that took place when the Conservatives were in government. We want to ensure that the employment terms and conditions, which are set by the CDC, are sufficient to attract and retain the necessary skills. That is an important point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady asked two specific questions with reference to page 52 of the annual report of the CDC to which I shall, with her permission, return. She also asked about the advice that we have received and how much it cost. I can give her specific details. We received legal, financial and tax advice on the preparation of the public-private partnership, at a total cost of about £1.5 million. We think it crucially important to avoid duplication. If we accepted the amendment, we would have to obtain further advice from a panel of at least three financial advisers before making any direction to CDC to issue securities. We agree that the Government must take appropriate legal, financial and other advice; I have made it clear that we have been doing that and have given an indication of the cost. We are taking advice on all aspects of the CDC PPP, but creating a proliferation of advisers, as the amendment would do, does not necessarily lead to the best advice or value for money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our financial advisers are Credit Suisse First Boston. The hon. Lady asked about the appointment arrangements; the bank was appointed after a competitive process to advise on all the financial aspects of preparation of the PPP. She also asked about the arrangements for future appointments of advisers. I can assure her that we shall, following the normal competitive procedures, continue to seek appropriate financial advice throughout the sale of the majority of its holding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has Credit Suisse First Boston given advice on privatisation in the past?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know, but if it has done so, that would not disqualify it from giving advice on the creation of a public-private partnership. Neither Credit Suisse First Boston nor any other financial advisers are limited to advising on one or other transformation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister misinterprets the reason behind my question. I asked it because I did not think that the bank had been a financial adviser on privatisations in the past, and I wondered whether that was a factor in choosing it. If this is the kind of process that the Minister is trying to make out it is, it would have been helpful if the bank had some experience of privatisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wrongly attributed Machiavellian motives to the hon. Lady; I understood her to suggest that if the bank had been involved with privatisation, that was startling evidence that the proposed change is also a privatisation. However, I now understand her to say that if it had not been involved, that would be an advantage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am saying that it would be an advantage if it had been involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Right. In fact, the bank has changed its name—just to confuse members of the Committee. BZW was our adviser; it then merged with Credit Suisse First
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
Boston. If the hon. Lady can find BZW on her list, she will be able immediately to identify whether it has done any privatisation work, and therefore whether it is good or bad in relation to the entirely different operation of a public-private partnership.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that the Minister has given way to me. Indeed, he has played into my hands. BZW advised extensively on the privatisation of Scottish Electricity, Northern Ireland Electricity and British Steel; I could continue with the list. Even though this change is totally different from privatisation, the Minister obviously thought it best to choose advisers with an extensive knowledge of privatisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Aha! The hon. Lady now reverts to her original argument. By revealing that, I have allowed her to fall into a trap.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Streeter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Joking aside, I am becoming concerned about that aspect of the Minister's response. He claims again and again—I think that he genuinely believes it, which worries me even more—that it is not a privatisation and nothing like one. Let us assume that the whole package is not a privatisation. Surely, a component of a Companies Act company issuing 75 per cent. of its shares to the public is privatisation. Is not the Minister, even on that aspect of the overall package, prepared to go some of the way with us and say that it has many of the hallmarks of privatisation and that the advice should therefore be geared to that end. The Minister should draw on past experience, to ensure that he gets it as right as he possibly can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You have chaired the Committee only for this, its second sitting, Mr. Gale, but I can tell you that on Second Reading and at the Committee's first sitting the hon. Gentleman sought every opportunity and clutched at every straw to try to prove his contention that the transformation was not entirely different from privatisation. I shall not deal with that point now, because I suspect that you would rule me out of order, Mr. Gale. However, I shall have the opportunity later to try once again, if I am allowed, to explain the real and substantial differences between a public-private partnership and privatisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do it now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Lady says from a sedentary position, "Do it now." I would rule it out of order because, although I am perfectly prepared to entertain arguments relating to the performance and appointment of financial advisers, which is the subject of amendment No. 4, we are beginning to stray much wider than the matters covered by the three amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am particularly grateful for that ruling, Mr. Gale. My hon. Friends, too, are deeply grateful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to another question put by the hon. Member for South-West Devon. He asked what the Government will bring to the partnership. We have dealt with some aspects of that matter before. I underline the fact that continued Government endorsement has some specific potential advantages. It will help to protect the CDC's development role. For instance, developing country
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0225">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>
Governments may be wary of selling a majority of the equity in public assets to foreign private investors and may view the CDC as a potentially more acceptable purchaser of assets because of its record and its development mandate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we believe that the Government's role can enhance the CDC's credibility and add weight to its pursuit of best practice in social, environmental and ethical matters. The presence of directors appointed by the Department for International Development will provide CDC with greater and more immediate access to development thinking than it might otherwise have. Finally, potential investors, who see poorer and pre-emerging markets as risky, might be reassured by the Government's involvement. I hope that I have given some idea of the Government's continuing and important role in the transformation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mis-pricings are the key to this group of amendments. Has the Minister considered disposal of the asset in stages?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said earlier that we would decide at a later stage how best to carry out the sale after the transformation to ensure the maximum return. The hon. Lady's suggestion is certainly a possibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 5 would make it necessary to seek Parliament's approval before securities were issued to a third party. It shows that Members are understandably interested in the crucially important subject of CDC's balance sheet. Restructuring the balance sheet will be a key element in the work ahead. It will be essential for CDC to have a balance sheet that will equip it for the challenges of its new role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Members for South-West Devon and for Chesham and Amersham rightly pointed out, CDC's balance sheet is not in the form of a Companies Act company and is not suitable for a PPP. For example, it does not have share capital but simply represents the historic funding that CDC has received from the Government in the form of loans—another point raised by the hon. Member for South-West Devon to which I shall return.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The powers in this clause and in clause 14 are the main ones that we shall use to restructure the balance sheet. They will allow for existing loans to be waived and for the Secretary of State to direct the issue of securities for shared capital, and to create equity and debt securities to allow conversion of interest free loans into loans on commercial terms. The hon. Member for South-West Devon asked about loans in the future and whether they would be equity only. The loans will move from being interest free to being loans on commercial terms in the new financing of CDC and its new balance sheet. Those points might slowly—like a drip feed—help the hon. Gentleman to understand what we mean by public-private partnership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is of mutual interest to the Government, as one of the partners, and to those who buy into CDC for it to have a strong balance sheet. At sale, there will be no conflict between buyer and seller as there could be at a
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
privatisation when the Government are simply selling off a company. Both parties, including the Government with their golden share of 25 per cent., will have a strong interest in the long-term success of CDC in its new role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham, we plan to involve CDC and its staff fully in the process of restructuring. We will seek to agree new capital structure for inclusion in next year's report and accounts, which will be published in April. That will allow CDC to start to build a track record under its new structure, and that timing will allow us to take account of the 1999 results. It is especially important that we do so because, as several hon. Members have said, 1998 was abnormal, which reflected difficult market conditions. In the past, CDC has generally met the 8 per cent. target returns. Before we consider detailed numbers, we have to consider carefully the business plan and the intention for growth, including the speed of the continuing shift to equity investment. Some elements are clear and it may be helpful if I spell them out. First, there is a necessity to balance the needs of business, such as the rate of return, and its capacity for future growth and financial prudence. Secondly, we expect a significant equity base, reflecting the CDC shift to greater risk capital, about which we have already spoken. Thirdly, we would not expect to keep interest-free loans on the balance sheet; that would be a subsidy to shareholders. We are likely to convert the existing Government debt into equity or commercial debt with an appropriate repayment profile. The fact that the Government will initially own 100 per cent. of the equity will not involve any loss of public money. I hope that the broad elements are clear to members of the Committee; the detailed figures and proportions will not be settled until later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have convinced the Committee, particularly Opposition Members, that it is not necessary for Parliament to deal with that. Indeed, there would not be any procedure for doing so, given the complicated and fluid nature of the task in hand. However, the Secretary of State will keep a close eye on the changeover; obviously, while the Government retain their 100 per cent. ownership, the Secretary of State has an important role to play. The Secretary of State is also accountable to Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony McWalter 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hemel Hempstead)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend leaves that point, one problem that the House and the Committee may have in evaluating the Bill is the fact that there are projects that need interest-free loans or the kind of help that the CDC has historically provided. As the CDC moves towards its welcome new role of seeking to fill the black hole in many overseas projects where there is insufficient machinery to allow equity investment, some of us would get worried if its other role, of providing zero interest loans and so on, were abandoned. Although it may not be directly within the letter of the Bill, it would be helpful if my hon. Friend the Minister could ensure that a statement is made of the anticipated provisions for zero interest loans and other such measures, so that we can evaluate the Bill as an enhancement of, rather than merely a shift towards, overseas aid and development.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That question does not fall strictly within the bounds of the amendment, but I am prepared to allow the Minister to answer it briefly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0226">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful because it is important to answer my hon. Friend's question. I shall be brief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend knows, part of the provision of the transformation is to enable the CDC to raise money from the private sector so that more money will come into development and we can raise money on the markets. There are, and will continue to be, other mechanisms for doing that, which will be expanded to deal with the kind of project that my hon. Friend talked about. Our development programme will deal with the kind of projects that he describes, such as soft loans from the World bank.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The great advantage of the CDC transformation is that it will enable, at one and the same time, the money to come into our budget, our work in development to increase and the CDC to go out to the commercial markets to bring in more money for development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am getting to the end of my response to the questions that were asked. My hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-East (Mr. Turner) is cheering—not because he is glad about that, but because he appreciates the comprehensive nature of my reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham asked when the sale would take place. I have dealt with some aspects of that issue. we intend to create a successful long-term partnership, in which the Government will have a significant stake. We are not seeking to exit the CDC, so the decision on the timing of the sale will be taken when it is right for the business. We shall not be rushing into the sale because we need the money; we have a Treasury guarantee about our money over the next few years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, we can go to the market when the time is right. We need to take account of various factors, including the prevailing market sentiment for such investment opportunity as presented by the CDC; the perception of management strength and its ability to deliver; CDC's track record, which we discussed previously; and, the investor's perception of the CDC's prospects. It is certainly not our intention to go to the market too early, before the CDC can show a successful track record. We do not exclude a staged sale, to which the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham referred, but we envisage selling at least 51 per cent. initially, if we felt that that was appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-East (Mr. Turner) will be pleased that I have answered all the questions that were rightly raised by Opposition Members. If not, I am sure that they will come back to me and provide me with another welcome opportunity to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his brave attempt, but I can award him only four out of 10 for his performance. He needs to do a little better, and I hope that we shall have the opportunity to develop further some of the questions that he has left unanswered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's exposé of his financial advisers as being great experts in privatisation nails the fundamental
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
substance of the Bill. It explains the silence of the lambs on the Labour Benches. They are lambs to the slaughter. Labour Members spent 18 years opposing privatisation, but now that the Labour party is in government, they have suddenly seen the light. That must be a great source of embarrassment to Labour Members, hence their lack of participation in the Committee's proceedings. That is a great disappointment, because I feel that they have expertise, which could have been brought to bear on the amendments. Both we and the CDC could have benefited from such expertise. Even the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-East is unaccustomedly quiet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The questions that remain unanswered are serious. How does the Minister envisage developing the corporate image, which is such an important part of the CDC? He mentioned the abnormal results of the previous financial year, but he has yet to give a sufficient explanation about that abnormality. I do not know of any circumstances that will result in better figures from the CDC. It would have been helpful if he had spent some time on how he would develop the corporate image, especially the prospectus, which I asked about specifically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has not told us how he will tell Sid, or publicise the sale to investors. We have the impression that he has not given that too much thought at all. He has given us the opening lines for the brochure—50 years' experience, unique nature, international organisation, and so on. We all know that, but I wanted more detail, such as what opportunities there will be for employee participation. I am disappointed that the Minister has not been forthcoming on such matters. He has already spent £1.5 million on external professional advice. I had hoped that he would give us some idea of the size and scale of the professional fees for privatisation, but yet again, he has not told us about that side of the operations. I should have thought that bringing up such matters under this group of amendments, to avoid lengthy discussions later, was perfectly in order, and I expected the Minister to reply. I was especially disappointed that he did not reply to my question on staffing and administrative costs. I understand that he will come back to me later, but how much later? If he cannot give me a detailed explanation now about what is in the report and accounts of the company, which is wholly Government-owned, I am a little alarmed. I am sorry about that, because I have great affection for him. I am sorry that he is not as good at his job as I had expected, hence the four out of 10 mark.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am pleased to see that he will be considering disposing of the assets in stages. In my keenness to understand the privatisation process, which is the issue that we are discussing, despite the Minister's protestations, I have been looking at the Rock model, especially the two classes of investors—the informed and uninformed, or the insiders and outsiders. The model is as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The informed have information about the future value of a share in an unseasoned public issue that is unavailable to the uninformed. The uninformed hold unbiased probability distributions of the future value of an issue. The informed investors have a fixed amount that they can invest in the issue and in the absence of their participation issues are undersubscribed. However, their demand does not on its own absorb the entire issue: participation by the uninformed is also required. If the issue price fixed in advance of the sale falls below informed investors' valuation then they subscribe, but if it does not then they abstain from bidding.</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0227">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>59</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>As a consequence, uninformed investors face a winner's curse. If they subscribe to an issue that is priced below its true value then informed investors will bid. This increases the probability, that the issue will be oversubscribed and that shares will be rationed.".</p></blockquote>
I could continue, but the implication is that if issues are hard to value, which is obviously the case in this instance, it makes some sense to sell the company or organisation in tranches. In order to avoid mis-pricing, I hope that the Minister will seriously consider disposing of the asset in stages. Perhaps, he might even say whether he thinks that the first sale should be confined to institutions, or certain investors. He may be able to say more about that on clause stand part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to know how the Minister arrived at the figure of 51 per cent. Despite every protestation from the Minister, his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, and other members of the Labour party, it is obvious that the PPP is no more than a privatisation. It is a poor man's privatisation because, as I have said, it is neither fish nor fowl. I am sad that at this stage in the privatisation process, and two years down the line since the Government took office, the Minister cannot provide us with full answers even on these probing amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Streeter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that the Minister did not answer three or four of my points, the most important of which was about whether the proceeds of the sale of the shares held by the Secretary of State will go into the Department for International Development or whether there will be a new share issue whose proceeds will go into the CDC. He said that the proceeds will go to the Department for International Development, but he did not deal with my central point, it is important, and I hope that he will do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister asked whether we had any ideas about the future shape of the company. I take on board the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham about a wise course of action being to sell the company in stages. Once the process is complete, I should like private individuals to be able to invest and to take a close interest in what the CDC does. That is one way in which many people in our country who are passionate about issues in the developing world could make a genuine and lasting contribution and take a close interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I intervened two or three times, it is obvious from the Minister's response that I cannot make him answer my third question about whether the Treasury will withdraw or reduce its contribution if the sale proceeds are greater than anticipated. It is obvious that the Chancellor will keep the icing on the cake. It will not be a bonus or a boost to the CDC or to the DFID budget but will—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Streeter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but unless the Minister can assure me that in his on-going negotiations with No. 11 he will dig in his heels and prevail, we must assume that the Chancellor will keep the bonus or extra money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regrettably, the Minister is in denial. We all know that people can be helped until they own up to their problems. He is creating a legal Companies Act company and
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
selling 75 per cent. of it for cash, but continues to maintain that it is not a privatisation or even a partial privatisation. I anticipate in years to come the Minister—of whom we are all very fond—sitting at a table and saying, "My name is George Foulkes, and I privatised a company." Why can he not admit that the Bill constitutes at least a partial privatisation? There is no other construction on what he is doing. Anything else simply takes one step further what we have heard much about in the past two years—the new Government's incredible device of creating language to suit the circumstances and turning the ordinary meaning of language on its head to suit their intentions. This is a partial privatisation. Will the Minister admit it, get it off his chest, and come out of denial? He can be helped if only he will take that first step. That is what he is doing; why does he not admit it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A reversal of roles is taking place. The hon. Members for South-West Devon and for Chesham and Amersham are both lawyers. In their assessment of my performance—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No I am not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the hon. Lady a lawyer? She certainly acted like a teacher in her assessment of my performance, giving me four out of 10. The hon. Member for South-West Devon, who is a lawyer, acted like a psychologist, describing me as in denial. I shall let him into a secret: I studied psychology, and he suffers from—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Streeter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Delusions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not delusions. The hon. Gentleman suffers from obsessive compulsion. He goes on and on about privatisation, even when doing so moves close to the bounds of order, as you, Mr. Gale, know, to your—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sorrow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Such hesitations are useful. They constitute another psychological technique: if I stop, you provide the correct word, Mr. Gale in this case, "sorrow".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having given her assessment as four out of 10, the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham went on to try to justify it. In her justification, it was clear that she had not succeeded in her task of arguing the case for the amendment. I volunteered the information about BZW in the clear knowledge that it was involved in previous privatisations—or rather, privatisations that took place previously. [	<i>Laughter.</i>] Freud was at work there. I hope that 	<i>Hansard</i> gets that right. I did so to allow her to fall into the trap into which she fell. She went on to ask about the CDC's corporate image, and she volunteered—from my previous statement—some excellent things that can be used in its corporate image, such as "50 years' track record", "international experience", "respected not only in the Commonwealth but in many other countries". Others are its investment policy, which we discussed earlier, its business principles, its focus on equity investment, and, remembering the geographical description that the hon. Lady gave at our first sitting, its local knowledge. The hon. Lady has listed other factors that could be used to sell the CDC, and I am grateful to her; I am sure that the CDC will also be grateful. As I said earlier, we are at an early stage in the transformation of the CDC into a public-private partnership, and any suggestions, from any quarter, are most welcome.

	<span class='label label-info column'>61</span>
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady raised a good point—I undertake to make further inquiries about it—when she asked about employee participation in the share scheme. She asked also about the balance sheet. Although I did a great deal of preparation for our debates, I cannot give a precise answer. However, in relation to the shift to equity, I understand that the CDC's staff have acquired new skills and become involved in some new procedures. The CDC has changed its management consultancy. The costs of preparation for the PPP have been included in the balance sheet. Nevertheless, I undertake to inquire of the CDC the specific reasons for that increase in the balance sheet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the Minister will come back with an answer, but is he saying that those increases in the staff and administration costs are a one-off, direct result of the move to privatisation, or will they be sustained; will there be an increase in salaries to prepare for the move to the private sector? Can the Minister say now whether that is so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot say how much it is; I can say only that it is one of the specific elements. We spoke of other elements earlier—about business principles, training, and a whole range of other things that, by my best guess, are part of the reason for those extra costs. However, I undertake to inquire about the specific reasons for the increases in the costs of staffing and administration shown in the annual report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that generous offer. Will he ensure that that information is with the Committee before the Bill returns to the Floor of the House? Will he also make the information detailed enough so that members of the Committee, some of whom have sweetly confessed that they are not entirely au fait with business procedures, can fully understand it. It should be sufficiently detailed so that we can see, for example, the salary increases, consultancy fees, one-off fees and continuing costs that have resulted in those quite large increases?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly give that undertaking. I am not sure whether I can provide enough evidence on the proceeds of the sale to satisfy the hon. Member for South-West Devon. He has had replies from my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State in written answers; he was given an explanation on Second Reading; and it has been explained to him in Committee. My hon. Friends understand exactly what I am saying. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will come to understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked whether it was in the best interests of the CDC, when considering how to get private capital into it, that private individuals should be involved. I would not be unhappy about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady asked a question about lessons from the privatisations, as opposed to public-private partnerships, that took place under the previous Government. Details of those privatisations are set out in the 61st report of the Public Accounts Committee, and we will take note of them. I assure her that the costs of advisers involved will be nowhere near the costs of those involved in the privatisations—they will not even be in the same ball park. The procedure is different and will not involve the
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
kind of expenditure about which she is concerned on other matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister leaves that point, is he giving an undertaking that the fees to advisers will be considerably less than in any other privatisation? That presumably includes all the costs of sale and associated costs. I would like it clarified that the Minister has given an undertaking that the costs associated with the privatisation will be proportionately less than those in any previous privatisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that; the hon. Lady is putting words into my mouth. She was concerned about the scale—the absolute sum and not the proportionate sum—and I assured her that we are doing all that we can to ensure that the costs involved are kept to a minimum, in terms of fees to advisers and other matters related to the PPP. It does not matter how often she says that it is a privatisation, as it is not; it does not matter how often I say that she is a socialist, as she is not and will continue to be a Conservative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also doing all that we can to make sure that there are no fat cats earning substantial sums of money and huge bonuses such as those involved in the privatisations. This procedure is totally different from those privatisations. Those involved are concerned about development. Of course they want a reasonable return on what they do, but they are not involved to make huge sums of money. Advisers will charge reasonable fees, but we will carry out the process through competitive tender to ensure that we have value for money and seek only necessary advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister estimate the operation's expenses and what percentage of the proceeds he expects them to be?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister raised the issue of executive salaries. will he tell us what he expects to be the percentage increase in the top executive salary in the first year after privatisation or PPP? Will that be reflected in the figures that he has generously offered to provide on the already substantial increases in administrative and salary costs that are reflected in the 1998 report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am being helpful, but I do not think that even Mystic Meg could provide answers to such questions. I have made it clear that decisions are still to be made as to the timing of the transformation and sale and how it will be carried out. The hon. Lady asked me to consider certain points in relation to the sale, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Savidge). If I am to genuinely consider them, it is impossible to make such predictions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise for the length at which I have spoken, Mr. Gale, but I have only been doing what I can to answer the questions. I hope that I have shown that the three amendments are unnecessary. I understand that they were tabled so that information could be sought. I hope that I have either provided the information requested or given an assurance that it will be provided in due course. I am sure that every issue that could possibly be raised on the clause has been dealt with, although that is for you to determine, Mr. Gale. I hope that I have answered the points made, and that the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As is obvious, my hon. Friends and I are not satisfied. We have raised serious issues with the Minister in good faith and in good humour, and he has tried his best. We tabled the amendments as a device to enable discussion to take place so that we could further probe the Minister's thinking, as is our right. I should like to raise a further issue in a debate on the clause as a whole, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I stand by your ruling on clause 16, Mr. Gale. However, I can as easily raise the matter that I wanted to raise under this clause, which deals with the acquisition of securities. The Secretary of State or his nominees will be empowered to acquire securities of the CDC or one of its subsidiaries, subject to Treasury consent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister can explain the position of CDC plc vis-a-vis securities if the
	<br><blockquote><p>"State-backed bank for PFI gets the go-ahead",</p></blockquote>
as reported in 	<i>The Times</i> this morning. I hope that the Minister has considered the implications of that, and that he will explain to the Committee whether that new state-backed bank will be allowed to acquire part of CDC plc. As the Minister said in the previous debate, state-owned investors are committed to invest, and it appears that the new bank will be state owned. The report in 	<i>The Times</i> states
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government has given the go-ahead to radical plans to create a new state-backed bank, UK Capital, aimed at injecting fresh enthusiasm into the Private Finance Initiative.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>An initial fund of some £1.2 billion is envisaged—with £400 million in equity and £800 million in debt. UK Capital's main role would be to provide 'development expenditure' for public sector bodies".</p></blockquote>
I presume that that includes public-private sector partnerships, as the Minister has been at pains to point out that the sale of CDC plc will not be a privatisation as it will involve public ownership. Therefore, that state-backed bank will presumably be able to invest in CDC plc.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The plans have caused alarm in the City, where the prospect of public money competing directly with private cash is viewed as unwelcome."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
One commentator is quoted as saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are not talking about something that competes directly with the private sector in funding deals, but something midway between this and what we have at the moment."</p></blockquote>
I want to know whether the Minister was aware of that serious development, whether he has thought about it, and whether he can tell us how it will affect the acquisition and issue of securities relating to CDC plc.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be unwise for any Minister to give a response based on an article that has appeared in 	<i>The Times.</i> I have heard people respond to stories, give plausible explanations and answers and then find that the stories were entirely false. It would not be wise—I am sure that my hon. Friends would advise me against it—for me to fall into that trap. As the story is speculative, I do not propose to comment on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely disappointed with that answer. The report leads us to believe that the Government have given the go ahead to those plans. If it transpires that the Government have given the go ahead to the plans but the Minister is not aware of it, it would be a great pity for him to say that the press article is speculative. If those plans were being considered, I would have expected the Minister to be privy to that information and at least to have considered how it would affect the CDC.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give an example. I was in my office a couple of weeks ago when I read in 	<i>The Times</i> that I was on holiday. Fortunately, I did not comment on that story, although when I asked the press officer what to do, he said that he could testify that I was in the office because he was there with me. Not everyone believes everything printed in 	<i>The Times</i>—except, perhaps, the share prices.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's holiday plans are hardly comparable to speculation about a state-backed bank. It is obvious that the Minister is not up to speed; indeed, he has wriggled nicely on the end of the hook. That is a great shame. I hope that he will undertake to inquire of the Treasury whether the rumours are true, because the prospect of public money being involved would cause alarm in the City. In an earlier response to me, the Minister said that, when selling off CDC, state-owned investors would be considered. If the City and potential investors have to compete with a state-supported bank, I can foresee problems. I hope that the Minister will take those comments in the spirit in which they were intended, and will provide further and better particulars to members of the Committee before Third Reading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a probing amendment. However, we need to know an awful lot more about the golden share. My questions come under three headings. First, the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0230">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>65</span>
Government seek to take additional rights in the public-private partnership. If it is to be a genuine new creature, those rights should attach to the golden share and not to their 25 per cent. shareholding. My first set of questions are therefore about why the Government want to retain 25 per cent. of the share capital of the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What extra benefit do the Government derive from that? I suggest 15 per cent. in the amendment, but it could be as low as 1 per cent. so long as the golden-share rights are entrenched in the memorandum and articles of association. We have already discussed the advantages of the Government having a shareholding, but why 25 per cent.? Apart from the extra rights attaching to the special share, the other 75 per cent. would give the company the right to pass special resolutions. The Government do not seek to block that. I therefore ask myself—more importantly, I should ask the Minister, but I might give a better reply—why the Government do not keep the golden share and reduce their shareholding to 1 per cent., 5 per cent. or 15 per cent.? More cash would be raised from the sale of the shares for the departmental budget or for the CDC. What is wrong with that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second group of questions is about the special share, details of which are set out in clause 18(1)(b). What is the Government's exit strategy in relation to their golden share? At the briefing on tax yesterday, we were stunned to learn that the Government might one day leave the golden share behind, and that the special tax provisions that we shall discuss this afternoon would then come to an end over time. We have heard nothing from the Government about that proposal in relation to the golden share, so I shall ask the Minister some direct questions. Is the golden share intended to be held indefinitely? If not—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is speaking to amendment No. 12, which is not grouped with amendment No. 6. I am calling them separately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Streeter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg your pardon, Mr. Gale, I ought to have known that. I thought that they were grouped together, but it was foolish of me not to have read the selection list correctly. I shall therefore leave my remarks in relation to minimum shareholding—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Would it facilitate that Committee's discussions to take both amendments? Having issued a selection list, I do not want to bounce any hon. Member—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We would not object.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, with amendment No. 6, it would be convenient to discuss amendment No. 12, in page 8, line 17, after "continues" insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"for a period not exceeding five years".</p></blockquote>
That allows the hon. Gentleman to continue with his point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Streeter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Gale. Do the Government intend to dispose of the golden share or will they hold it indefinitely? If not indefinitely, what sort of time scale do they have in mind? We are not discussing entry to the single currency. If the Government intend to hold the golden share indefinitely, why not say so? Why provide for an exit strategy at all? Will the Minister set out his thinking on that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
The third and by far the most important question is the operation of the golden share. Yesterday—rather at the last minute—we were provided with something that calls itself a memorandum of understanding, which outlines the relationship between the Secretary of State for International Development and the directors of the new CDC, how and when the golden share might operate and when the Secretary of State will intervene in the running of the company. On reading the document this morning, the light began to dawn in my head. Although many of the proposal's characteristics are those of privatisation, the Government are placing many burdens and restrictions on the company. We have heard the expression "golden handcuffs"—a City expression in relation to keeping key people—and I wonder if the Minister is using the golden share to place golden handcuffs on the company in relation to what it can and cannot do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a number of questions on the subject. The opening paragraph of the memorandum of understanding states that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State and CDC … do not intend that this memorandum should create contractual or other legal relations between them."</p></blockquote>
What is the legal impact or status of the memorandum in relation to the operation of the golden share?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The memorandum's third page contains many provisions that set alarm bells ringing in my head. They provide that the Secretary of State will be consulted before the company takes any major decisions. How long will such a consultation process take? What consultation process is expected? What happens if the Secretary of State says to CDC, "No I do not want you to do that"? The memorandum states that the Secretary of State is to be consulted
	<br><blockquote><p>"with regard to any material changes or significant developments other than in the ordinary course of investment business and not included in the … corporate plan."</p></blockquote>
Her permission is to be sought before CDC can extend
	<br><blockquote><p>"its activities into new areas of business, purchasing shares in other companies other than in the ordinary course of investment business, or similarly disposing of significant existing operations".</p></blockquote>
She is to be consulted
	<br><blockquote><p>"in relation to any plans or proposals other than in the ordinary course of investment business which could potentially have significant economic"—</p></blockquote>
—we could go on and on. This morning when I picked up the document for the first time—I do not know when the Government anticipated making it available, but this is the first time that they have mentioned it—I began to see that the old dead hand of socialism will be retained in the CDC. After all that we have begun to believe, and despite many of the Bill's provisions, the nanny state still wants to control the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall have to return to the matter at the next stage, because we have not had time to consider the document in sufficient detail. I am greatly worried about the provisions in the memorandum of understanding, and I hope that the Minister can explain its legal status and how it is intended to operate. If it is to be signed, sealed and delivered, almost any decision that CDC's board of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0231">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>67</span>
directors takes will be subject to consultation with the Secretary of State. That was not the impression that we were given on Second Reading, and the Bill contains nothing to suggest that. It has come like a bolt out of the blue, and will seriously affect the company's freedom to manoeuvre. My hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham is more expert than I on such matters, but I believe that it could seriously affect the value of shares in the company if potential investors were aware of the memorandum of understanding and the extent of control and regulation that the Secretary of State will retain once the process is complete. That is deeply worrying, and I shall want to return to this issue at a later stage. I hope that the Minister will answer some of my preliminary questions about the memorandum of understanding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Tonge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 18 contains the essence of the Bill, and I want to come to grips with its provisions in great detail. The Opposition are obsessed with the word "privatisation". If they had their way, they would privatise everything in sight. Everything must be privatised and the market must let rip. They have a gung-ho attitude. The CDC would be privatised, and ethical principles would go in a matter of 12 months. The business principles would not be adhered to, and the investment policy would change. That is the nature of privatisation, and that is what the Opposition would like. The point of the Bill, if I understand it correctly, and of a public-private partnership is to ensure that the Government retain sufficient control over CDC's proceedings to ensure that it operates ethically and invests in the right sort of business in the right sort of countries. It could not do that if it were entirely privatised. I cannot understand the Opposition's difficulty with the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is rewriting history. The CDC has been in operation for 50 years, and for most of that time it has been under a Conservative Government. She will have noticed that the previous Government considered privatising it, but decided that it was not suitable for privatisation. The hon. Lady is talking through the top of her head.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Tonge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know perfectly well whether I am talking through the top of my head. I suspect that the previous Government did not privatise the CDC because they were advised that if they did so, it would let rip as I have described. They therefore preferred to keep their investment in overseas aid down, not to worry too much about it, and to hope that the CDC would continue—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Chair understands the need for a certain amount of political knockabout. However, the two amendments are extremely specific, and I must ask the hon. Lady to return to the thrust of amendments Nos. 6 and 12.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Tonge</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Gale. In order to do that, I shall refuse to take any more interventions, because they tend to knock me off course somewhat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My understanding is that the Government can keep control of a public-private company by putting certain measures in place, one of which is to retain 25 per cent. of the shares. Conservative Members suggest that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
Government should retain 15 per cent. of the shares, not 25 per cent., but why should they not retain 50 per cent., at least for the first year? Why has 25 per cent. been plucked out of the air? The percentage of shares held could then be gradually reduced. Why could not the percentage be steadily reduced over two or three years to allow more and more public shares to be issued? A more gradual approach might have been more effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned about the length of time that the Government intend to hold the golden share. Presumably, the Government can hold it for as long as they want to. If the Government were to change, the new Administration could introduce a Bill to abolish the golden share. Is that interpretation correct? If so, is that why the tax proposals contain suggestions about what would happen if the golden share no longer existed? I want to make it clear that if this Government continue in power, or if a Liberal Democrat Government came to power after the next general election, the golden share would persist; a Labour or a Liberal Democrat Administration would not end it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My main concern is linked with the golden share and the percentage of shares that the Government can hold—thus enabling them to control the corporation—and involves the relationship between the articles of association and the investment policy and business principles. Because the Government have a golden share, they can take control: any decision on changing the investment policy must be referred to the Secretary of State. I am concerned that that also relates to the business principles. From pages 24 and 25 of the articles of association, it seems that the investment policy is a relatively simple matter, but nevertheless it needs to be strengthened because it refers to "aiming" at a particular percentage of investment, for example, in sub-Saharan countries. A much stronger word than "aiming" should be used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am unclear about the status of the business principles. For example, will their status be similar to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's code of conduct for multinational companies operating abroad? I want those business principles, which constitute the ethical part of the CDC's operations, to be strengthened and incorporated so that they must be adhered to and cannot be changed, otherwise such matters will come back to the Secretary of State and the Government. I want to be assured about those points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall confine my remarks to the memorandum of understanding, which was so thoughtfully provided to us as recently as yesterday—rather late given that it supplements the provisions of the Bill, the articles of association and the business principles and policies. However, I am grateful that we have been provided with the memorandum, so that it is not sprung on unsuspecting potential investors later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for South-West Devon has raised several points already, but I must press the Minister for more detail, because it is the operation of the dead hand of the state—the privileged position of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0232">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>69</span>
Secretary of State, the Department and the Government—that needs probing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much of the memorandum of understanding refers to the process of consultation. Page 2 states that the Secretary of State
	<br><blockquote><p>"would expect to present to Parliament a draft order under section 18(5) of the Act only after consultation with CDC".</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Minister will explain how the process of consultation will operate. Who will carry it out, for how long, and how will it executed by the Secretary of State and the CDC? The memorandum of understanding states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"under section 24 of the Act she may from time to time by order determine that another entity be designated as associated with CDC for the purposes of the Act. She intends to consult CDC before making any such order".</p></blockquote>
What will happen if the CDC does not want the order to be made? What will be the outcome of the consultation process? Will the Secretary of State merely have a duty to drop a line to somebody at the CDC saying that she is taking the various actions covered by the MOU? The Minister cannot expect this document to sit alongside the other documents without explaining the role of the Government and the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The MOU continues with the Secretary of State's functions, stating that
	<br><blockquote><p>"in exercising the special shareholder's power of appointment of two directors, she does not intend to appoint any civil servant of the United Kingdom or anyone who has been a civil servant of the United Kingdom in the six months immediately preceding their appointment, unless previously agreed by CDC."</p></blockquote>
What constitutes agreement? Why would someone that the Secretary of State wishes to appoint be vetoed? Will the Minister explain the circumstances in which he believes that the CDC might withhold such agreement?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More and more handcuffs are being put on the company. What advice has the Minister taken on this document? He appears to be letting the bird free with one hand, but placing a huge shackle on its feet with the other. For example, the CDC must consult the Secretary of State and
	<br><blockquote><p>"inform her in good time before making a first investment in a new country".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want the hon. Lady to go further with any kind of misunderstanding. The memorandum of understanding states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The effective period for this memorandum is from the date of the transformation of The Commonwealth Development Corporation into CDC until the date of the first sale of shares in the capital of CDC".</p></blockquote>
Therefore, it is only for the transition period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister, but I can read too. I understand what he says, but there are also the immortal lines which state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"After the first sale the Secretary of State and CDC may agree to enter into a new memorandum of understanding."</p></blockquote>
I am probing what is in this memorandum of understanding, and what may or may not be continued into a new MOU after only a part sale of the CDC, to which the Minister alluded earlier. How is the CDC supposed
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"to inform her"—</p></blockquote>
the Secretary of State—
	<br><blockquote><p>"in good time before making a first investment in a new country".</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister define "new country" and first investment" and explain how the CDC is expected to inform the Secretary of State? What will happen if the CDC fails to inform the Secretary of State both in the interim period and under a new MOU? Everything that affects the CDC between now and the first sale will be looked at by investors. They will see how the company operates and how it transforms itself. Investors will decide whether to put their money into the new operation on that basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister explain what is meant by the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"to maintain close working relationships with local UK diplomatic posts"?</p></blockquote>
Does it mean the embassies, staff of the Department for International Development or the British Council? Will he define "UK diplomatic posts" and explain how he will monitor and judge whether the CDC has maintained
	<br><blockquote><p>"close working relationships with local UK diplomatic posts"?</p></blockquote>
What does it mean? Will members of the CDC have to be friendly with the first Secretary? Will that suffice? How does the Minister define that undertaking to which he expects the CDC to sign up in the interim period. The CDC will
	<br><blockquote><p>"undertake no long term borrowing from persons other than the Secretary of State other than in the ordinary course of investment business without the Secretary of State's prior approval".</p></blockquote>
In what circumstances would the Secretary of State withhold that approval, and what would be the effect on the CDC if such approval were withheld?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Returning to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Devon, this document purports to create nothing in law in terms of a contract, yet it is sufficiently important to be read alongside those documents that have already been placed in the House concerning the transition of the Organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a serious state of affairs when the Government issue such a memorandum of understanding at the eleventh hour. We have experienced some pretty devious behaviour by the Government during the passage of the Bill. I seem to have broken that little bit of cross-party agreement, but it would be wrong if I did not raise a protest that the tax provisions were introduced at the last minute. However, generous the offer of the briefing, which we all took up, we had to have it because of the late tabling of some very complex tax provisions. A memorandum of understanding suddenly appeared out of the woodwork at that briefing. I am grateful that we have it, otherwise we would be completely in the dark.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important for the Minister to share with the Committee the difficulties that he is having in creating this monster. He is having difficulty, although the Government have had two years to think about it. After that time and £1.3 million-worth of advice, the Minister is still producing rabbits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: £1.5 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0233">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>71</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister, from a sedentary position says that it is £1.5 million, which according to him is not very much. After £1.5 million-worth of professional advice, a memorandum of understanding concerning the Government's role suddenly comes out of the woodwork. it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"After the first sale the Secretary of State and CDC may agree to enter into a new memorandum of understanding."</p></blockquote>
At this stage, we need to know how this existing memorandum of understanding will operate. Can it be revised, or is it written in tablets of stone? How will a new memorandum of understanding be shaped and formed? I hope that the Minister will not duck the answers to these questions, but will give us a full explanation of how he expects the heavy hand of the state to operate on CDC plc.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Heath 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Somerton and Frome)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share one concern with the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham. It is extraordinary to reach this stage in the Bill, and for important pieces of information in the jigsaw of what is being constructed by the Secretary of State and the Minister, to only now come to light. There were extensive discussions in another place on many of the issues but answers came there none. Now we find ourselves with many pieces of paper in our hands—some of which make sense, others less sense, but all of which are critical to our analysis of how effective legislation will be. I differ from the hon. Lady in not seeing the memorandum—in this instance—as the dead hand of state. I see it more as the guarantee of the intentions of the CDC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, some important questions need to be asked about the memorandum of understanding. As we have already heard, it is not a contractual piece of paper—it does not provide for legal guarantees, but is merely a declaration of the intention of the company and the Secretary of State, as the principal, indeed the only, shareholder. That begs questions about what happens if a conflict arises between the undertakings given in the memorandum of understanding, which form part of the company's articles of association, and the company's activities. Which would take precedence? How is it to be determined whether the company is acting in accord with its memorandum of understanding? Would there be any sanction if it were not? How would the Government exercise their rights as the only shareholder in bringing the corporation back into line?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The secondary consideration is to what extent it is amendable. We had a currency for the memorandum of understanding that takes us to the point at which the first shares are made available for sale. Presumably, there is scope for amendment during that period if new circumstances come to light that require a new memorandum of understanding. How would that new memorandum of understanding or the amendments to it be brought before the House? Can the Minister offer us any provision to ensure that the House has scrutiny of the Minister's application of shareholders' rights in case of rewriting the memorandum of understanding or do we simply have to trust the good sense of the Minister at the time?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
The most important thing is the memorandum of understanding that we do not have in the House, the one that will be placed for the golden share following the sale. That is the critical memorandum of understanding which will tell us the relationship between the Government's intentions for the CDC and shareholders' other interests—a balance to which my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond Park referred. How can we be assured that that memorandum of understanding, which indicates the way in which the golden share operates, will affect the future policy and practice of the company, in competition with the interests of other investors who will have bought capital in the country and their legitimate interests in a return on their investment. That is the crucial factor and I hope that the Minister will be able to give the Committee some reassurance that a new memorandum of understanding, negotiated or agreed at the point of sale, will provide the guarantees and protection that Opposition Members, at least, would want in the future development of the CDC. We could thereby be sure that the ethical basis for the company's operation will be consistent not only with its articles of association but with the Government's intentions in introducing the legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity of answering the points raised by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) and others. However, I totally reject any suggestion that the Government have been devious on the matter. I find some of the remarks by Opposition Members astonishing. First we were accused of a privatisation by another name—now it is the dead hand of socialism. Hon. Members cannot have it both ways. As for the issue of providing information, I have been on a number of Standing Committees—too many, I think—and I have never known a Committee be provided with so much. I exclude the Liberal Democrats from my strictures. Since they have been so nice on other matters I shall forgive them. The hon. Lady, however, says that the memorandum of understanding appeared out of the woodwork. I refer her to Second Reading. When I replied to the debate, I said that the fact that it was not a privatisation was
	<br><blockquote><p>"assured through a combination of measures, such as the 25 per cent. shareholding, the golden share, the memorandum of understanding, the deed, the memorandum and articles of association".</p></blockquote>
If Opposition Members had been awake, they would have heard me say that; the clue to their not knowing is the interruption immediately afterwards, to which I replied
	<br><blockquote><p>"If, instead of gossiping among themselves, Conservative Members were to read such articles, they might be a little better advised and more informed."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 24 May 1999; Vol. 332, c. 77.]</p></blockquote>
We now know how they missed the plot.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is being extremely sexist in accusing me of gossiping—as if I would. I hope that he will withdraw that remark. However, I have a serious question. Will the Minister say whether the memorandum of understanding was available in the Library at the same time as the memorandum and articles of association?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it was not. It was not only the hon. Lady who was gossiping, but the hon. Member for South-West Devon. I remember it well. It was perfectly

	<span class='label label-info column'>73</span>
open to them to ask me to have it put in the Library, and I would have agreed to that request immediately. We are providing all sorts of information. I have never known so much information to be provided to a Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The memorandum of understanding deals with the interim arrangements. It is not legally binding. It does not have the precision of a contract. It is a framework document that sets out our intentions. It is not intended to go into the sort of details asked about by the hon. Member for Richmond Park. We have provided the memorandum of understanding to replace the provisions that are provided for by existing legislation so that provisions that have operated very well in the past can operate also during the transition period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Liberal Democrat Members, whom I know to be much more sensible than the other Opposition Members, will accept that we have consulted the CDC about the provisions of the MOU. Of course, it shows how open we are, Mr. Gale. Indeed, I am sure that you will not have seen anything like it on other Standing Committees. If Opposition Members have any specific suggestions on the MOU before it is finalised, we would be willing to consider them. That is a fair offer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A consultancy fee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No fees. A future memorandum of understanding would have to be agreed by both sides, and it could cover a number of the circumstances already outlined. The present MOU has been mutually agreed, but it is a draft document and we are open to consider possible amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Heath</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The memorandum of understanding has no legal standing. Is the Minister saying that if, for some perverse, unforeseen reason, a company were to repudiate its position on the MOU, the only sanction available to the Government would be the one available to any other majority shareholder of a Companies Act company—that is, via a general or a special general meeting of the company?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are also the provisions of the golden share and our 25 per cent. shareholding, which are important in other contexts that I am about to explain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McWalter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am slightly confused about one matter, which I hope that my hon. Friend can clarify. Is not the memorandum of understanding a requirement under section 14 of the Companies Act 1985? If so, I am not sure that one with a life span can suddenly disintegrate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Streeter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the memorandum of association.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for South-West Devon is being very helpful. However, I understand my hon. Friend's confusion between the MOU and the memorandum of association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should tell the hon. Member for Richmond Park that the 25 per cent. shareholding is a minimum. We could hold more than 25 per cent. but not more than 50 per cent. As I said earlier, we have not excluded the possibility of a phased sale. In our previous sitting, I undertook, without a commitment, to reconsider the arrangements for entrenching the business principles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several questions were asked about the golden share. We intend to hold it indefinitely, as long as we are in
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
power, and I was grateful to the hon. Member for Richmond Park for saying that her party also adheres to that. However, we must include provisions to cover the unlikely event—a long time in the future, and God forbid—of a Government of another political complexion. We cannot bind future Governments. The amendment would prevent the Government from holding a golden share for more than five years without obtaining Parliament's approval. I ask my hon. Friends to reject it. We plan to hold the golden share indefinitely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like several others, the hon. Member for Richmond Park asked why the figure is 25 per cent. In practice, a 25 per cent. shareholding is the level below which the CDC could redeem the golden share without Government agreement or a change to the articles. A holding of 25 per cent. was thought appropriate to represent the Government's retention of rights through the golden share. It is the level at which a shareholder can block a special resolution under the Companies Act 1985, and is therefore important from our point of view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Streeter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A special resolution requires 75 per cent. of shareholders to support it. If the Government hold 25 per cent., the other shareholders will hold 75 per cent. Therefore, holding 25 per cent. will not block a special resolution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that a special resolution needs more than 75 per cent. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] We shall check on that. It is an interesting question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Streeter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that 25 per cent. was important because a shareholding below that level would allow other developments. However, he is now in the process of shaping the rules, for the company. Why can he not simply provide that the company has a right to buy back the golden share only if that share falls below 5 5 per cent., for example? He is missing the opportunity to attract another 5 per cent., 10 per cent., 15 per cent. or 20 per cent. of income from private investors by unnecessarily retaining 25 per cent. Would it not be a better bet for the taxpayer to keep the golden share and change the rules?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We could change the rules if we changed the Companies Act. I understood that 25 per cent. was the blocking requirement under that Act, and thought it appropriate to retain that proportion. As the hon. Member for Richmond Park said, that point brings us to the crux of why her party and our party support the Bill and of why it is different from a privatisation. We have the golden share of 25 per cent., the investment agreement, the statement of business principles and the memorandum of understanding for the transition period. Those belt-and-braces provisions prove that this is different from a privatisation. Moreover, not only is 25 per cent. relevant in relation to blocking, but it is important to retain a substantial economic interest so that we do not have a conflict of interest with potential purchasers at the time of sale. (I hope that the hon. Member for South-West Devon will withdraw this unnecessary amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
