	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Local Government Finance (England) Special Grant Report (No. 40).</p></blockquote>
The debate concerns the provision of welcome additional resources for local authorities, which will help prepare the way for an important new programme—namely, quality protects. The purpose of the programme is to ensure that local authority social services departments provide good-quality services for children in need, and that the outcome for such children is significantly improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The quality protects programme, launched last September by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health, is a key part of the Government's strategy for delivering modern, high-quality social services for children. I am glad to say that it has been widely welcomed by local authorities and by the voluntary sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are committed to putting right the failings of the past and making sure that we promote a better outcome for the most vulnerable children—those in the care of local authorities, those in need of protection from abuse and neglect, disabled children and children who are in need as a result of economic and social deprivation or family breakdown. Our expectations for those children have been too low for far too long. It is beyond argument that society has let down such vulnerable children in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can no longer allow those failures to continue; it is time to change direction and make a new start. That is why we have launched the quality protects programme. The evidence of inconsistent quality and poor management in children's services has been clearly documented and has steadily grown. We know from the children's safeguards review report, and from the shocking testimony of young people who have suffered abuse in children's homes, that the risks for children living away from home in the 1970s and 1980s were seriously underestimated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More recently, social services inspectorate reports and joint reviews have demonstrated that the quality of children's services is very inconsistent, both within and between authorities. The reports have shown poor assessment, poor planning and case recording, unnecessary delays, inappropriate placements and haphazard decisions about who should receive particular services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
For all those reasons, the problems can no longer be ignored. The Government have recognised their responsibility to help improve children's services—to provide the right legislative and structural framework; to set objectives and standards and to monitor and inspect services and outcomes. The quality protects programme addresses all those issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main elements of the quality protects programme are as follows. First, new national Government objectives for children's services will, for the first time, set clear outcomes for children, and in some instances give precise targets, which local authorities will be expected to achieve. Secondly, local councillors will have an important role in delivering the programme; my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has sent guidance notes to all councillors. Thirdly, from April 1999, a new special grant of £375 million will be paid over three years for children's services. Finally, all local authorities will be required to submit a quality protects management action plan to the Department of Health by 31 January 1999, to ensure that their plans meet the Government objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new Government objectives for children's services, launched through the quality protects programme and reinforced in the social services White Paper, represent a major step forward and provide a clear framework for developing and improving local services. The objectives involve ensuring that all children have the love, care and support that they need for the whole of their childhood; that children are protected from abuse and neglect; and that the children for whom social services are responsible gain the maximum chance in life from education and other opportunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In particular, we want children who are looked after by local authorities to do better at school, and for there to be more care leavers in training, education or employment. We want fewer moves between placements for such children, and we want there to be less bullying and harassment in children's homes. We want a reduced level of offending among such children, and we want care leavers to be kept in touch with local authorities for longer. They are challenging objectives, but they are achievable. Indeed, they must be achieved if we are to avoid failing those children again in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The commitment of local councillors will be essential to the success of the quality protects initiative. Not only should councillors on social services committees be committed to it, but there should be a corporate commitment by local authorities. Councillors should ensure that services are well managed and that the public receive the services that they need. Councillors must set an overall policy direction to enable officers to deliver services. To do that, they need to understand the nature of the work and its demands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State wrote last September to all councillors in England, setting out their responsibilities and outlining the sort of questions that they should be asking their officers. We have been positively encouraged by the response to that letter. Many
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0232">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
councillors have shown real willingness to become actively involved in the quality protects programme, and we welcome their participation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are supporting the quality protects programme with a substantial investment of new targeted resources. From April, a new children's services special grant will be introduced, providing £375 million over three years to be spent on modernising children's services and ensuring that local authorities have the right systems and structures in place. Local authorities must demonstrate how they will spend the grant on six priorities: first, to increase the choice of adoption, foster care and residential care placements for looked-after children; secondly, to increase the support provided for care leavers, including steps to stop the inappropriate discharge of young people at 16 and 17; thirdly, to improve the management of children's social services, including more and better use of management information systems; fourthly, to improve assessment care planning and record keeping; fifthly, to improve quality assurance systems; and, finally, to listen to the views of children and young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We expect improvements to be delivered in return for the extra resources over the three-year period. We are committed to ensuring that changes are made in children's social services in return for that new investment. The public care system must deliver better results for the children in care: better educational attainment, fewer problems with health and development and less offending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This year, we have provided funding of £5 million to help local authorities with the set-up costs that they will all incur in working on the quality protects initiative. That is the subject of the special grant report. Subject to parliamentary approval of the special grant report, each local authority, with the exception of the Isles of Scilly and the City of London, will be eligible to receive a one-off payment of £32,500, to enable it to prepare for the quality protects initiative. The Isles of Scilly and the City of London will be eligible for grants of up to £3,000. Payment of grant will be dependent on local authorities submitting an acceptable account of how they propose to use the money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities may use this year's grant to audit children's services to identify the local authority position in relation to quality protects key tasks and to identify priorities in relation to action needed in the six priority areas; to undertake preparatory work on the implementation of the quality protects management action plan; to analyse and develop management information systems in children's services and to improve the effective implementation of the system for looking after children—in particular its use in the analysis and development of management information systems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities have submitted their proposals to the Department of Health as part of their management action plans. During the next three years, the special grant will be paid only to local authorities whose management action plans are fully up to standard, and who, in future years, can demonstrate that acceptable
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
progress has been made in implementing their plans. Management action plans will be a key documents in showing how local authorities intend to modernise their services and how well they are delivering in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All local authorities were required to submit their management action plans to the Department of Health by the end of January. I am pleased that all the plans were received on time. The social services inspectorate is engaged in a major evaluation of management action plans. On the basis of its recommendations and subject to parliamentary approval of next year's special grant report, we shall decide whether to pay their special grant allocations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The allocations will be as set out in last December's circular, which gave indicative allocations, except for Rutland and the Isles of Scilly, which, following representations about the indicative allocations, will receive an additional £10,000 each. The social services inspectorate will work with local authorities to try to bring problem management action plans up to scratch, but if, after further discussions, an authority's plan is still unacceptable, I shall not authorise payment of the special grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to the grants for individual local authorities, a small part of the children's social services special grant this year will be devoted to funding new regional development workers. We plan, for next three years, to have eight regional development workers, who will work in partnership with local authorities and the regional offices of social services inspectors to take forward a national programme of training and development work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already appointed all those workers, and earlier today I met them to discuss key targets for the quality protects programme. I am glad to say that they come from a variety of different backgrounds, including social services and health, and will be invaluable in enabling us to deliver the desired outcomes of the quality protects programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Quality protects is a major new programme of change and reform. It provides local authorities with a vital opportunity to make a genuine difference to the lives of vulnerable children, which should be seized by all who are responsible—central Government and local government working in partnership, health, and education authorities and the voluntary and the independent sectors. The special grant is essential to allow local authorities to prepare themselves for the quality protects programme over the next three years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.41 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Philip Hammond 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Runnymede and Weybridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I start by emphasising that the Opposition support the objectives of the quality protects programme. All hon. Members would support those objectives—giving better life chances to children in local authority care, and ensuring that they enjoy greater protection. However, we have anxieties about the Government's approach, in particular, the balance between local and national control. Those anxieties encompass initiatives and departments as we witness the development of the Government's thinking. Although
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0233">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
the Government's rhetoric is of devolving decision making to local authorities, to the nearest possible point to the people, the reality is different—a massive centralisation of power and control and a resulting increase in bureaucracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measure is a good example of those tendencies. Specific national targets are being imposed in an area over which local authorities have had control. Special grants are being offered, which are dependent on the achievement of precise and prescriptive targets reported to the Secretary of State. Not only are outcomes required to meet targets, but many of the measures prescribe the methodologies to be employed. In this case, local authorities are required to prepare management action plans in a format prescribed down to the detail of how a plan should be presented to the Secretary of State, which is included as an annexe to the original circular. The money allocated to the local authority will be used to take the initiative forward under several different headings. Local authorities will even be required to "explain and justify" their proposed allocations between the different priorities for each year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We understand the arguments for national standards in an area as important as child protection and child care. However, we are dealing not with agencies reporting to their controlling Departments, but with elected local councils, which are supposed to be part of the basic democratic structure of our country. Those councils have, rightly, been told in no uncertain terms by the Secretary of State they they are responsible for outcomes. However, the Government have been highly prescriptive about the methodology, the intermediate targets that must be achieved and the prioritisation in reaching those different targets. What is the point of local authority involvement in the process? Why have elected local authorities if the Government are going to turn social services departments into mere agencies or contractors to deliver services in a form prescribed precisely by the Secretary of State which, like sub-contractors, are paid only if they deliver precisely what the Government have set out?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Should not local authorities have autonomy to develop service provision according to local needs? When the Secretary of State announced his proposals in the House of Commons on 5 November, I said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Local councillors are to be held responsible for the quality of services delivered—rightly, in my view. However, with that responsibility must go the right—within a framework of national standards to ensure the safety of children—to exercise discretion over service delivery in meeting the targets set by the Secretary of State."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 5 November 1998; Volume 318, column 1014.]</p></blockquote>
The reality is that the Government's initiative has been seen as necessary because of the abysmal failure of a few social services authorities—almost all Labour-controlled—in some well publicised cases, when the authorities failed to discharge their duties with regard to children in care. All local authorities will be subjected to a highly prescriptive regime because the
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
Government are unwilling to identify and deal with those authorities that have so notably failed in their task.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rhetoric of partnership used throughout the circular is hollow. Local authorities are being turned into little more than agents of the Secretary of State, with rapidly decreasing discretion to plan and implement services in accordance with local needs. I am concerned—as are many of my colleagues—about the direction of the Government's thinking and their commitment to an elected tier of local government that has real power and the discretion to set out priorities and implement national standards in ways that are sensitive and responsive to local needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a further gap in the rhetoric about the desire to reduce bureaucracy, whether in the health service, education or local government. We are familiar with Ministers' talking about their desire to slash bureaucracy and redirect resources to the front line, the reality is different. People working in national health service trusts, health authorities, local authorities or schools say that they are facing an ever-increasing avalanche of circulars, directions and requirements for information from central Government. There has been a huge increase in the volume of directions from the Government and requirements for information to be fed back. More and more specific grants are dependent on such reports back to central Government and the implementation of their instructions. That instinctive, rather sinister centralisation of government has imposed a huge additional burden on local authorities, health authorities and NHS trusts; it distracts staff from front-line service delivery; and it does not help morale in our public services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This measure is a prime example of that tendency. The circular was published on 11 November 1998 requiring local authorities, which wanted their slice of the cake that the Government were making available, to prepare a three-year management action plan—a very detailed document. Local authorities were required to consult health authorities and the voluntary sector and to lodge their completed plan with the Secretary of State by 31 January. I calculate that there were approximately 50 working days from the publication of the circular to the required date for delivery of the plans. I can only begin to imagine what sort of disruption and chaos that burden imposed on local authority social services departments. There were only 50 working days to carry out the consultation requirements and produce a very complex document. Perhaps it is churlish to mention the fact that some Ministers take longer than 50 working days to answer letters from Members of Parliament. This document is far more complex than a simple letter, and it is another example of the unreasonable pressure that the Government have placed on local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some specific questions for the Minister, which I hope that he can answer. Paragraph 12.3 of the circular issued by the Department of Health states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Payment of Year 2 of the grant will be dependent on satisfactory progress … being made in Year 1 in terms of the six priorities".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0234">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
It states that satisfactory progress will be defined in the special grant report, but I have been unable to find it. Local authorities undertaking expenditure in anticipation of payment from the special grant, provided that they have made satisfactory progress, are entitled to expect that the commitment to define such satisfactory progress would be honoured.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister confirm—he may have done so, more or less, in his opening remarks—that the level of grant specified in annexe A is the maximum grant payable and that only actual expenditure incurred during 1998-99 will be reimbursed? Will he also confirm whether adjustments have been made in standard spending assessment calculations for children's services, to take account of the children's services special grant, and say whether any such adjustments will be made?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The circular referred to Rutland and the Minister will recognise that my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton (Mr. Duncan) has a particular interest in the matter. The circular described Rutland as being one of the three authorities, along with the Isles of Stilly and the City of London, to receive a reduced level of grant. Yet, in the first annexe to the report, there is no reference to Rutland. Annexe A refers to the City of London and the Isles of Stilly receiving the reduced level of grant, but in all other cases, grant will be payable at the level of £32,500. Will the Minister clarify whether Rutland has made representations that have resulted in it being given the full grant for the period to 31 March 1999, or say whether there is another explanation for the exclusion of Rutland?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, will the Minister expand his remarks about the appointment of regional development workers? The circular clearly envisaged the appointment of eight regional development workers at a cost of £200,000 for the financial year 1998–99. The Minister surprised me somewhat by saying that all eight had been appointed, yet the report shows that only three authorities—Shropshire, Wiltshire and the City of York—will receive grant payments in respect of regional development workers. The total cost for 1998–99 will be only £60,000, instead of the budgeted £200,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister clarify what has happend in that case? Will he also tell us how many applications for appointment as regional development workers were received and how those appointed were selected? It seems most unsatisfactory that a circular inviting applications should be issued by the Department on 11 November with a closing date of 27 November. It would not be surprising if few applications were received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would the Minister care to comment on the coincidence that one of the authorities to be reimbursed is the City of York, the authority that covers the constituency of the Under-Secretary of State for Social Security, the hon. Member for City of York (Mr. Bayley), who was until recently the Secretary of State's parliamentary private secretary?
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
Could it be that the short notice given in the circular made it difficult for applications to be formulated from areas that had no prior knowledge of it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister say whether he really thinks that the most effective and efficient way to deal with appointments of that nature is to give applicants only a fortnight's notice of the closing date? Does he not agree—perhaps with the benefit of hindsight—that selecting the City of York as a recipient authority might, under the circumstances, give the unfortunate impression that the constituency of someone close to the Secretary of State had been favoured and thus, by implication, that the person in question was aware of the contents of the circular before it was issued?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise again that, despite those detailed points and our broader concern about the Government's tendency to centralise and seek to control in minute detail what local authorities are doing, we support the broad objectives of the quality protects initiative. To that extent, we support the Government's intentions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.57 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Evan Harris 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Oxford, West and Abingdon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Liberal Democrats welcome the objectives of the quality protects programme and recognise that it is a good scheme for delivering those objectives. I share the Minister's view that it has been well received by local government and social services departments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Liberal Democrats also welcome the fact that the initiative has new funding. It is not an instruction to local authorities with no funding attached, which is welcome. The scheme also represents good investment. First, it is an investment in human terms. Obviously, we are dealing with an important time in people's lives and there have been many problems with low-quality provision in that area. Secondly, it is a good investment in financial terms, because investment made now in delivering a good quality of care for young people can save huge amounts, not only in financial terms but in terms of human misery in later life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will not surprise the Minister to know that we have concerns about the level of resources, and I do not necessarily mean the level of resources tied to the project itself. Social services departments have been starved of cash for a long time, not only during the 18 years of the Conservative Government, but during the first two years of the present Government, when social services spending took real-terms cuts because the Government decided to stick to Conservative spending plans. Therefore, we saw real-terms cuts and cash increases of only 1.1 per cent, and 1.2 per cent, in the first two years, once allowance has been made for the special transitional grant covering new duties and comparing like with like.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister accepts that although such initiatives are welcome, they work best when they are given extra funding on top of growth money. It cannot be denied that social services has a good settlement for the year to come, although whether the bust-and-boom approach to funding social services is better than a more gently controlled average is at least debatable. However, the Minister will accept that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0235">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
some authorities have received poor settlements for children's services. Because of the way in which the standard spending assessment has been calculated, some authorities will have to make significant cuts in provision. One example is Oxfordshire—I cite it not just because it is my own authority; had my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr Burstow) been present, he would have done so. When we discussed the draft special grant order, my hon. Friend said that Oxfordshire was particularly badly hit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As that authority has to cope with a 11.5 per cent, cut in SSA for children's services in one year—losing £3.5 million in cash terms, it is difficult to see how, even with the additional funding, it can guarantee improved quality. The Government will also find it difficult to ensure—as I am sure that they will want to do—that the funding allocated for the quality protects initiative is used for additional new measures and not as a substitute for lost posts and lost initiatives resulting from the savage cuts in children's social services. How can such authorities as Oxford, which have to make the significant cuts required by the Government's capping regulations, such as a reduction of 100 in the number of children being looked after—a measure that was agreed by all local parties—achieve improvements, even with the money from the quality protects programme? Even at this late stage, will some flexibility in the use of the funding be introduced? I can understand the Government wanting the initiative delivered, but the Minister must look at how the SSA is working when significant cuts have to be made at the same time as quality is supposed to be raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) referred to central influence and guidance in the initiative. The initiative undeniably involves central guidance and influence. To look on the positive side, as Liberal Democrats try to do, at least the proposal does not involve a bidding process, which would be invidious, especially for such a fundamental provision. At least this year local authorities have been given funding to allocate people the time to develop, in a tight timetable, the management action plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee will be aware that one of the advantages of centralisation is the fact that the Government have to take responsibility. Some of us feel that the people who set the funding amount and raise the funds should take some of the blame if things go wrong. That is why it is invidious to blame local authorities, when the vast majority of their funding comes from central Government and has until this year been cut, year on year, and when capping regimes prevent those authorities, which are charged by the electorate and by statute to deliver services, from raising the funds that they require.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman noted that, in the Secretary of State's letter of 21 September 1998 to all elected councillors, under the heading
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Corporate Responsibility of Local Government",</p></blockquote>
he says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As councillors it is your responsibility to ensure that your council is delivering on these objectives"?</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point. The reason why fewer people are coming forward to serve as councillors is that under the capping regime introduced by the Conservative Government and continued in one form or another by the present Government, councillors are given greater responsibility while being increasingly criticised in the press and by Government Members, without being given adequate funds—after year on year of cuts—or the power to raise their own funds. I shall not labour the point, but the Government should take responsibility for problems and—as is fair—take credit for improvements and clarify whether they are a centralising or a decentralising Government—the point made by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time, it is wrong for the Conservative party to blame the Labour party in local government for the scandals that occur because few local authorities are Conservative controlled. Inevitably, if there are problems, they will generally be found in Labour authorities. However that does not mean that there is cause and effect. In some cases, that might be so, but generally, apart from systematic failures where people have refused to investigate for various reasons—we all know the cases—failures have been due to underfunding. The Conservative party, as well as the Labour party, must answer for year upon year of real-term cuts in social services, when demography shows that the need for children's services has increased.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. George Turner 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-West Norfolk)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree with the Conservative analysis that this is a problem of isolated cases; or does he share my belief that, beyond the isolated cases that get all the publicity, there is a far greater problem? Does he also agree that money is not always the problem and that how the money is spent and the care that is taken to check what happens is sometimes more important? In fact, local councillors are in a better position than any civil servant or Minister to check that children get a better deal in future than, frankly, we have given them for many years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share and accept those comments, as far as they go. I am not making the partisan point that all the problems are the fault of local councillors. Clearly, money is not the only problem. In some instances, councillors fail to account for what is done, but the problems relate not to any particular political party but to the morale of local government and the fact that it has been given less and less responsibility over the years. We hope that the morale of local government improves. Although they come late in the Parliament, the new resources will mean that local government has the power and the resources to do more.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0236">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
We fully support the quality protects initiative; it is much needed. Children have not been well served under the current system; they are not a vocal group, such as parents, who can be vocal about education authorities. Often there is a bidding war beween teachers, who can wheel out their children in front of county halls and call for more resources, and social services departments, none of whose clients lobby because they are not in a position to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the initiative, but we question whether the Government will take account of the difficulty that some authorities face in levering up quality when they are losing their funding. We hope that the Government will take responsibility for the outcome, given that they will approve the plans and the inputs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.7 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Michael Colvin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Romsey)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall make a statement and then ask three quick questions, because my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge has already anticipated most of the questions that arise in most of our minds as a result of reading the document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many Conservative Members always regretted the previous Government's imposition of a cap on local authority spending. We understood why the cap was necessary in the battle against inflation to keep public expenditure down, but it removed the essential element of local authority accountability. I am glad that this is one Conservative policy—there are not many others—that has now borne fruit and is public knowledge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My first question relates to expenditure. The Minister must give us some clarification before we proceed and, I hope, give the measure a fair wind. The £32,500 that is payable to local authorities is said to be a special one-off grant. However, if the projects continue for three years, will the grants be repeated in the two subsequent years? As the first relevant period related to 1 April 1998 to 31 March this year, little time is left in which to spend the grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities must establish management action plans, undertake all the work that that involves and employ a quality protects lead officer, so not much money will be left out of the £32,500 to assist children in need. Presumably, under the initiative, local authorities will identify areas of need and present proposals that will involve much more expenditure. Will that additional expenditure be taken into account in determining the SSA?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other thing that I find extremely mysterious relates to the quality protects regional development worker grant. Which were the other eight local authorities? Why were the City of York, Shropshire and Wiltshire singled out for special treatment?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That leads me to my final point about the blanket approach versus selectivity. My hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge said that the Government should be much more selective and should identify local authorities in which there are known to be shortcomings or a breakdown between the social services departments of councils, local health trusts and the voluntary sector. Those three
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
components must be linked together to achieve proper delivery of the services that we need. Why adopt a blanket approach to local authorities in general for the quality protects grant? Why have the Government been so selective with the worker grant?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.11pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I shall try to deal with hon. Members' general observations about the quality protects programme and, in doing so, try to respond directly to some of the points made by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The quality protects programme has been strongly welcomed by local government, which is working closely with us to achieve the objectives that we have set. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge gave the unfortunate impression, perhaps wrongly, that some resistance has come from local government to the quality protects programme. No resistance exists; local government is a strong partner in taking the work forward. The hon. Gentleman also had some interesting observations about local government autonomy, which I shall discuss in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman expressed anxiety about the use of the word "partnership". Improving standards and quality should mean a partnership between local government and central Government, and as a Government, we have a role in helping to set objectives and providing the necessary resources. We are doing precisely that. However, social services are local services, as we fully understand and respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was surprised to hear some of the hon. Gentleman's comments about local government autonomy and the role of central Government, especially in light of his party's record on such issues when in government. I am rather surprised that he has suddenly become a fan of local democracy, and wonder where he has been for the past 20 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also expressed anxiety about how management action plans might damage frontline services. The plans that we have asked local authorities to develop will be their own local responses to the quality protects initiative, but will obviously have to be set within the framework of the national objectives and priorities that we have established. Management action plans help to improve front-line services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman complained about the delayed issuing of the circular, which was issued only a matter of days after the statement made by the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, my right hon. Friend the Member for Hull, East (Mr. Prescott). I do not believe that that circular could have been distributed any more quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also mixed up his special grant reports. He was worried about the absence of references to satisfactory progress. That will be included in next year's special grant report, which we hope to debate in Committee later this year—in the summer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also referred to the chaos that local government experienced in meeting our time scale for management action plans. That is not a true
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0237">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
representation of what happened this year. It is a misrepresentation to describe the programme as one of chaos. It was not chaos. All local authorities complied with the objectives and timetables that we set, and we are grateful to them for their hard work in allowing that objective to be met.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course local authorities complied with the timetable set by the Secretary of State, because otherwise they would not receive their share of the money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask the Minister to clarify his point about the clarification of the definition of satisfactory progress. Is he saying that the special grant report this time next year will clarify for local authorities what progress they will have to have made in order to be reimbursed for the expenditure that they incur between April 1999 and February 2000?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said, we hope that next year's special grant report will be put before the Committee later this summer. That report will deal with the £75 million to be made available to local authorities in the coming financial year, and it will deal with the questions raised by the hon. Gentleman. That partly answers the points raised by the hon. Member for Romsey (Mr. Colvin), with which I shall deal in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge also asked whether any adjustments had been made to standard spending assessments. No adjustments have been made. He also asked about the future. He will know, I am sure, that my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister announced a moratorium on standard spending assessments for the next three years, so no subsequent changes will be made during that period. He asked why we had increased the grant paid to Rutland county council. The simple answer is that the Department received representations from the county council for money to prepare for management action plans. We listened to those representations, acted upon them, and made further resources available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked a number of obscure questions about the appointment of regional development workers. He implied that there was something improper in the City of York receiving money under the special grant. The City of York is receiving a payment because one of its officers has been appointed as a regional development worker. There is nothing improper or inappropriate about that, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman is satisfied with that assurance. He had some other questions about regional development workers. Only three local authority regional development workers were appointed in time for them to be included in the special grant report that we are debating today. I hope that that deals with the points raised by the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not. The Minister said explicitly that eight regional development workers have now been appointed, yet the report provides for grants to be made to only three authorities—a total
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
sum of £60,000. Will the authorities employing the other five regional development workers receive a grant in respect of the cost of employing them up to 31 March this year?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that those local authorities will be reimbursed next year; however, if the hon. Gentleman will allow me, I shall confirm that in writing. I hope that I have dealt with all the points he made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are grateful to the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) for his support for the quality protects initiative, but he will not be surprised if I do not let him get away with his implication that there is something wrong with this year's local government settlement. It is worth pointing out to the hon. Gentleman—he might relay this to the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, who does not seem to understand it—that the local government financial settlement figures used by the Liberal Democrats exclude all specific grants. Overall, it is one of the most generous settlements for social services in recent years, certainly since the introduction of the council tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures are clear and accurate, and we estimate that an additional £523 million will be going into social services standard spending assessments this year. It is a significant settlement, with significant increases for many local authorities. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will allow me to correct the implication that we are not supporting social services properly. We are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Romsey raised several points, and I have already dealt with his question about regional development workers. He repeated the concerns expressed about the City of York; I hope that I have dealt with that. The £32,500 is a grant allowing local authorities to meet the costs of developing their management action plans; it is the maximum payable under the grant report that we are debating today. Like the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, the hon. Gentleman seems to have mixed up the special grant reports. The specific allocations for the financial year starting in April will be found in the special grant report that we shall debate later in the summer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The £75 million will be allocated for the first of the three years of full operation of the quality protects programme. In December, we provided an indication of the allocations for local authorities; if the hon. Member for Romsey is interested, I can provide him with details of how much his local authority will be allocated under the quality protects programme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
