Draft National Minimum Wage (Offshore Employment) Order 1999</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Dr. Kim Howells)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft National Minimum Wage (Offshore Employment) Order 1999.</p></blockquote>
As ever, Mr. Cook, it is a pleasure to have you presiding over the Committee. I am surprised that you have not been airlifted already.<br><br>
On 3 March, my right hon. Friend the Minister of State for Trade and Industry, presented in Committee two sets of draft regulations that implement the minimum wage. They were passed by the House and will come into force on 1 April. I now present a draft Order in Council, which will extend the provisions of the National Minimum Wage Act 1998—as well as implementing regulations—to people who work offshore.<br><br>
Under the order, British and foreign workers who work or, to follow the strict wording of the order, who "ordinarily" work in the territorial waters of the United Kingdom will qualify for the national minimum wage from 1 May 1999—the date when the order comes into force. The order will apply also to Britain and foreign workers who work in the United Kingdom sector of the continental shelf, where the work is connected with the exploration or exploitation of the sea bed or its subsoil in the United Kingdom sector, or where the work is connected with the exploration or exploitation in a foreign sector of the continental shelf of a cross-boundary petroleum field.<br><br>
In plain language, the order mainly covers work done on oil or gas rigs in exploring for or producing oil and gas. For the sake of completeness, I should make it clear that exploration and production in the United Kingdom sector is not confined to oil and gas reserves. It may include other natural resources, such as coal, which the order also covers.<br><br>
Employers of those workers will be subject to the same obligations as other employers under the National Minimum Wage Act and the National Minimum Wage Regulations 1999. They will be required to pay workers at least the national minimum wage, and to comply with other requirements relating to the calculation of minimum wage pay and hours and the need to keep sufficient records. Such workers will also have the right of access to their relevant records if they believe that they are not receiving the national minimum wage. They will be entitled to bring a claim for failure to pay the national minimum wage before an employment tribunal or other civil court.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
The draft order provides that tribunal claims will be heard before tribunals in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, according to the offshore area where the relevant act or failure to act took place. It does not apply to workers on board ships that are in passage or engaged in fishing or dredging; it does not need to. Workers on board ships are dealt with already by the National Minimum Wage Act. The Act entitles mariners to the national minimum wage if they work on board UK-registered ships, unless their employment is wholly outside the United Kingdom or the person is not ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom.<br><br>
People may ask why it is necessary to extend the Act to offshore oil workers. The oil and gas industry is not normally associated with low pay. Until recently, when the price of crude oil dropped significantly, the industry has usually been described in terms of bonanza, boom and riches. Those who have been employed offshore have generally done very well from the exploitation of North sea oil and gas. That remains true in probably 99 per cent. of all cases.<br><br>
Even in the richest sectors, however, there may be pockets of low pay. Not everyone is an oil or gas engineer or a construction worker. Someone has to do the less well-rewarded jobs, such as cleaning, general maintenance and refurbishing. Indeed, if one believes press reports, the workers who paint North sea rigs are paid as little as 81p an hour. Pay of 81p an hour is unacceptable anywhere in the United Kingdom, whether on the waters of the North sea or on dry land—if such stories are true. It is right that workers should receive the minimum wage regardless of whether they are on dry land or offshore. It is therefore right to extend the provisions of the 1998 Act to offshore employment.<br><br>
The draft order is straightforward. We have heard the arguments of principle about the national minimum wage. The national minimum wage will shortly become a reality for workers on the mainland; it must be right to extend the protection of the Act to offshore workers. I believe that it is logical to do so. It complies with standard practice. It means that the picture surrounding the national minimum wage will be complete from 1 May, when the order comes into force. I commend the order to the Committee.</span></p>
<p>4.35 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Boswell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Daventry)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I first welcome you, Mr. Cook not for the first time, to the Chair of a Committee considering employment matters. I also welcome the Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs, who has not previously debated the matter in such a context. It is always a pleasure to listen to his explanations and, on occasion, to enjoy his beneficial impact on the Welsh rugby team, which is beginning to look up. I do not want to dilate on that. Nor do I wish to re-fight the battles of last year, when Committee members considered the principle of the national minimum wage. Indeed, I concede the logic—in my view it is misplaced—in extending the principle of the national minimum wage to offshore employment. However, an untidiness that is not uncharacteristic of the Department has evinced itself again.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0423">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
The main regulations come into play on 1 April—an appropriate date—but those for offshore workers do not come into force for another month. If it were to be for one, as for the other, one would have expected the dates to coincide, yet that is not so. The Government have had more than a year to consider the implications of section 42 of the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 and its extension, by Order in Council, to offshore employment.<br><br>
On the general principle of the universality of the Act, the Minister's averments have been somewhat dented by the fiasco on au pairs. The Department has had to scramble out from an embarrassing situation, and find a way to exempt au pairs. I find that legally somewhat implausible, and shall return to that in a different context.<br><br>
Unless I have overlooked something, I slightly regret the way in which the order has been thrown at us. I made inquiries at the Vote Office when I received the definitive print of the draft order, but it contains no regulatory impact assessment. Nor, except in the most general terms, has the Minister sought to explain how the order bites.<br><br>
I concur with the Minister, consistent with out debates last year, that the order does not have a heavy impact on what might be termed oil industry production workers. It is more likely to relate to ancillary services, some of which may be poorly paid. However, there appears to be no paper annexed to the document stating how many employees it is estimated will be caught, or what will be the relative difference to their pay and, therefore, the concomitant costs to industry.<br><br>
As the Minister conceded, the North sea industry has been doing relatively badly recently. However, the signs are that oil prices will improve. That may have other implications; if the industry is looking up, the changes that the Minister proposes may take the edge off the sector's profitability, or even prevent its return to profitability. I remind the Minister that, by definition, profitability operates at the margin. The sector has not been doing particularly well; additional burdens, however small, are at the margin, and unwelcome.<br><br>
Having mentioned general points, I turn to the details of the order. It is a pleasure to have the Minister's fresh mind on these matters, although we regret the absence of his right hon. Friend the Minister of State, because of illness.<br><br>
Painful questions must be asked to ensure that we get the measure right. The Minister can perhaps update the Committee after last year's debates, as my first question refers to when part of a rig is in another jurisdiction. I note that yesterday's independent law reports said that where contracts are held will be of interest to lawyers. The inference of the Minister's remarks was that the test of whether an employee falls within the ambit of the national minimum wage is where he works ordinarily or, possibly, where his contract is held. The fact that it has gone for a walk to the other end of the rig, as it were, and straddles two jurisdictions makes no difference to the need to pay the minimum wage at all times. It would be pretty difficult to calculate the figures otherwise.<br><br>
It might be helpful if the Minister could say whether other countries with an adjacent continental shelf extend their national minimum wage arrangements, if they have them. Are there other dovetailing jurisdictions?<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
My second point refers to the inspectorate. During the passage of the National Minimum Wage Act 1998, we debated who would be carrying out inspections? I am not aware of wage inspections taking place, but I am sure that the Minister will have made some arrangements for ensuring enforcement, if such inspections were anything more than a purely fictional exercise. What about the serving of penalty notices, as prescribed in the legislation? When someone goes offshore, it is a little difficult to do that, as workers are not always in one place. Will the Minister enlighten the Committee on whether there are special arrangements for monitoring, which is the role of the inspector, and explain how notices will be served?<br><br>
The issue of the jurisdiction between England, Scotland and Northern Ireland seems, to my lay eye, to be reasonably straightforward, and I shall not press the Minister on it.<br><br>
I have two comments to make about the definition of the application of the order. The Minister mentioned its interaction with maritime activities, such as taking a ship across the continental shelf, or fishing. I am a bit concerned about whether there is a clear functional distinction between dredging in the sense of pipe-laying, and ordinary dredging. It could be a dual-purpose activity or one might be disguised as the other. We could get into some arcane legal wrangles about when a dredger was laying a pipe and when it was merely carrying out dredging operations. That, as they say, was a note that I prepared earlier.<br><br>
A further point arose out of the Minister's remarks, which bears on a subject for which I once had some responsibility. I refer to sea-bed dredging for aggregates, such as sand and gravel. They are definitely winning assets from the sea bed, but that activity is not the normal dredging operation to keep a navigation channel open. I am not sure whether it would be covered under the maritime test or this test, or whether there is a certain awkwardness in the jurisdiction.<br><br>
I have two further points to make, on the order, one of which refers to article 2(4), which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"This Order applies to individuals whether or not they are British subjects, and to bodies corporate whether or not they are incorporated under the law of the United Kingdom".</p></blockquote>
I do not quite understand the third part of article 2(4), under which the order will apply
<br><blockquote><p>"even when the application may affect their activities outside the United Kingdom."</p></blockquote>
Many things that happen outside the United Kingdom affect the activities of companies, even those registered in the United Kingdom. Will the Minister clarify what is envisaged by that rather Delphic pronouncement?<br><br>
A final point of detail relates to the offences procedure. The order apparently contains a filter by which the Secretary of State must approve
<br><blockquote><p>"any proceedings on an offence connected with employment"</p></blockquote>
offshore. I can find no similar filter for employment onshore, where such proceedings are not required to go before the Secretary of State for approval, although his officer might be involved in bringing a prosecution.<br><br>
Will the Minister explain whether that provision is a matter of form or whether a special procedure is required for the Secretary of State to tick off such cases—for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0424">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
example, because they might be regarded as being politically sensitive, because they might involve joint jurisdiction, or because of their offshore nature? I am sure that the Minister would not want to suggest that he wishes to reward his friends offshore, or his former friends offshore. However, as a famous newspaper might say, "We should be told".<br><br>
Those matters struck me as they would—I hope—a reasonable person considering the detail of the order. The Minister must get this draft order right, so he should explain any difference, such as those that I have suggested, between what happens onshore and what happens offshore. He must explain whether those awkward definitional problems about what is, or is not, offshore activity are properly expressed in the order.<br><br>
It will be no secret to the Minister or his hon. Friends that we do not like the concept of a minimum wage. We think that the intrusion of law into the contractual and other relationships between employees and their employers is not helpful. However, given that he is in for a penny—or, more accurately, in for a pound—he might as well be in for the extra penny, as provided by statute, and extend the minimum wage offshore. We shall listen to what the Minister has to say and, indeed, to any other contributions that hon. Members may make, and make our dispositions accordingly at the end of the Committee's deliberations.</span></p>
<p>4.47 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brian Cotter <span class='memberconstituency'>(Weston-super-Mare)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although I am very glad to attend this Committee, I was somewhat concerned when I saw the words "minimum wage", I wondered whether I should bring my sandwiches, having been involved in many long sittings in debating the minimum wage in Committee. However, I am reassured that we can deal with the order fairly briefly.<br><br>
I was encouraged by the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) who, among his hyperbole, seemed to support the idea of the minimum wage, given that he was probing to discover whether it will operate in all offshore areas—at least, I got that impression.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must disabuse, or perhaps reassure, the hon. Gentleman. I was making the point that, although we still oppose the concept of the national minimum wage—I made that clear to the Committee—it is important that it should operate fairly. A person employed in one context should not be paid the minimum wage if it is not available to another person in a related but slightly different context.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cotter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad—perhaps glad is not the word—that the hon. Gentleman has made it clear that the Conservatives still oppose the minimum wage.<br><br>
It was useful of the Minister to draw out the fact that some people in offshore industries might be paid low wages. That possibility seems to defy one's belief about the offshore industry. We all tend to think that people are paid very well in that industry. However, any industry can change over time, and people might consider
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
belt-tightening to be necessary. In that vein, it is important that an order ensures that nothing like that can happen in that, or any, industry. On behalf of the Liberal Democrats, I welcome the order and will support its implementation.</span></p>
<p>4.50 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Tyrie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Chichester)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised that there are workers, particularly in the North sea oil industry, who fall into such a category. When I worked for BP a long time ago, I was offered a job on an oil platform. The main perk was that it was paid at double the normal BP rate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Did my hon. Friend take the job?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tyrie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I did not in the end. Perhaps that was a mistake.<br><br>
I would be interested to know how many workers are in the category, and whether the order will affect a meaningful number—even accepting the "in for a pound, in for a penny extra" point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry. Has the Minister had representations on the order from the oil industry? If he has, what overall increase in the wage bill—assuming no change in the numbers employed—would be involved in exploration and exploitation of the North Sea?<br><br>
Secondly, I seek clarification on what the order covers. It is designed to cover oil platforms operating in the North sea; is it also designed to cover oil rigs engaged in exploratory drilling that may move around on the continental shelf?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to interrupt my hon. Friend's flow, but does he not agree that mobile rigs have two modes of operation: when they are anchored and doing their job and when they are moving between stations? In the latter case, are they described as a ship or as a mobile oil rig in the course of operation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tyrie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes the point that I was seeking to draw out. If there is a clear definition, what is it? The word exploration appears in the explanatory note; I assume that that covers exploratory drilling. Does it also cover exploratory drilling that takes place partly on the continental shelf allocated to the UK and partly in another jurisdiction?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Howells</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There has been much debate about that. To reiterate what I said: in plain language, the order largely covers work done on oil or gas rigs exploring for or producing oil or gas. Is that okay? That is pretty simple.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tyrie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that that does cover the point, because "rig" is a general term. There is often confusion in distinguishing between a rig and a platform. "Rig" is generally used by the wider public to mean platform. Platforms are rooted in the sea bed and do not move, but rigs may be anchored or may move around. Rigs that move around a lot for exploratory drilling have many of the attributes of ships. Are those vessels covered by the order?</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
<p>4.54 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank Doran <span class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to speak. As a Parliamentary Private Secretary, I know that convention is usually against that. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] I hear acclaim from the Opposition Benches.<br><br>
As someone who has had a connection with the oil industry for more than 25 years, who studied petroleum technology at university, and who now has a constituency that is the European capital of the oil industry, I would like to make a short contribution to the debate.<br><br>
Hon. Members have pointed out that the oil industry is not usually associated with low pay. I remind them of the principles frequently enunciated during consideration of the National Minimum Wage Bill in Committee, on which I served with the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Cotter) for many happy hours—through the night on a few occasions. The key principle was that there should be no regional or sectoral opt-outs. I am delighted that the Act is being extended to the offshore oil and gas industry.<br><br>
Hon. Members are right to point out that the industry is generally regarded as a high-paying industry, but it contains serious pockets of low pay. The low-paid workers tend to come not from the United Kingdom but from third world countries, such as the Cape Verde islands or the Philippines. Russian and Polish workers are starting to be introduced, too.<br><br>
At the end of last year, public attention was brought to several incidents of extremely low pay. The Minister mentioned workers being paid as little as 81p an hour. He did not tell the whole story. Those workers worked well beyond the usual shift pattern of UK workers of either two weeks on and two weeks off, or three weeks on and three weeks off. They often worked one month on, one week off—subsequently returning for one month. They worked 16-hour days for that money. They tended to work in low-grade jobs such as stewarding and in catering—in breach of a recognition agreement that is supposed to extend across the entire North sea oil and gas industry in the UK sector. Because of the low standard of catering in better times, the oil industry encouraged catering contractors to enter into a recognition agreement with the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers and the Transport and General Workers Union, which has operated successfully. However, in the areas in which that agreement is ignored, especially in drilling units and other mobile units in the North sea, workers from third world countries have been introduced at low rates of pay. Not every company has been guilty; those that are tend to be employment agencies that employ such workers on contracts, for which turnover is high.<br><br>
It must be remembered that the oil and gas industry has a huge safety problem. Anyone who takes an interest in it will be well aware of the tragic consequences of the Piper Alpha disaster just a few years ago, in which, I believe, you, Mr. Cook, lost at least one constituent. There are major problems of low pay in the industry. It is important to recognise that it is not that we do not want foreign workers but that we do not want exploited foreign workers in the industry.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tyrie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman described such workers as exploited foreign workers. Does he accept that they have chosen to work for that low pay because it benefits them and their families, and that they will lose that employment if the order is approved?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not prepared to accept exploitation, wherever it takes place. It is important to underline that such workers are exploited, not only in their wage rates but in the work that they must do. Many foreign workers work in the offshore industry. My surgery shows that they come from all over the world. It is a dangerous industry, and people need to be trained to a high standard to operate in it. Such untrained workers are a risk to themselves and others. I do not excuse exploitation in such circumstances in any way, shape or form.<br><br>
Employment in the industry has tended to be regarded as localised. The industry is seen either as Norfolk or East Anglia-based or as north-east Scotland or Aberdeen-based. However, a recent survey conducted by the Offshore Contractors' Association found that 380,000 people were employed in the offshore oil and gas industry. Most of those work onshore; about 25,000 work offshore. In that survey, the OCA discovered that, for 220 Members, there are more than 500 such jobs in their constituencies. That is significant. It is a national industry, not merely a Scottish or an East Anglian industry.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Daventry asked about jurisdiction, especially concerning platforms that straddle international boundaries. I know of no such oil platform. Some fields straddle boundaries, but not platforms. We have more than 30 years' experience of civil and criminal jurisdiction in the offshore application of all our laws.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We ae legislating not only for the situation that exists—I concede that the hon. Gentleman has had experience and gives an accurate picture of it—but for the situation that might, for engineering or operational reasons, arise. It is important to get the regime right. We are not trying to create a problem that does not exist; we are trying to anticipate one so that it does not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I add a point, based on a little more of my experience? The likelihood of any major new North sea developments that are separate from existing developments is remote, particularly given the price of oil. If members of the Committee cast their minds back, they will recall that in 1985 the oil price was between $32 and $35 a barrel. In 1986, it dropped to below $9 and was sometimes as low as $8. It went up to around $20 after a long struggle and is now around $12 to $13 a barrel. The industry is in difficulties and constantly suffers cut. We need to be vigilant about it and I welcome the order.</span></p>
<p>5.1 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Soames <span class='memberconstituency'>(Mid-Sussex)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is the first time that I have sat at your feet, Mr. Cook, and I am grateful for the opportunity.<br><br>
I welcome the Minister to the Committee; he brings the natural youth and flair that we appreciated when he was a Back Bencher. It is a pleasure to see him in government and lending tone to such a vulgar occasion.<br><br>

The word rig is not well understood—there is an agricultural definition, which we will ignore for today's purposes. I would like to ask the Minister two questions. First, I agree with the hon. Member for Aberdeen, Central (Mr. Doran) that it is disgraceful if foreign workers are being exploited on a massive scale on North sea rigs. However, as with all such allegations, that needs to be looked at carefully and quantified. I would like confirmation from the Minsiter that people are paid 81p an hour to paint oil rigs; I find that impossible to believe and I should like the details of where and when that happened. Secondly, at what stage does the crossover occur between the legislation that covers an offshore oil rig that is in territorial waters and the legislation that covers an oil rig in its normal state—not working, but anchored in shore? Is that crossover stage dealt with by the normal legislation or by the order?<br><br>
I hope that the order constitutes the last bit of tidying up of the national minimum wage legislation. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry that it is extraordinary that the measures were not thought of before and that Her Majesty should have been troubled by having to make an Order in Council.</span></p>
<p>5.3 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Howells</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to answer all the questions that have been asked, especially by the hon. Member for Daventry, who asked quite a few.<br><br>
I begin with the issue of workers who work on one side of a cross-boundary installation but also do work on the other side. While workers are working in the UK sector, they will qualify for the national minimum wage, no matter where the platform on which they are housed and fed is located. The minimum wage will not apply to workers employed wholly on the Norwegian or Dutch sides of cross-boundary installations. It will apply to offshore workers who ordinarily work on the UK side but who occasionally work in the foreign sector of cross-boundary fields.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Daventry asked about regulatory impact assessment, but my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, Central has already answered that question. When the national minimum wage was first discussed, an overall regulatory impact assessment was done for all areas. My judgment is that not many workers will be affected by the order.<br><br>
On the issue raised by the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex, I obtained the information from a newspaper article, as I am sure other hon. Members did. I am not a man who trusts newspapers, but I refer him to an article in <i>The Observer</i> of 7 February, under the headline:
<br><blockquote><p>"'Slaves' paid 81p an hour on oil rigs".</p></blockquote>
Several companies were mentioned in that article, including Diamond Offshore, an American catering company. That is where my information came from.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has named one company—a catering company—but, by definition, those people must have been working for rig operators, which are substantial, often international, names. Given the remarks
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
of the hon. Member for Aberdeen, Central about understandings within the industry, does not the Minsiter think that, if that was the situation, the rig operators themselves should have taken a certain interst in it, or even covered it within the scope of the agreements?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Howells</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will name a second company—Maersk. I have never really known how to pronounce its name. Apparently, it has been involved in the "slavery", as it is aptly described, of paying 81p an hour.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soames</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister must be extremely careful about what he says. Maersk is a very distinguished, honourable and straightforward company, and a major international operator. It is unlikely that it is either justified or necessary to refer to it in those terms.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Howells</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for reminding me that this is a serious matter, but it is also a serious matter for any human being to hang off the side of a rig painting it, or to work in the bowels of a rig and be paid 81p an hour. The article reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"A spokesman for Diamond Offshore"</p></blockquote>
and Maersk "declined to comment".<br><br>
One of the agencies that lost its contract said that the decision was a disaster for the men and wondered what they would do and how they would feed their families.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doran</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can assist my hon. Friend the Minister. The hon. Member for Mid-Sussex is absolutely right. Maersk is an internationally renowned and honourable company, exactly as are most of the oil operators and their major contractors. One of the major difficulties in the industry is the failure of the companies to ensure that smaller contractors, including those mentioned in the newspaper article, are properly policed. The problem is that, because a specific sum is provided for in the contracts, the catering contractor hires labour at the cheapest possible price and creams off what he or she can from the contract.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Howells</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Daventry wanted to know who would carry out the inspections. As he knows, the Inland Revenue is the enforcement agency. Workers can go to an employment tribunal or complain to the agency, which can carry out visits, as it may do on dry land. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Something is vibrating—it is nothing very exciting. Sorry about that, Mr. Cook.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tyrie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That will look good in <i>Hansard.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Howells</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it will not go in. <i>[Interruption.]</i><br><br>
The hon. Member for Daventry wanted to know who will monitor the role of the inspector and how will he serve notice. The operational arrangements for enforcement will be made under the framework of agreements between the Department of Trade and Industry and the Inland Revenue. It will be for the Inland Revenue to determine how the inspector should act in particular cases. It is not necessarily for the Secretary of State to consent personally; appropriate officials may do so on his behalf. Indeed, I would imagine that he would be hard-pressed to find the time to do so.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
The hon. Member for Daventry also asked whether the order will affect activities outside the Untied Kingdom, referring to article 2(4). The provision merely ensures that someone who ordinarily works on the UK side of a cross-border field is entitled to the national minimum wage for the work that he does in the non-UK part of the field.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, Central said, we are worried about the profitability of the industry. It is a very big employer and a great source of wealth for this country. Neither I nor anyone else in the Room believes for one moment that raising wages from the level of, for example 81p an hour will make or break a company, and certainly not some of the biggest companies that operate in the North sea. I understand that a task force—I hate that word—has been set up to investigate all aspects that affect the UK oil industry. It involves people from the operating sector and all the big companies, and gives the industry the maximum opportunity to work out how best to compete in global markets.<br><br>
I welcome the contribution of the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare. The public expect all sectors to provide a decent living for those who work in them, especially one as dangerous as this can be. Hon. Members have referred to disasters and the difficulties of working in the North sea. Whatever job is being done, it warrants at least a minimum wage.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
The hon. Member for Mid-Sussex asked about the crossover from offshore to inshore. The order will apply to work in UK territorial waters inshore as well as to work on the UK continental shelf, which is further offshore.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Boswell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not ask the Minsiter to respond to a detailed point now; he may want to do so in correspondence. He has not mentioned the definition of sea-bed dredging in relation to marine aggregates. It would be helpful if he would clarify that at some stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Howells</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that dredging a ditch to lay a pipeline is another aspect of the work. The work undertaken to exploit oil that lies beneath the North sea has many aspects. I am 100 per cent. sure that workers involved in such operations will be covered by the national minimum wage.<br><br>
The principle of the order must be beyond dispute. It must be right that the same minimum standards apply to workers on rigs in the North sea and elsewhere, to the extent that we can apply our jurisdiction, as apply to workers on the mainland. I commend the order to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft National Minimum Wage (Offshore Employment) Order 1999.</p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Committee rose at thirteen minutes past Five o'clock.</i></p>
