	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the answer will be given when the Minister speaks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Ms Glenda Jackson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Stansted Airport Aircraft Movement Limit (Amendment) Order 1999.</p></blockquote>
Mr. Olner, may I say what a pleasure it is to serve under your civilised chairmanship? I trust that it will help the Committee if I detail why Stansted, alone among United Kingdom airports, is subject to a limit on passenger air transport movements. Following public inquiries into proposals for development at Heathrow and Stansted, the then Government produced in 1985 a White Paper—"Airports Policy"—which set out their response to the inspector's report within a national policy context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The then Government accepted the inspector's recommendation that Stansted airport be granted planning permission to develop to cater for about 15 million passengers, but recognised local concerns about the rate of expansion. The airport was then handling about 500,000 passengers a year. It therefore sought powers enabling a limit to be set on the number of air transport movements in order to control the pace of development at Stansted and to give added assurance to local residents that a balance would be struck between aviation and local interests in the use of airport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
The powers were taken in the Airports Act 1986 to ensure that airport development did not outpace the ability of local road and rail links, housing and commercial development to cope with it. A proposal that use of the proposed power should be linked to environmental concerns was rejected by the House, as it had been by the inquiry inspector, on the ground that there were other more appropriate tools for that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Planning permission was granted in June 1985 with a number of conditions attached. One required phased construction with the first phase restricting the size of the terminal to cater for 7 million to 8 million passengers a year. In 1987, an order came into force accommodating that phase by setting a limit of 78,000 passenger air transport movements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1995, BAA pic applied for an increase in the limit to reflect the fact that 78,000 movements could no longer cater for the passenger throughput envisaged in the first phase of development. In July 1996, the House approved an increase to 120,000 movements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The growth of Stansted means that passenger numbers are approaching the 8 million provided for in phase 1 and air transport movements are close to the current limit. Given the long lead time that major development requires, BAA applied last October for detailed planning permission for phase 2 to develop the airport terminal for about 15 million passengers. At the same time, an application to increase air passenger movements was made. Permission for the phase 2 expansion of the airport was granted in April by Uttlesford district council, leaving the movement limit to be decided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As required by the Airports Act 1986, the Government issued a consultation paper seeking comments on BAA's application in January 1999. More than 130 responses were received from a wide variety of interests. The Government considered those, together with BAA' s case for an increase, and decided to recommend to the House an amending order setting the limit at 185,000 movements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As on previous occasions, central to the Government's considerations was the local infrastructure's capacity to cope with the airport's expansion. Work is continuing to improve road access around the airport. The Highways Agency has recently signed a cost-sharing agreement with BAA for the provision at junction 8 of the M11 of slip roads serving the airport, which should be open by 2003. Improvements will be made this year to junction 8 to help ease existing congestion; they will be jointly funded by the Highways Agency and Stansted airport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The A120 Stansted to Braintree road is part of the targeted programme of improvements, and so now has a clear timetable after being in limbo for so long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government wish to see an increase in the proportion of passengers travelling to airports by public transport. Rail links to Stansted airport have been progressively enhanced. In 1998, hourly rail services were reintroduced to the midlands and all stations to London in addition to the half-hourly dedicated Stansted Skytrain service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0314">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
There is now sufficient capacity to cope with increased passenger numbers. However, the general agreement is that more needs to be done. BAA and Railtrack are developing a business case for the west anglia route modernisation, including the option of running four dedicated trains per hour to Stansted during much of the day, without detriment to local stopping services. Both organisations are confident that a satisfactory business case can be produced by the end of the year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, it is important that the impact of the airport development on local residents should be minimised. Work has been undertaken to that end, and it will continue. There will be a new noise insulation programme to support the new limit; a new night noise regime for Stansted was announced on 10 June.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The environmental effects of the airport's expansion were considered in detail during the public inquiry of the early 1980s, before planning permission was granted. The current phasing out of chapter 2 aircraft means that when Stansted is operating at a passenger throughput level of 15 million, noise contours should be smaller in area than those considered at the time of the inquiry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft amendment order contains two articles. The first determines when the order will come into effect. The second substitutes, from 1 March 2000, the figure of 185,000 movements in article 2 of the Stansted Airport Aircraft Movement Limit Order 1987, as amended in 1996. Article 2 sets an interim limit of 120,000 movements from the time at which the order comes into force until 29 February 2000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new movement limit will provide BAA with sufficient assurance to proceed with the necessary investments in the airport, facilitating investment by airlines and other service providers—including bus and rail companies—and helping the local and regional economy. It is estimated that 6,400 jobs will be created at the airport and 4,000 in the surrounding area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
BAA's plans to bring in workers from areas of high unemployment, such as Harlow, Tottenham and other parts of north-east and east London, are establishing close links with employment-orientated self-help groups and jobcentres. BAA is negotiating with public transport providers to pump-prime the establishment of local bus services for commuters and to keep bus and rail fares down for employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Raising the air transport movement limit to enable the airport to reach the capacity envisaged in its planning permission will help Stansted to establish itself as a major centre for travel between London and domestic and short-haul European destinations. The Government are satisfied that that can be done without overburdening the local infrastructure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I trust that it will be in order for me to respond to the point of order raised by the hon. Member for—I regret to say that his constituency escapes me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes; let me tell the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr. Wells) that the order was laid on 16 June.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
In light of what I have said, I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.39 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaun Woodward 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Witney)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I, too, welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Olner?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister said, the White Paper entitled "Airports Policy" set out a policy of phased expansion for Stansted. It stated that the rate of expansion should be controlled for two crucial reasons: first, because there should be a proper correlation with supporting infrastructure and, secondly, because there should be an appropriate balance between aviation and local interests. It is interesting that some of the representations sent to the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions expressed strong concern about the apparent dramatic jump in the volume of movements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The original permission of 1985 constrained the imposition of additional planning conditions for growth beyond phase 1 up to 15 million passengers per annum. Essex county council stated in its representation that it was desirable that the passenger aircraft movement limit be maintained at a lower level: the council would have preferred a limit of 150,000, to maintain the balance. The Minister has not made it clear why this dramatic shift should take place in one go. Why does she think that that would be the right step to take?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
BAA plc made a number of assumptions when making its case. What was the basis for them? Crucial among them was the aviation industry's assumption about the forecast growth during the coming eight years. Most important, is the Minister entirely confident that it will not exceed 15 million passengers per annum? If it does, what steps will the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions take to reduce the figure to 15 million or fewer?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The aviation industry's forecast proposal for 185,000 PATMs is of course related to certain growth rates. It is interesting that the growth rate in the past five years has been 2.5 per cent, each year, although the projected growth is only 1.5 per cent, each year. May we be told the basis of those assumptions for the downgrading of growth?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It also seems relevant that other assumptions have been made about aircraft that use Stansted airport. Can the Minister say how many Boeing 737 200s, 600s and 800s are currently used at Stansted, and how many will be used in the coming five years? The relevance of my question is clear. At present, the airport uses smaller capacity aircraft. Crucially, the movement to these other planes, which we expect to increase at Stansted, will change the numbers dramatically, according to a press release issued only last week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What led the Minister to conclude that BAA's forecasts are correct? What steps or consultation has she taken independently of BAA to check her assumptions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister rightly raised the issue of public passenger transport to and from the airport. She will know that approximately 33 per cent, of passengers currently use passenger transport to get to and from the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0315">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
airport. However, she has not told us whether she has asked, or intends to ask, BAA to specify modal split targets for either passengers or employees travelling to and from the airport. If that has been done, will she say what those targets will be for the coming 10 years?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, what efforts is the Minister making to draw up and agree to short and long term targets for increasing the proportion of journeys to the airport on public transport? Is it the Minister's intention to link them with the PATM limit? Will the Government demand that BAA say whether the rail services' additional capacity will be reflected in the proportion of air passengers travelling to and from the airport? The Minister says that more needs to be done, and that a business plan is being prepared, but we are being asked to agree to the measure when that business plan is not in the Minister' s hands and before she knows the targets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned the problem of surface access roads; structure plan policy T24(iv) requires proposals for any further development of Stansted, which should be judged against the adequacy of those roads. Is the Minister entirely confident that the road access will not worsen short-term traffic congestion? The Minister said that the new slip road from the Ml 1 would be open in about four years' time. Can she give a guarantee to the people using that road that the measure will not create problems in the next four years? The same applies to the improvements to the A120, and to the interim improvements to the Birchanger roundabout at junction 8.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also mentioned the noise insulation programme. We are all rightly concerned about the crucial issue of noise insulation and environmental damage. Is the Minister happy about BAA's intention to develop a new noise insulation programme? Is she confident that there is an effective noise mitigation scheme, which is separate from the noise insulation programme? The Minister said that people in the area should experience less noise than at the time of the inquiry. The crucial question is whether there is an adequate noise mitigation scheme and, if the order is agreed to, and if the noise level increases, what steps people can take to redress their grievances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order leaves many unanswered questions. Essex county council said that it would have preferred a slower move to such a dramatic increase, and a review of the relevant issues. The questions would thus have been answered before the order was introduced. There is a great deal of merit in what the council said. The application to increase the PATM limit to 185,000 in line with the full phase of expansion to cater for passengers through to 15 million per annum will seem too dramatic and too quick unless the Minister can satisfy the Committee by answering my questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.48 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bob Russell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Colchester)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Minister responds, will she inform the Committee that Essex county council and Uttlesford district council raised objections to the big increase? The two local authorities with detailed knowledge of the environmental impact on
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
their communities expressed their views on the right way forward. It is disappointing that BAA and the Government have not taken account of the opinions of the democratically elected bodies in that part of Essex and opted for the phased increase referred to by the hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Woodward).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister also comment on the composition of the Committee? I am the only Committee member with an Essex constituency. While I have little doubt of the integrity of hon. Members, the voice of Essex is not being represented through the two main parties, which is unfortunate. I shall do my best to represent that part of the county that we are dealing with today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to the improvements to the A120 from Stansted to Braintree. If not today, would she and her Department look soon at the reopening of the railway line that used to run through this area from Braintree to Cambridge? If public money is being found to upgrade the A120 and if we are to have an integrated public transport system, the highway infrastructure and railway infrastructure should also be looked at.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister clarify what she meant by the phrase "night regime"? The noise levels have already been mentioned. I have been around on the Essex scene long enough to know that this airport arrived by stealth over a period of 30 years. I can remember the original Stansted plan coming forward and being rejected. One must hand it to the people in the various Ministries and Governments over those years: they have come back and eventually got just about everything that they wanted from what was originally proposed in the 1960s. The planning inquiry that had the environmental impact took place in the 1980s. I should like to think that, as we move into the next millennium, our environmental thoughts and considerations will be a lot tougher than they were nearly 20 years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The creation of new jobs both at the airport and in the locality obviously cannot be ignored. I am sure that it is a matter which Uttlesford district council and Essex county council took into consideration when they felt that the gradual growth of Stansted airport was acceptable but that huge growth was not. I know that we may be expected to carry out a rubber-stamping exercise, but I would be failing in my duty to the people of Essex and the Uttlesford area in particular if I merely rubber-stamped what I think is an unacceptable environmental proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I therefore enter into the debate about Stansted with a degree of caution. I feel compelled to do so because it is not possible to talk about Heathrow, Gatwick or Stansted in isolation. Stansted acts as a key part of the jigsaw of aviation in the south-east of England and therefore aviation in the United Kingdom, and that has an effect on UK pic.

	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
I venture into the debate with trepidation. There are some important points that can usefully be made. I take as my starting-point lines 2 and 3 of the order which state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the existing runway capacity of Stansted Airport is not fully utilised for a substantial proportion of the time for which its runway is available for take-off or landing of aircraft".</p></blockquote>
That is crucial to all of us who are involved in aviation issues in the south-east.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister confirm that the original estimates of the number of passengers per aircraft are what led to the figures set for the limit? In fact, the number of passengers per aircraft is nothing like as high as the original estimates suggested, so there are fewer passengers and more runway slots than expected. It should not take too much thought to realise why Stansted plays a key part in the jigsaw: Heathrow and Gatwick have a huge problem due to lack of slots, yet here we have spare runway capacity in the south east. Whatever our feelings about local environmental matters, we must inevitably address that key issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is my starting-point. The Minister's starting-point was the limit on the number of air traffic movements at Stansted. She readily admitted that Stansted alone has this sort of control. She properly explained why controls were put in place, referring to the circumstances of road and rail transport. That was the argument of the day. However, the Minister failed to explain—and I should be grateful to hear her response—why the Government felt it necessary to keep any limits on daytime use. I stress that I mean daytime, not totally unrestricted, use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even under this order, Stansted will be the only airport in the south-east with this amount of control. I am not necessarily against that, but the Minister should place on the record why she and the Government believe that Stansted should have it when neither Heathrow nor Gatwick do. That is an inconsistency, which the Minister owes it to the Committee to explain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is to fulfil the other part of Government policy by ensuring adequate capacity to handle the demand in the south east up to 2010, she must cope with that demand without building another runway. If the Minister wants to unite everyone in the south east who has an aviation interest, please let someone come up with a proposal for a new runway. In that case, every one of us would be singing from the same hymn sheet. To avoid building another runway, existing runways must be used to capacity, but as I understand them, the proposals will not ensure that daytime use of Stansted is to capacity. If so, will the Minister confirm and explain that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Something else must happen, but I shall mention it only briefly, Mr. Olner, or else you would promptly rule me out of order. Not only must existing runways at Stansted be used to capacity, but Heathrow's terminal 5 must also be built—the only other way of handling the situation, but I will stop the commercial there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You will now stop it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilshire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that you would say that, Mr. Olner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
I should like to ask the Minister several questions. We started out with 78,000 air traffic movements being allowed and it was assumed that that would produce 8 million passengers. By 1996, we had understood that that was wrong and upped the limit to 120,000 movements, which still produced only 8 million passengers. The order before us refers to 180,000 air traffic movements—a 50 per cent, increase—which, as I understand it, would produce 15 million passengers a year. Am I right? If we pass the order and secure 15 million passengers, am I also right that we will not have exceeded the existing planning permission? Will the Minister confirm that we will not breach the planning permission granted by the appropriate local council in the first instance?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister rightly made some play on the question of public transport facilities. Is it correct that Stansted has the highest percentage of passengers using public transport of any airport in the south east? If so, that demonstrates that what has happened at Stansted is exactly what was intended to happen, and that perhaps we need to be less concerned than we might otherwise have been. The Minister referred to slip roads, junction 8 and the A120 having joint funding, and I am sure that all hon. Members are happy to applaud BAA's commitment to that. However, can she reassure the Committee that in cases where joint funding has been promised there is no question of the Chancellor of the Exchequer deciding that he needs to cut back on something and will therefore not come up with his share of the money? Can we be given an absolute guarantee that there is no doubt whatsoever that the Government's proportion of the money will be forthcoming?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be grateful if the Minister would give us more information about the use that is made of Stansted. It is clear from current route patterns concerning the airlines that are using Stansted and what passengers are doing as they go to and fro that, because of Stansted's catchment area and its size, it does not have any of the advantages that Gatwick and Heathrow have. Therefore it is important to understand Stansted's advantages and to encourage them. Its main advantage is that it is able to offer relatively short haul, low-cost routes. Given the Minister's projections of the number of future passengers, can she tell us what percentage of the passengers currently using Stansted will be interlining when they come in and out of Stansted? Is there any understanding of what will happen if a route structure develops, whereby people come into Stansted as a hub and then go somewhere else? If that happens, all her forecasts will be wrong. Evidence has been submitted to her about the lack of interlining, and she should reassure the Committee about the research that has been done in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must also address the issue of air traffic control. There is nothing about it in the order or press releases from the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, and there was no response to the submissions that were made to her about it. If the order is approved, we will in effect be saying that approximately 50 per cent, more air traffic movements can take place. In a sense, that is entirely a matter for air
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0317">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
traffic control at Stansted. However, those of us who are deeply involved in Heathrow and Gatwick issues, and travel in and out of those airports, are only too familiar with flying round in circles over south-east England ad nauseam because of air traffic control problems. If the Minister intends to introduce 50 per cent, more aircraft to Stansted, it is incumbent on her to tell the Committee what research has been carried out into the ability of air traffic control in south-east England to handle such air traffic movements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bob Russell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman recognise that the most serious recent near misses have taken place over the Clacton corridor in Essex, which I understand is the busiest air corridor in the world?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilshire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that that is so. That underlines my point that the 50 per cent, more aircraft that are being introduced into Stansted will have to use that corridor, in addition to everything else that uses it. Part of the difficulty is all those aircraft going round and round up there. Before we vote, the Minister must reassure us that proper research has been done and that discussions have taken place with National Air Traffic Services to ensure not only that it can handle this extra traffic at Stansted, but that there will be no knock-on effect that results in a tragedy—God forbid—or in more people spending more time flying round over Essex and elsewhere, waiting to land at Heathrow and Gatwick.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have another question for the Minister. From my experience of Heathrow, I know that my constituents see a fundamental difference between daytime inconvenience and night-time aggravation. We have a global figure for a year. It is important to have an absolute assurance that we are not giving permission for more night flights. I should be most grateful for the Minister's confirmation that the order will not increase night flights at Stansted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Minister has spoken about joint finance, it is important to have her assurance that she is entirely satisfied that the public transport system can cope. We have 35 per cent, usage of public transport at present. What research has the Department done to ensure that, with the extra capacity at Stansted, the figure of 35 per cent, will go up rather than down?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have looked at the paperwork on daytime noise and noted the usual points about chapter 2 aircraft, the way in which engines have improved and so on. But the Minister did not, in her introduction, give us full details of the research that has been carried out on existing noise and that which will be carried out on future noise. We have had a general reference to the fact that there will be a new scheme. Before we vote on the order, the Minister should tell us exactly what is proposed, rather than using the throwaway line that it will be all right on the night—or on the day, as the case may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Stansted, along with Gatwick, Luton and Heathrow, plays a key role in the south-east aviation jigsaw. It therefore plays a key role in the future economic situation. Mention has been made of job creation. One of the reasons to support the maximum use of the runway is to maximise the potential for inward investment in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
United Kingdom. That point will probably be mentioned again. However, the Minister has given us no details of the research that has been carried out to provide economic justification for these proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all those reasons, and with a degree of trepidation, because I know how I feel about Heathrow, I believe that before we vote, the Minister should answer all the questions put by my hon. Friend the Member for Witney, the hon. Member for Colchester (Mr. Russell) and, I suspect, all those that will follow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call Mr. Brake, may I say, just for clarity, and in case any other hon. Member wants to stray into debating the composition of the Committee, that that is up to the Committee of Selection? It is the decision of neither the Minister nor myself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.7 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Brake 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carshalton and Wallington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is, of course, a great pleasure to serve under the chairmanship of a fellow member of the Select Committee on the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs. I have a number of brief questions that I should like to put to the Minister and I apologise if the rubber-stamping exercise is taking a little longer than anticipated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, at what point will the Government issue an airport policy? It seems as though decisions such as the increase in aircraft movements at Stansted are being taken on a piecemeal basis, within no coherent regional or national framework.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Government's policy simply to allow further runways and airports to be built or expanded, or to allow an increase in aircraft movement, as at Stansted, to cope with the predicted expansion in demand—in other words, to "predict and provide"—in a way that is no longer acceptable in terms of road building? Or is the Government's policy to put air transport into the climate change equation and start to discuss with the airlines, Railtrack and the train-operating companies the scope for maximising the use of railways for journeys that are currently completed by short-haul flights?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister confirm whether any progress is being made on establishing where aircraft emissions will be taken into account as far as the climate change agenda is concerned?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is straying a little far from the order in front of us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brake</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Olner, for bringing me back to the subject. I am pleased to say that I have completed that little diversion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are key policy questions that are entirely relevant to Stansted, and to which I hope that the Minister will respond—as well as to the more specific Stansted-related questions that my hon. Friend the Member for Colchester has posed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.9 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Olner, may I first say what a pleasure it is to serve on this Committee under your chairmanship, which is always fair and generous. It is a delight to be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0318">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
able to speak, even though I was not selected to be a member of the Committee, despite the fact that I represent a constituency close to the airport—not in Essex but in Hertfordshire, one and a half miles from the airport. Although you have ruled the matter out of order, Mr. Olner—and it is nothing to do with you that this has occurred—it is significant that no hon. Member who is directly affected by the airport, other than the hon. Member for Colchester, whose constituency is about 30 miles away from it, has been selected to serve on the Committee. That is a serious flaw in the Committee's composition, on which I have made representations to the Chairman of the Committee of Selection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That flaw has been exacerbated by the fact that, as the Minister told us, she issued the draft order on 16 June, but she neglected to tell the Member of Parliament most closely connected with Stansted airport: the Chairman of Ways and Means, my right hon. Friend the Member for Saffron Walden (Sir A. Haselhurst). He was informed, as was I, three days after the order was issued—admittedly, with an apology from the Minister for not having informed us before it was issued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We submitted detailed arguments to the Minister as to why the 185,000 limit on PATMs proposed by BAA pic was a guess—and a most generous guess—in its favour. My right hon. Friend the Member for Saffron Walden and I had the distinct impression that whatever BAA pic proposed to the Department, the Department would roll over and allow it to have it regardless. The figures raise some serious issues. The figure of 185,000 PATMs, which we are asked to approve today—and which will no doubt be agreed—is based on a figure of 81 passengers per aircraft movement. That is a decrease on the number of passengers originally forecast to be carried on each passenger movement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The original agreed figure of 78,000 passenger air transport movements was supposed to equate to 8 million passengers per annum. If we were to double that figure to reach 16 million—a generous extra million, because the planning permission covers only 15 million—we would approve only 156,000 passenger air transport movements. That is based on what the Department of Transport said at the time were robust estimates that would not be controverted and could certainly not be considered generous. Yet the figure for the number of passengers has been reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Essex county council has been mentioned. May I add the voice of Hertfordshire? Hertfordshire county council also said that the limit should be increased to 150,000, allowing the Minister to give something to BAA pic—say 156,000, which would have equated with the robust estimates that the Department made previously. We should then have remained in some kind of control. A limit of 185,000 passenger air transport movements may result in an increase in passengers to 20 million per annum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for that large increase is that, until recently, the aircraft using Stansted have been smaller than anticipated, and have been used for operation within the regions of England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland, and for nearby European continental destinations, such as Amsterdam, Paris and Brussels. That was not what it was originally thought would happen. As my hon. Friend the
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
Member for Spelthorne (Mr. Wilshire) said, Stansted was going to relieve some of the pressure on Heathrow by taking much bigger transatlantic aircraft, which carry many more passengers. If the Minister thinks that BAA pic has now given up that ambition, she ought to read its press release on Stansted, which is entitled,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Stansted goes for the long haul".</p></blockquote>
It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Stansted airport has launched a drive to attract long-haul airlines. Therefore it is calling on businesses in the region to support its campaign for new services to destinations in North America and the Far East".</p></blockquote>
If that ambition is realised, it will quickly become apparent to both the Minister and the Committee that the number of passengers per aircraft will be not 81, as BAA has obviously convinced the Minister that it will be, but a much greater figure. I suggest that the assumptions underlying the order are fallacious on those grounds alone. The number of passengers carried on long-haul aircraft will increase that average of 81 to a figure that we can only guess; use of such aircraft could certainly take the number of passengers handled at Stansted airport way above the 15 million passengers per annum for which there is planning permission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will the Minister enforce the planning permission for 15 million passengers per annum when she has already increased the PATMs to 185,000, which will bring the number of passengers coming through Stansted airport to something possibly approaching 20 million? That is an important question, to which I hope that the Minister has a convincing answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Minister said that the reason for the PATMs limit was to make certain that the infrastructure was in place. Let me question some of the assumptions that she made. First, she said that the rail link was sufficient and that there was adequate capacity on the line. Underlying that is the assumption that the trains now operating from Stansted will be doubled in length.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In fact, the railway stations on the route between Stansted and Liverpool Street are not sufficiently long to take passenger trains of that length. The airport has already applied to increase the number of Stansted Express trains from the current two per hour to four. It is already apparent that the fast Stansted Express trains are causing both local trains and faster trains from Bishop's Stortford to Liverpool Street to be slowed down. Moreover, there is no way that one can put four fast passenger services per hour on to that line without first resignalling. The Minister did not mention that. Will she make certain that resignalling from Liverpool Street and Bethnal Green to Stansted airport and beyond will take place? It is essential if she is to get the train paths that she needs. Secondly, it is essential that there is an overtaking line for Stansted Express trains. That means replacing the line between Cheshunt and Broxbourne, which was torn up some years ago, so as to permit the Stansted Express trains to overtake without interfering with local passenger trains. Again, we have no absolute guarantee from the Minister that that line will be put in. I want to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0319">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
hear today whether she has obtained such a guarantee from Railtrack. Without it, there is no doubt that the assumptions underlying the advice that I—and the Minister—have had from BAA plc, that the train paths are there and that the extra numbers can be handled, are as fallacious as those behind the figure of 185,000 PATMs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, there is the question of the Birchanger interchange at junction 8. We warned the Department that putting a service station on that interchange while asking it to take an increase in traffic to Stansted would result in gridlock. It has resulted in gridlock and it is disingenuous of the Minister to suggest that the junction will not be overloaded because of the development of a slip road.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Highways Agency has already put some curiously high-tech traffic lights on the interchange, and it says that they should prevent it from gridlocking. Before those traffic lights were put in place, it took one and a half hours for my hon. Friend the member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) to get through that gridlocked interchange so that he could address a dinner in Bishop's Stortford. The dedicated slip road that the Minister announced has always been planned, but it will not solve the problem. It will take traffic off the northbound carriageway of the Mil, but it will not take it off the southbound carriageway, which also uses the same gridlocked interchange at junction 8.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When Stansted caters for anything like 15 million passengers per annum, there is no doubt that the interchange will be gridlocked and that an additional flyover or interchange will be necessary to get traffic in and out of the airport and on to the new road that we have been told will be constructed. Although the Stansted to Braintree road is in the roads programme, I noticed that the Minister gave no date for when building would start and when it would be finished. I hope that she will provide us with that information because, as my hon. Friend the Member for Spelthorne pointed out, we can be certain that a Government will carry out their promise to build a road only when it is half built. Anyone with experience of local or national government will say that. When will building the road start and when will it be finished, so that it can relieve the traffic going east-west and to the constituency of the hon. Member for Colchester and the east coast ports?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order ignores infrastructural problems, matters of planning permission and local opinion from Saffron Walden and Essex and from Hertford and Bishop's Stortford. The Minister has not discussed the matter with the elected representatives of the people who live and work around the airport. That is disgraceful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must also deal with the question of the enforcement of the planning permission. A hugely generous proposal for 185,000 PATMs has been made, but the Government have no means of enforcing the planning permission. How do they propose to do that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
	<p>5.23 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I move on to the main thrust of my response, I apologise, yet again, to the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford and to other hon. Members for the grievous oversight that meant that the letters informing them of the decision were not delivered until after the press notice had been released. I apologise sincerely for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What was particularly interesting in the contributions of the hon. Members for Witney, for Spelthorne and for Hertford and Stortford was their total inability to remember that initial planning permission for the phased introduction of an increase in passengers and air transport movements at Stansted was passed in 1985 when a Conservative Government were in power. The issue was last debated in the House in 1996—again when a Conservative Government were in power. Permission was granted by the House to increase air transport movements to 120,000. The hon. Member for Spelthorne is inaccurate when he talks about the order virtually doubling the number of air transport movements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilshire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to the hon. Lady for giving way and for trying to deflect criticism back this way. Had she done her homework she would have discovered that when this was put before the House in 1985 I was not an MP, so I could not have contributed. From 1987 until today, everything that I have said to question or criticise her, I have also said to whichever Minister was in office, irrespective of their party. If she had done some homework, she would know that it is rubbish to suggest that people like me supported what went on before and asked no questions, but criticise her now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I was criticising was the apparent thrust of the arguments advanced this afternoon, which is that the order has come from nowhere. It is part and parcel of the initial agreement on Stansted which was initially granted in 1985. The concerns expressed by Conservative Members about the infrastructure did not seem to figure in 1996, when the House last debated the increase of passenger movement and air traffic movements at Stansted and the order was increased to 120,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the present Government who have guaranteed that improvements to junction 8 are on-going as we speak. They are expected to be completed by the end of the year. The finance has been found for the slip roads that are particularly important not only for local residents but for the airport. There was no commitment to any such funding in 1996. There was no commitment by the previous Government to bring about the vital infrastructure improvements. The issue of local residents' lives being affected by airports, the point made somewhat obliquely by the hon. Member for Spelthorne, is central to the Government's considerations of anything to do with airports and aviation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodward</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear the hon. Lady's comments, but her Government say that they believe in local choice. Clearly, the views being expressed by county councils such as Essex and others, as explained this afternoon, are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0320">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
strongly against that dramatic shift. What was the response from Essex county council when the last increase was made in July 1996? Was it for or against the raising of the threshold?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give the hon. Gentleman that information now, but I shall do so later. Our consultation elicited 134 responses and they represented a wide range of interest groups. This Government's ethical approach to all consultation exercises is that all responses will be carefully considered before any decision is taken. We are obliged by statute to consult organisations including airlines, airports and county, district and borough councils. We received responses from 13 local authorities, 21 airlines and six others: 52 per cent. supported the request to increase the limit to the full amount. I understand the concerns expressed by local residents what they perceive as an intrusion in their lives, but precisely those considerations have made Stansted the only airport where this type of phased development is written into statute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodward</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady. I am sure that she looked at the representations that her office received. Of those county councils that were consulted, how many supported the raising of the threshold?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have a precise breakdown for that category. However, I shall, of course, furnish the hon. Gentleman with such details.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked for figures in relation to a range of Boeing aircraft. Once again, I do not have those details to hand, but I shall provide him with them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may be able to help the Minister with the breakdown of those consulted. Essex and Hertfordshire county councils opposed the increase to 185,000 and suggested a figure of 150,000. Uttlesford district council did the same, as did East Hertfordshire district council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the district councils that were in favour of the increase serve areas that are much further from the airport than those served by Uttlesford and East Hertfordshire district councils and, indeed, those served by my right hon. Friend the Member for Saffron Walden and myself. That is because such councils are seeking to gain employment opportunities—including opportunities to work at the airport—for those living in towns such as Braintree, Harlow and Stevenage. People in those towns do not have to put up with the noise, inconvenience, serious disturbance and expansion experienced by those in towns such as Bishop's Stortford.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is a terribly long intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Olner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing an airport that is part of the national infrastructure. It is part and parcel of BAA's policy to attract workers from an infinitely wider area than that touched on by the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford. It is only right and proper that the employment potential should be spread as far as BAA is proposing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
Central to the Government's thinking is the need to achieve a balance between sustainable development—whether national, regional or local—and environmental considerations, whatever the transport mode. However, let me repeat that the phased development of Stansted was central and essential to permission being given. I understand arguments about increasing the limit to 150,000. However, that figure was insufficient in relation to the expansion of the terminal for which planning permission has been given and which is cost-effective and the least disturbing option for the airport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some hon. Members expressed concerns that the granting of the order would be the thin end of the wedge and that there would be an increase in excess of the 15 million passengers per annum given in the original order. They argued ferociously for local authorities. However, they have little respect for the power of those authorities, as it is impossible to increase movement without the requisite planning permission being given. Certainly, local authorities have power to ensure that the limit of 15 million is not broken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Colchester and for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Brake) were among those who expressed anxiety about surface access to the airport. As part of our approach to transport, especially integrated transport, we have said repeatedly that such access is a major consideration in any proposal to develop any airport.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister moves on to surface transport, I must intervene, as I cannot let her get away with the statement that a local district council has the power to prevent the expansion beyond 15 million passengers per annum.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is again making a statement, not an intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will abide by your very fair ruling, Mr. Olner, but may I put it in the form of a question? How would Uttlesford district council prevent the expansion of the airport beyond 15 million passengers, given the mechanism by which that would be effected and the fact that the order allows an increase?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I used the phrase "district council". I talked about the powers of local authorities. They do have such powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What powers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a document before me which I have no intention of reading to the hon. Gentleman. I will send him a copy. The document relates to how local authorities enforce planning control. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford shakes his head and says from a sedentary position that it cannot be done. Not only can it be done, it will be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodward</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we are being asked to consider the order, not merely rubber-stamp it, it is incumbent on the Minister to outline briefly the powers that local

	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
authorities have, and it is proper for the Committee, having raised a legitimate worry about the airport exceeding 15 million passengers, to ask the Minister to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The order is part of the initial order from 1985 which relates to the phased development of Stansted airport. The concerns about excessive growth expressed this afternoon were expressed at the time that Stansted airport was built. The hon. Member for Spelthorne represents a constituency close to Heathrow. He seemed to argue for greater expansion at Stansted to relieve congestion at Heathrow while also appearing to argue against it. Heathrow did not have that safeguard. Today's order is part of an original order: it is only the latter for which relevant planning permission—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodward</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> rose—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I have not finished. Only the latter order received relevant planning permission. If there is an attempt to breach the original order from 1985, local authorities may enforce certain powers. There is no authorisation for exceeding the limits, which relate to 15 million passengers per annum and 185,000 air transport movements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodward</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Lady tell the Committee of a single power that is vested in local authorities? If she cannot, why does she not say so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A local authority can turn down an appeal, or a plan.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has been agreed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are squeaks from a sedentary position from the hon. Member for Beckenham (Mrs Lait) and from the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford came the phrase, "It has been agreed." I say for more than the third time that what was agreed was an expansion of passengers at Stansted airport to 15 million per annum and air transport movements of 185,000 per annum. No permission has been given for an increase in either figure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodward</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I repeat that it is clear that the Minister either does not wish to give the Committee the answer or does not know the answer to the crucial question, what can a local authority do if the 15 million is exceeded? It is all very well for the hon. Lady to answer as she did, but the important issue is what a local authority would do if the 15 million figure was exceeded. What is the process to which she referred?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The process for expansion is in the order that was first granted in 1985.1 shall be happy to send the hon. Member for Witney a copy of "Enforcing Planning Control", which is much too long for me to read to the Committee. If the hon. Gentleman is labouring under the delusion that nothing can be done, let me reassure him that local authorities' powers in these matters are very strong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilshire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to the hon. Lady for offering to send me a copy of the document. But I chaired the planning committee of Wansdyke council and I suggest to her that she is addressing the wrong issue by
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
offering my hon. Friend a piece of paper stating what the powers of the local authority are. What any hon. Member who has been involved in local government wants to know, given the piece of paper and the powers, is what condition in the planning permission will be breached? Against which condition will the powers that she refers to be invoked? Will she read out the condition in the planning permission that will be breached? What exactly is it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Olner. No, I cannot read out the relevant paragraph to the hon. Member for Spelthorne, but I shall be happy to send him the document. I repeat, it is extraordinary that hon. Members who argued for local authorities to be considered believe that their powers are so negligible. We considered the responses of local authorities to an order which the initial granting made abundantly clear limited the expansion of Stansted airport by limiting the number of passengers that it could handle per annum to 15 million and the number of air transport movements to 185,000. It is extraordinary that hon. Members who argued for local authorities to be considered believe that their powers are so negligible; I find it somewhat bemusing. It may well be that their experience stems from life under Conservative Governments when local authorities' powers in respect of planning permissions were mostly rubber-stamped by the then Secretary of State. That will not be the case under this Government, which leads me to—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Jacqui Lait 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beckenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I just finish my point? That leads me to a matter that was raised by the hon. Members for Spelthorne and for Carshalton and Wallington, which in effect concerns Government policy on aviation interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised that the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington, as a member of the Select Committee on the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs, was not aware of the Government's policy on aviation, which has been announced. We announced that there would be regional airport studies and studies into airports in the east and south east of England. We have said that we will publish a White Paper on aviation and that the studies will be part and parcel of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brake</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for giving way. Surely she must agree that studies and White Papers do not amount to a policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not surprise me that a Liberal Democrat would make a policy without any kind of study, which is the wrong way round. We have made it abundantly clear that our approach to transport, whatever the mode, is long term. We are committed to sustainable development and the protection and improvement of the environment, and are particularly anxious to achieve a balance in matters to do with airports and aviation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0322">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. Before she develops her policy, I want to take her back to the practicalities of local authority powers, about which the Minister will send us details. Will she tell us, too, whether BAA plc, for example, will have the power to appeal to the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if it does not agree with what the local authorities decide?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There have always been powers for appeal to the Secretary of State in such matters, but as I said earlier to the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington, the Government are committed to sustainable development, balancing environmental considerations and the creation of a properly integrated public transport system. That is clearly long term, but it is something that 18 years of Conservative Governments significantly failed to do, as I regret to have to point out to the hon. Member for Beckenham.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As someone who lives near Luton and Birmingham International airports, I ask the Minister to confirm that if at any stage there are proposals to exceed the movement limit there will have to be an application to change it. If any Opposition Member is worried about extra flights at Stansted, we would be pleased to have those flights at Birmingham International.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for putting so succinctly what I tried and failed three times to express in my response to Opposition Members' concerns about the flouting of an initial order that contained within it a phased development of and a limit to passenger and air transport movements at Stansted airport.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brake</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister moves away from the question of environmental sustainability, will she simply confirm whether it is Government policy to predict and provide for airports?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can say categorically once again to the hon. Gentleman that that is not our approach to any transport mode. I am amazed, as I said before, that a member of the Environment Sub-Committee of the Select Committee on the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs should be so uninterested in environmental considerations and that the hon. Gentleman has not made it his business to read the Government's policies—and how they will affect particular areas—in detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked about aircraft emissions. I understand that aircraft emissions constitute 2 to 3 per cent. of global pollution. In terms of adding to air pollution, that is infinitely less in comparison with road emissions—as a result of the failure of the previous Administration. It remains our policy that aviation should pay. It is anomalous that aviation fuel is the only transport fuel that is not taxed. However, it would not be possible to bring about the necessary benefits by acting unilaterally, which is why we are pursuing the policy in an international context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two issues have been raised consistently by hon. Members' contributions this afternoon. The first has to do with surface access to the airport. I have already mentioned that the road works are likely to be completed by the end of the year and the slip roads by 2003.
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
Secondly, concerns were raised about the possibility of increasing the capacity of the rail link to the airport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford asked about signalling, the expansion of platforms and—	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order, hon. Members asked questions of the Minister: the Minister is replying and hon. Members should listen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Olner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I was saying, the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford was worried about whether the business plan currently being discussed by BAA and Railtrack will contain the track, signalling and platform improvements to which he referred. I understand that that is part of Railtrack's proposals to improve the whole of this particular line. It has been made abundantly clear to me—by representations from hon. Members and others—that there would be no advantage in prioritising the airport while diminishing rail services for local people. The Government would not be happy with that and the hon. Gentleman will be aware that we want even greater usage of our railways and other public transport infrastructures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Witney asked whether we had a breakdown of public transport usage. It is BAA's aim to increase the percentage of passengers travelling to Stansted by public transport from the current 33 per cent, to 35 per cent, by 2000. That might seem a slight increase, but in view of the total numbers passing through the airport we are talking about a doubling of the number of passengers using public transport to access Stansted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Around 14 per cent, of passengers arrive by bus. Airport coach and bus facilities are designed to accommodate more than 70 coaches at any one time. In 1996, an average of 10 coaches per hour generated 640,000 passengers. If the infrastructure were fully utilised, that suggests a capacity of 8 million coach passengers per annum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodward</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady explain the basis of those figures and say whether any independent research has been conducted to substantiate them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly try to find out whether that information is available. However, it is a bit bemusing that the hon. Gentleman seems to be suspicious of the figures presented by BAA. I repeat: the order was part of an original agreement made in 1985 by the then Conservative Government for the phased expansion of Stansted. The issue was discussed again in 1996—under a Conservative Government—when it was agreed to increase passenger movements to 120,000. It is surprising that hon. members in the Conservative party, which once claimed to speak for British business and to be its friend, have based their questions on a deep suspicion of BAA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodward</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0323">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No; I wish to finish my point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a target to increase the percentage of passengers using public transport. It is estimated that, in 2000, about 8.6 million passengers will use Stansted. About 20 per cent, of passengers arrive at the airport by rail, and I have already touched on the points made by the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford. He was concerned that, although the airport currently has excess capacity, future expansion could impact on local people. As I said, BAA and Railtrack are developing a business case. Although the commitment of Her Majesty's Treasury to provide money was questioned, that money is available as part of our targeted programme of improvements. That is in marked contrast to the previous Government who, in 1996, allowed for expansion at Stansted but did nothing to fund the infrastructure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodward</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is terribly important for the Minister to recognise that Conservative Members do not for one moment question BAA, which we have fully supported. We are questioning the Government's figures. It is worth reminding the Committee that BAA is reported as stating
	<br><blockquote><p>"that there are 	<i>'inherent uncertainties'</i> (paragraph 51.) involved in predicting data of this nature. Paragraph 51 also contains reference to the fact that BAA have deliberately over estimated the number of PATMs required to meet the 15 MPPA mark. They state that the PATM limit proposed has a 50 per cent, chance of being correct, and likewise, being wrong."</p></blockquote>
Unless independent research is conducted for the Government, how can they be sure of the figures that they have used to enable the order to go through?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree, as do BAA and other people who know about aviation and airports, that it is difficult to predict future trends in a volatile market. However, if the hon. Gentleman is suggesting that we should be suspicious of every set of figures—and the figures for public transport usage by passengers going to Stansted come from BAA—it can only be that one mistrusts the business venture involved. It is surprising that an hon. Member from the Conservative party, which has always claimed for itself the endorsement of British business, should tell the Committee that he does not believe the figures presented to us by BAA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All those who have spoken have expressed concern about service access to Stansted. Noise was another issue raised, and that was a central concern of local residents when the initial order for the development of Stansted was introduced in 1985. Noise is of increasing concern to us all. The Government are fully cognisant of the problem, especially around airports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The commitments to noise reduction made in 1985 have been met. The hon. Member for Witney was somewhat simplistic to dismiss the idea of chapter 2 aircraft coming in. The aircraft industry has attempted to meet the environmental concerns that it hears about from all over the world, which is why there has been an improvement in aircraft engines, and why the noisiest aeroplanes will be phased out. When air transport movements increase, the airport noise contour will be smaller than at the time of the initial inquiry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister confirm for the benefit of residents near the airport that the noise-preferential routes that are already being laid down with great care will be strictly adhered to when the airport is expanded? The Minister will realise that although chapter 2 aircraft are being phased out, the order will vastly increase the number of aircraft going overhead.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The present percentage of aircraft flying into Stansted that do not veer from noise-preferential routes is 94 per cent. That is very good, but not good enough. The Government announced in the White Paper, "Airports Policy", that we would consult about noise amelioration issues for all our airports. At present, straying from a noise-preferential route does not carry a penalty. There are penalties for take-off and landing if the engine noise exceeds a certain number of decibels. I will not take the Committee's time to explain a highly technical matter on which I admit that I am no expert. We are concerned that local authorities are not at present able to introduce noise amelioration measures. Also, it would be part of our approach to attempt to reduce the noise climate around airports and to consider imposing penalties for aircraft that strayed from a noise-preferential route. But I have to say to the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford that that would require legislation, as our announcement made clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister confirm that the Government are not proposing changes to the noise-preferential routes themselves?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, we are not. There is a proposal to change the routes and a proposal to improve. Straying from the routes at Stansted is a minor part of their transport movements but there can be improvement there, as at all airports. We shall consult about these issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Concern was expressed about whether the noise insulation programme to which BAA is committed would expand to take up the increased air transport movements. I see no reason to doubt the BAA's commitment. It has significantly not failed to keep the commitment in the past. It would be extremely foolish of BAA to attempt to avoid its responsibilities here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodward</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for generously giving way once again. The question was not about a noise insulation programme but whether there was a noise mitigation scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said, we are looking at the possibility of making noise mitigation schemes a requirement for all airports. There are such schemes at Stansted; they were part and parcel of the original agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have also pointed out that quieter aircraft will come on stream so that, by the time that the airport has reached its full capacity as regards air transport movements, the noise pattern around Stansted will be smaller than when the initial public inquiry into Stansted's proposed expansion was held in 1985.
