	<time>Monday 1 March 1999</time>
	<p>[MR. JOHN BUTTERHLL 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='legislation'>Draft Scottish Parliament (Elections etc.) Order 1999</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Home Affairs and Devolution, Scottish Office (Mr. Henry McLeish)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the Committee has considered the draft Scottish Parliament (Elections etc.) Order 1999.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the draft Scottish Parliament (Disqualification) Order 1999 and the draft Scottish Parliament (First Ordinary General Election and First Meeting) Order 1999.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to present the three orders to the Committee. The orders mark a significant stage in the preparation for elections to and the first meeting of the Scottish Parliament. The order relating to the general election and first meeting is made under section 2(1) of the Scotland Act 1998; it sets the date for the first election to the Scottish Parliament as 6 May this year. It also lays down that the first meeting of the Parliament will take place on 12 May at 9.30 am in the General Assembly Hall of the Church of Scotland on The Mound in Edinburgh.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Norman A. Godman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenock and Inverclyde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to intervene so early. Constituents have suggested that election day should be a public holiday. What is the Government's view?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That subject goes slightly wider than the scope of the orders. Suffice it to say that there will be sufficient celebration in Scotland at the opening: a public holiday might create further difficulty. I hope that celebrations will ensue, but I do not think that there is a need for a public holiday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the order to which I just referred sets the day of the first election, the Scottish Parliament (Elections etc.) Order 1999 makes detailed provisions for the conduct of elections to the Parliament. It also makes provision for the special arrangements that will be necessary when the elections to the Parliament are combined with local government elections, as will happen on 6 May this year. Section 12(1) of the 1998 Act, whose provisions for elections were the subject of our lengthy debates during its passage through the House provides for the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before talking a little more about the elections order, I should like to record our thanks to the representatives of the political parties and electoral administrators whom we have consulted during the past few months. I am aware
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
that, because of such a broad spectrum of opinion, it has not always been possible to please everyone with every aspect of the arrangements, but I am confident that what we have will provide a sound basis for the arrangements for future elections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order reflects to a great extent existing United Kingdom electoral law under representation of the people legislation. We have not tried to reinvent the wheel.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister tell the Committee when the working party last met?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have that information to hand, but I shall endeavour to obtain it, and give it to the hon. Gentleman later in the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was saying that much of the content of the order reflects UK electoral law. Electoral law is sometimes criticised for being arcane, and hon. Members might be aware that a wide-ranging review of electoral practices is currently being undertaken by a working group under the chairmanship of my hon. Friend the Minister responsible for deregulation, drugs and elections—an interesting combination of portfolios. In time, no doubt the recommendations from the review will apply to elections to the Scottish Parliament as they do to the rest of the United Kingdom. But that is not our business today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Bercow 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Buckingham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So that we may be clear about which Minister the hon. Gentleman referred to, will he confirm that he referred to the right hon. Member for Copeland (Dr. Cunningham)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the original question is no.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What does that mean?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is my hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East (Mr. Howarth), who has a fairly interesting workload day in, day out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Modifications to existing practices have been necessary to take account of the additional member electoral system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order takes account of the Registration of Political Parties Act 1998, which allows the use of official party emblems on ballot papers, and controls the names that parties may use at elections so as to reduce confusion. The order also takes account of the recommendations made by the committee on Standards in Public Life chaired by Lord Neill. Those recommendations concern expenses that may be incurred by political parties during an election campaign, and I shall speak about those in more detail later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like briefly to explain the provision that the order makes for detailed election arrangements and the changes that have been made to current practices. Earlier, I mentioned that we have taken into account the Neill committee's proposals on expenses to the extent allowed by powers under the Scotland Act 1998. The order imposes expense limits and penalties for constituency candidates on the same basis as applies to Westminster
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0081">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
elections. The order imposes limits on expenses for individuals who are standing as independent candidates in the regional ballots. Those limits will be structured in a similar way to those imposed on constituency candidates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The limits for an individual candidate are the aggregate of the constituency limits in the region. The order sets a limit of £1.5 million on party expenditure in an election. That limit is intended to cover all a party's campaign expenditure, which is not normally incurred in relation to a particular constituency candidate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having read the draft order, I should be grateful for clarification on the following matter. When someone is standing for a constituency and a regional seat, can the relevant expenditure be claimed for both candidacies?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is no. Each constituency candidate will have an election agent, and a process will be undergone similar to that for candidates standing in Westminster elections. The £1.5 million limit set by the parties applies to the system that lists candidates' names. An entry must be given, not for each candidate, but by a person appointed to deal with the list system. So the two are quite distinct and separate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the voluntary agreement reached by the main political parties in Scotland on the national limit on party expenditure and on some other matters covered by Lord Neill's committee, for which the order does not make provision. However, there have been some objections to the absence of limits at a regional level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord Neill did not propose to make any attempt to sub-divide party expenditure into national and regional elements. However, the form of return proposed for expenses will show separately the expenses incurred by each regional election agent. Transparency is as effective a safeguard as we need against parties targeting expenditure on a particular region.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Letwin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question asked by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) made me realise that I do not understand something in the order. What are the rules on the election expenses of a candidate who is, so to speak, a party soul for the region and who is also standing in a particular constituency? Is it an additive rule?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Similar procedures to those adopted for Westminster elections will prevail for a candidate who stands in a constituency as an individual. There should be no problem about election expenses limits, as they will be dealt with by election agents. However, if—as the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) suggests—a candidate is on the regional list system, the constituency expenditure is separate for accounting purposes. Anything else that is spent, is spent by the national party up to a level of £1.5 million. That covers—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What if it is an individual?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: An individual outwith the party system will have a person providing election expenses for him or her, and will be dealt with in a similar way to a constituency candidate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If such an individual should be a candidate in a regional list and in a constituency, will he or she add £90,000 to £60,000, or whatever the figure may be?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. We are discussing individuals who may be on constituency lists and party lists. We are also discussing people who are on constituency lists as individuals and independents. Such people will have to make a return under the constituency system, but I think that they will have to make a separate return as part of the regional list. I shall clarify that shortly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Anyone who is on the party list can be promoted in that list by his party, even though he is also a first-past-the-post candidate somewhere within the region. Obviously, we are anxious that the £1.5 million may be used to back a candidate in one area if a party feels that it is the only area in which it stands any chance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Neill committee considered the issue and decided against making any recommendations, so parties can spend up to a national limit on expenditure of £1.5 million. However, in the spirit of the voluntary agreement in Scotland, I sincerely hope that any party that wishes to spend that amount will be aware of the transparency of the returns of expenses. It may be an incentive for any political party—if it could afford to do so, which I doubt—to target all or a substantial part of that amount on one area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his explanation, although I may have failed to grasp one aspect of it. Am I right in thinking that people who are on the list, but are not constituency candidates— every party has a number of them—will have their expenses lumped into the national figure of £1.5 million? How will their expenses be vouched for? If expenditure is incurred on behalf of a significant list individual who is not a candidate in a constituency, how will it be vouched for as part of the £1.5 million? There seem to be all sorts of opportunities for losing expenditures. Will the Minister please clarify the matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Part of the remit of the committee in Scotland headed by Professor King is to look at the details of the new system and to get procedures adopted on which all the parties agree. In that sense, the committee is breaking new ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To clarify, for all regional list candidates all expenses are submitted as part of national accounts, including expenses set against each of the regional lists. These will go down as national accounts. Anyone who stands on his own as an individual candidate at regional level has an expenses limit that is equal to the sum of the limits for the constituencies in that region. If he is also a constituency candidate he will have a constituency limit applied to his canvassing and campaigns in the constituency. The two limits will apply to that individual. It is a complex subject but I think that that answers the questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the voluntary agreement reached by the main political parties in Scotland on the national limit on party expenditure and on some other matters covered by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0082">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
Lord Neill's committee. Lord Neill did not propose any attempt to sub-divide party expenditure into national and regional elements, which we have already discussed. The form of return proposed for these expenses will, however, show separately the expenses incurred by each regional election agent. Transparency is as effective a safeguard as we need against parties targetting expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will note that for the elections to the Scottish Parliament we have not applied section 93 of the Representation of the People Act 1983. That provision restricts the way in which broadcasters may cover elections, in particular by making the agreement of all candidates necessary to certain types of report. In this we are in line with the approach proposed in Wales, and indeed which was taken at the elections for the Northern Ireland Assembly. The Home Office is consulting the political parties about the possibility of disapplying section 93 at future elections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rules, which set out all the practical arrangements for the election, are contained in schedule 2 of the order. These rules cover the key electoral process from the publication of the notice of election, through the submission of nominations, polling procedures, the count, the announcement of result and the disposal of documents. The rules also cover the ballot papers. Rule 28 specifies that the colour of ballot papers must be different. For the elections on 6 May we have guided returning officers that the ballot paper for the constituency candidates will be purple and the regional ballot paper will be peach. The ballot paper for local government elections will be white, as is normal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rules make provision for a poster to appear within each polling station, which will provide additional guidance for electors on the procedure for voting. The rules set the text and we are working on a design which will be recommended to returning officers. Honourable Members will also know that we have started a detailed publicity campaign, which has been agreed by political parties from all sides, that will inform voters what to expect when they enter polling stations and what the ballot papers will look like.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The voting procedure at the elections will be very similar to that at present. On each ballot paper the elector will be asked to place an X against their preferred choice. The ballot paper will then be placed in die respective ballot box. There will be three ballot boxes at each station—one for me constituency election, one for the regional Member papers and one for the local government elections. Returning officers have received guidance that the ballot boxes should be colour coded to help avoid any confusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The timing of the count of the Scottish Parliament elections will begin as soon as is practicable after the polls have shut at 10 pm. That will, we have every reason to hope, mean that an overnight count will enable the results to be known during the course of the night. The count for the local government elections will be delayed until the following day and the legislation provides that the counting should not start before 10 am the following day. That will give discretion to the local returning officer to set die exact time in light of local circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
Honourable Members will appreciate that, given the size of the order, a great deal of further detail could be mentioned on which I would be happy to comment further if asked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arrangements that we have put in place are sensible and will work. Elections are always very complex matters. This order, however, should prove to be a sound basis for all the elections to come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As part of this debate about elections, we are also considering an order under section 15 of me Scotland Act 1988, which disqualifies a number of office-holders from membership of the Scottish Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government intend that me Scottish Parliament should represent the widest possible range of interests in Scotland, and it might be helpful to set this order in context if I briefly explained who will be eligible to be a Member of the Scottish Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In essence, those who are eligible to be Members of this House will also be able to be MSPs. In addition, ordained members or ministers of any religious denomination, Commonwealth and Irish Republic citizens as well as EU citizens resident in the UK will be able to stand.

However much it would be inappropriate for certain office-holders to be Members of this House, so would it be inappropriate for certain office-holders to be Members of me Scottish Parliament. Section 15 of the Scotland Act 1998 makes provision about who should be disqualified from membership of the Parliament. Such people include civil servants, members of the armed forces, members of police forces and judges. That covers about 1 million people.

Section 15 also gives Her Majesty power, by Order in Council, to specify office-holders who should be disqualified from being Members of the Parliament. One of the orders that we are debating today deals with mat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Stewart 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Inverness, East, Nairn and Lochaber)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will be aware of my interest in so-called politically sensitive posts—people employed in local government who earn more than £26,000 a year. I have already written to the Minister several times and he has been helpful in his replies. At present, employees earning more than that amount are not allowed to stand for our Parliament or for the European Parliament, and I understand that the Government are considering an Order in Council to enact a level of salary that will disqualify local government members from standing for the Scottish Parliament. Can the Minister clarify what that amount will be?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the current elections, an order will be processed that specifies exactly the same basis that exists now. Discussions in me Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and the Scottish Office about the limit appropriate for the Scottish Parliament election on 6 May have established that the same £26,000—limit will apply. The debate will continue, as strong feelings exist in local government about the failure to adjust that limit. My hon. Friend the Member for Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber (Mr. Stewart) has developed significant representations on that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am thinking of questions that people might be asking. Different-coloured ballot papers will be used, but what will happen at the polling station if a colour-blind person places the ballot paper in the wrong box—or if someone who is not colour blind unwittingly places the wrong-coloured ballot paper in the sealed box, immediately recognises the mistake and informs the returning officer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me take hon. Members through the process. The political agents who are involved will have knowledge of the system. On entering the poling station, advice will be available, and at larger polling stations, extra people will be employed by the returning officers to ensure that help is afforded to older people and those with special difficulties, At the point where the ballot is cast, the ballot boxes will be colour coded in peach, purple and white—people may put their ballot papers in the wrong box. After the conclusion of voting at 10 o'clock in each of the areas where counts are taking place, boxes for the Scottish parliament will be opened, and a check will be made on the colours in each box. If a ballot has been cast in the wrong box, it will be transferred to the right box. The boxes will then be counted properly at the place of the count.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That process will be repeated for the local government boxes, so that if Scottish Parliament papers are in a box for the local government elections, they will be transferred. All the right colour papers will thereby end up in the right colour boxes. That will overcome the problem, which we have foreseen, that people may, for a variety of reasons, put ballot papers in the wrong box. If someone makes a mistake, it will be rectified before proper verification at the count. That can only be helpful to all concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome that reassurance. However, to reduce the amount of re-sorting at the count, would it be possible to amend form S, which instructs voters to
	<br><blockquote><p>"put each ballot paper in the ballot box"?</p></blockquote>
It would be more helpful if it referred to the "appropriate" ballot box or the "correctly coloured" ballot box. Will it be possible, following our consideration of the order, for the Minister to make that minor amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the face of it, that is a reasonable point. I am not sure whether the wording can be adjusted. The suggestion is that the from should cover information on the colour of the ballot box. That will be covered by a separate form—AD. We have ensured that if people cast ballot papers in the wrong box, they will all be rescued at an important stage before the election process proceeds. Furthermore, the Scottish Office is funding an extensive training programme for front-line staff, which has already begun. At the first point of entry for people at the polling station, and at the last point of output of the papers, these matters will be taken care of.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The disqualification of certain office-holders has a precedent in the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975, which consolidated a previous Act. In considering which office-holders should be disqualified from the Scottish Parliament, we paid particular heed to that well
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
established and well understood precedent, which embodies principles that have been well known for 40 years. We concluded that it would not be appropriate to depart radically from that approach at this stage. The orders makes provisions for the first elections, which will continue until such time as the Scottish Parliament makes its own provisions. I am sure that hon. Members will agree that it is right for the Scottish Parliament to be able to decide the scope of the disqualification provisions for its membership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In deciding who should be disqualified, we applied the criteria used to determine whether an office-holder should be disqualified from the House of Commons. Our aim has been to maintain the Scottish Parliaments's independence and safeguard MSPs from undue influence by the Executive through the exercise of patronage. The disqualification order would disqualify office-holders who would be disqualified from becoming a Member of Parliament, if we thought that it was appropriate to the circumstances of the Scottish parliament—if office-holders were operating in devolved matters or in areas where Scottish Minister had an interest, for example. Such office-holders will be accountable to the Parliament, so it would clearly be wrong if they could also be an MSP. Officer-holders who fall into that category would include members of Scottish water authorities or members of Scottish Enterprise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Office-holders holding a disqualifying office would be required to resign that office before giving their formal consent to nomination. This provision is contained in the conduct of elections order. The consent to nomination must be given by the last day for the delivery of nomination papers, and may be submitted up to one month before that. For the Scottish Parliament elections, consent to nomination must be submitted by 13 April. That would mean that people holding disqualifying offices would be required to resign by that date at the latest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We think that the list of disqualified office-holders strikes the right balance between ensuring that the Parliament is open to a wide range of talented people, but is properly independent and able to hold the Executive to account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There may be a drafting error, or perhaps it is my mistake, but among those who would be excluded from the Parliament are members of British Shipbuilders. Is that organisation still in being and, if so, is an Act of Parliament required to put it to sleep? I thought that the organisation had disappeared but if it is still in being, does that affect those employee representatives on the British Shipbuilders pension fund board?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raises an interesting point. I raised this issue before coming to the Committee. This provision is about bodies or organisations that are in receipt of Government grants. I believe that in long days past, some companies in public ownership were in receipt of substantial grants. My understanding, which I shall have clarified, is that that is what it pertains to, so there is a provision in the order to reflect that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0084">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
I am assured that the provision covers very few people now, because of the changing nature of Government grants. As a courtesy, I shall write to my hon. Friend the Member for Greenock and Inverclyde (Dr. Godman) on the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.56 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to detain the Committee long, and I hope that other hon. Members will take the same view. The bundle of papers before us is formidable but on reading it, I discovered that, as the Minister says, most of it is familiar to those of us who have lived with the Representation of the Peoples Acts for a long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have four or five points for the Minister. First, I understand from his comments and from the order that all the limits set out in the elections order have been the subject of cross-party consultation. Indeed, members of my party in Scotland maintain that they are agreed, so I hope that the Committee will not need to dwell on mat matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that connection, following the earlier discussion in Committee, article 41(2) could benefit from a slight alteration—although I suspect that that may be procedurally impossible—or, perhaps more constructively, from some illumination in the guidance notes. That would enable those who are in the odd position of being both individuals on the list and constituency candidates—if there are some such—to know that paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) are additive, and that they may also qualify under those paragraphs for an additional dollop of the expenditure limit as a constituency candidate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under article 26(3)(b) of die elections order—I have no comments on the other orders—a person who is entitled to a postal vote and then decides that he or she would like to vote in person, is disentitled from doing so. I am not clear about the reason for that provision, and why it appears to have been in place at an earlier stage in statutory history. If there is a good reason for it, fine. If not, it would be helpful to have the Minister's clarification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 88 is, in the light of the Scotland Act 1998, not objectionable in itself, but it raises a point of deep constitutional principle. I have committed myself to bore hon. Members on every occasion on which that point of principle arises, by mentioning that we disapprove of such powers. The article is invoked under a Henry VIII clause of the Scotland Act 1998. It modifies an Act of Parliament by statutory instrument. That is wrong; although I admit that my Government also engaged in such nefarious practices—Governments of both colours have done so. That practice should no longer obtain, and it is a pity to see it followed here. Unfortunately, paragraph 63 of schedule 2 contains another example of the same practice, and it would be better if that article and that paragraph were not present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 88 contains another constitutional outrage that I fear is legitimated by the Scotland Act 1998, which is intrinsic to the lamentable additional member system construct. It is the worst single feature of a bad system. I
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
am perfectly aware that we cannot do anything about it being in the order, because it is there because it is in the Act. If I have understood it correctly, it allows for the substitution of one person by another by fiat of party headquarters upon the resignation or death of a person, which would otherwise have caused a by-election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It could even be a Government-forced resignation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend says, that may happen under odd circumstances. As I said, we cannot object to that provision in the order, as it follows the Act. However, it is lamentable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having uttered those expressions of nostalgia and sadness—nostalgia for a time when the electoral system inaugurated in these orders did not exist, and sadness that the logic of the Scotland Act 1998 has been followed in those respects—I must say mat the Minister and his officials have done a remarkable job of assimilating the Neill committee recommendations, as agreed between parties, and the Representations of the People Acts 1983 and 1986, in a clear order, notwithstanding its length. It is heartening that there was such cross-party consultation, and that the whole assemblage is aimed at achieving a result to which all hon. Members subscribe: fair elections. I hope and expect that the Minister and his colleagues, including the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, will exercise similar care and engage in similar constructive dialogue with the Opposition in assisting my hon. Friend the Member for Blaby (Mr. Robathan) with his Referendums Bill, which aims to impose die same sort of constraints on unfair practice in referendums.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.3 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two questions that I should like to ask my hon. Friend. The first concerns the date of the first meeting of the Scottish Parliament—12 May. It would be useful to people who are planning to stand for that Parliament who are at present employed elsewhere if he would clarify whether that it her day on which they would take the oath, and from which they would be paid as Members of the Scottish Parliament. Obviously, such people will need to know when to give in their notice and from when they can expect to be paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second question relates to a matter that was raised in the Scottish press a few weeks ago. Some people are considering standing for a seat in a job-share. I understand that this were told that that was not permitted under the Scotland Act 1998, but the Act does not say that they could not do so—I do not think that anyone considered that possibility when we were debating the Act. It would be helpful to those who are considering that if my hon. Friend clarified the position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.4 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following the point made by the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) about how the orders have been put together, I wonder which order he was reading and to which order he was referring. The copy that I picked up on Tuesday from the Whips Office
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0085">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
contained so many errors that an erratum slip was issued, and a new order was laid on Wednesday. Sadly, that order was wrongly collated, and I think that appendix 2 appeared in the middle of appendix 5. Today, I picked up an order from the Vote Office, which I was told was the corrected and definitive version, although some pages appear to be upside down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister moves to another Ministry—I hope that he does not—and that the Liberal Democrats' election campaign is successful, perhaps he could leave behind some hope that there will be a bit more stability in considering statutory instruments. His ministerial colleague in the Scottish Office, the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald), undertook to explore the possibility of listing those consulted on the back of the draft order to save time, to avoid going round in circles, and to ensue that Committee members knew before meeting whether the Minister had consulted certain people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some reservations about the orders, which, as I understand them, will make a fundamental change to the system that we are used to. I understand that someone seeking to stand in an election will no longer require proposers, seconders or assenters. People can therefore put themselves forward as candidates without having to demonstrate any support in the community for their candidature, and obtain free postal delivery of any literature about themselves that they wish to make available to the constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Previous Governments have been upset about the diversity of political opinions advanced by candidates in by-elections, and have sought to limit it by increasing the deposit threshold. I and my party have always felt that that is not a democratic way in which to ensure that people present a genuine view in an election. It would be preferable to increase the number of assenters, to ensure that people attempting to stand in an election have some legitimate support in their communities. I am not quite sure why the Government are making such a big change to that culture by statutory instrument, given that the orders in many other ways reflect traditional practices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other aspects of the system could have been changed but have' not been, such as the nightmare of trying to register people for absent votes. The Minister will be aware of the plethora of forms that are necessary when meeting somebody who wants to vote in absence. The procedure requires specification of whether that person has a long-term illness, a short-term illness, a short-term job, a long-term job, and so on. There are different forms for every possible reason why somebody might want an absent vote. Will the Minister reconsider that procedure?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The election limit is another matter of substance with which the orders deal. I believe that the Government have not thought out fully the implications of imposing a limit across Scotland that can be ploughed into any region. Most parties are traditionally spread across the whole area, but some may wish to target a vote. For example, the Scottish Socialist Alliance may decide that Glasgow is the one place where it can raise money. It may not be able to raise £1.5 million, but if it thought that that were possible, it would probably target that area. There is talk of a highland alliance party. Will the Minister clarify what
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
constitutes a party in terms of national expenditure? Does its candidates have to stand in more than one region? What if a party wishes to stand in one region only?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know from the history of elections that people who reside in Mexico and other places are keen to pour their money into Britain. It is not beyond the wit of man to envisage somebody standing in a first-past-the-post election for one seat on the regional list, and pouring all of his or her resources into winning that seat. I suspect that it is probably not possible for the Minister to take much action because of the procedures of the House, but will he reflect on the matter? I do not believe that it has been fully thought out. As people get used to slick ticketing and the way in which the electoral system works, it will become farcical for candidates or parties to pour resources into areas where they have no chance. The Minister suggests that people will be frightened of doing that because of the publication of their accounts after the election. I am not quite sure whether such people would be worried about that, having achieved their desired result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final concern relates to the method of counting for the regional lists. As I understand it, the orders contain no ability to call a recount on a close result. The only method of challenge is by electoral petition in the courts. If everyone in central Scotland voted exactly as they did at the previous election, 158 votes would separate two different parties. Although we recognise the need for recounts in local and central Government elections when the results are close, it seems strange that there is no recount procedure for the regions. The reason is the great desire to get the results out the same night. However, there is usually a central count for the European elections. An elector might well prefer 12 hours' delay and the right result to the wrong result at 3 o'clock or 4 o'clock in the morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister reconsider how recounts for close results are to be handled? Statistically, a close result could happen, but it is not allowed for in the order. The tossing of a coin is prescribed in the case of an identical result on a regional list, but although the order recognises that results can be close, it does not take into account the boundary area between a definitive result and a tie.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, to those of us who go into ballot booths, form S looks awfully like the form that will be stuck up in front of voters. It is the form that is most likely to reach people's eyes and to convey information that they will take away. If there is any way that the Minister could add to it the word "appropriate", better use would be made of it—it would not then contradict the other leaflets about the polling booth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be grateful if the Minister would tackle those three issues of substance—the total change to our method of election in not requiring a person's assent to being a candidate; election limits in terms of what the Minister defines as a national party; and how close results will be dealt with under the regional list system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.11 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief, Mr. Butterfill. I am pleased to see that the arrangements deal adequately with the concerns of blind people. My hon. Friend the Minister
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0086">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
must forgive me, because I had time only to glance through the documents. Does a blind person's companion have to be designated before he or she goes into the polling station? I presume that we are talking about only two score or three score of people throughout Scotland, but what about those who temporarily lose their eyesight as a result of an accident or hospital operation? How will their interests be protected vis-a-vis companions and assistance in polling stations?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that a sufficient number of polling stations will be set up in each constituency. Let us not forget that some of us have fairly hilly constituencies; it is a bit of a toil for an elderly person to climb up a hill for several hundred yards, although it is always easier going down after voting. I also hope that each and every polling station will be barrier free for frail elderly people and those who have to use wheelchairs. We have all experienced such problems in our constituencies, but I hope that they do not resurface in this election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to keep to my promise of being brief, but I have a couple of comments relating to the order dealing with the setting up of the election and the Parliament's first meeting. When I suggested to my hon. Friend that Thursday 6 May should be a public holiday, he replied in his characteristically courteous way that I really ought to get lost. He added that it would be a celebration, and I do not disagree. I hope that I will be celebrating in Renfrewshire, but I shall not go further down that path— I might upset Opposition Members. I genuinely believe that it should be a public holiday. In some states, a general election is held on a public holiday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final point concerns the day, time and place appointed by the Scottish Parliament. We all know that it will meet in the assembly hall on The Mound, but my hon. Friend will know my interest in the new Parliament and that I disagree with our right hon. Friend the Secretary of State over the successful design. Can he give us any idea when the successful Members will take their places in the new Parliament at Holyrood?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Roseanna Cunningham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to join the hon. Member for West Dorset in paying compliment to the Minister. It is a testament to the amount of work that has been done in Scotland that these orders have been produced in a relatively uncontroversial fashion. The lack of controversy is the result of the extensive cross-party meetings and consultation that have taken place over a considerable period. I hope that the Minister will agree that that is a good sign for the way in which the Parliament will work in future. As a result of the pre-legislative consultation exercise, items may come before that Parliament that are as widely welcomed as the order is here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the comments made by the hon. Member for Greenock and Inverclyde about a public holiday, although I am not sure about having it on the day of the election. Although I would like a public holiday, if we are to start putting in bids for the date, 1 July might be more appropriate as that is the formal opening of the Parliament. I am not sure that having a public holiday on
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
the day of the election would be entirely appropriate. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman expects more than one extra public holiday this year in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Could the Minister explain the implications of the first meeting on 12 May? It has been suggested to me that it may cause undue haste in the setting up of the Administration. What does he think will have had to have happened between 6 May and 12 May? What precisely will happen on 12 May? Will a business committee have had to have met before then, although I cannot imagine how that would happen? Will a form of Administration come into play, even with only two individuals, the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister because, as I understand it, their elections take place on 12 May too?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As someone who has a seriously visually impaired member of my wider family, I should also like to associate myself with the remarks made earlier about the problems that blind or visually impaired people can sometimes experience at polling stations. I should like to have the clarification that was requested earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raise this final issue only because of the little flurry of misunderstanding a month or two ago—I put it no higher than that. Will the Minister confirm that the cross-party agreement extended to agreement on the national expenses of £1.5 million? The agreement included all the parties. The meetings at which that agreement was reached were hosted by and held in the offices of the Scottish National party. I put that on the record as the Minister will remember a slight misunderstanding that was publicly expressed some weeks ago. I would be obliged if he could confirm that the agreement extended that far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the forebearance of the Committee, I shall try to go through these points as quickly as possible. In response to the hon. Member for West Dorset, we would be happy to ask officials to consider drawing the King committee's attention to the guidance for candidates who stand in both parts of the process. We shall ensure that that is done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A question was asked about entitlement to. vote in person after receiving a postal vote. A current provision in electoral law specifies that someone who has a postal vote cannot vote in person. Its purpose is to prevent double voting. Postal ballot papers are issued approximately a week before the election and, therefore, can be submitted before close of poll. We are doing nothing that is different from current practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Dorset asked about filling regional seats and the party veto. That subject was debated extensively on the Floor of the House. We discussed making provisions for flexibility in filling vacancies if someone left a party. There is nothing sinister in that. However, when I was in opposition, everything was sinister! Parties will be involved, but for a good reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Dorset also asked about the Henry VIII clause in article 88. We made it clear that the Bill would use the order to add more detail about filling seats between elections. Our proceedings would not be enhanced by going into further detail this afternoon.

I appreciate the comments about trying to make sense of matters in a cross-party way. We are not considering the final result and the way in which we shall proceed; we are trying to ensure that people understand the process, that it facilitates matters and is a boost for democracy, not an obstacle in its way. Therefore, cross-party support has been extraordinarily helpful. It will send a powerful message to people in Scotland about the seriousness of the elections. All parties want to succeed on 6 May not only for themselves, but for Scotland.

My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) asked about job share. If the highland alliance takes the matter further, it will have to be resolved in the courts. We included a provision for one member, one seat in the Scotland Act 1998. That does not make sense to everybody, and—job sharing is being pushed. However, at present, the people of Scotland are more inclined to accept the wisdom of one member, one seat. The list system extends the process, but the problem will end up in the courts. The Government's position is sound—we believe that we should proceed on the current basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me comment on the wider issue of family-friendly policies. The Parliament is being constructed to encourage people—women in particular—to stand, and to want to be part of it. Some women, who perhaps believe that being in Westminster is onerous would be comfortable about coming forward in Scotland. Job sharing may provide an interesting debating point beyond the elections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend for Maryhill talked about the limits of standing for both the Scottish Parliament and Westminster. The constituency return is submitted, as now, and for all regional lists, expenses are part of national accounts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Might not the Minister accommodate his hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That raises an interesting spectre for democracy and the logistics of the new Parliament.

I do not wish to digress, but I will say that one issue that job-share highland alliances tend to forget is that a Member will be there with a set of principles and voting procedures and
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
the certainty that he or she may be there to cast a vote. It is the deeper implications of a jobshare in this sphere of political activity that raise serious doubts.

My hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill asked when an employee would have to resign. Disqualification provisions effectively apply from the date on which the candidate signs and submits the nomination papers, as at that time the candidate must confirm that he or she is not disqualified from being returned as a Member. A candidate must resign before the election: this applies to Westminster, and will apply for the Edinburgh Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am talking not about people who may be disqualified but about those who are qualified to stand but are employed elsewhere at present. Will they take the Oath, become Members of the Scottish Parliament and start to receive a salary on 12 May, or will they start to receive a salary from 1 July? Candidates need to know that important information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A list of all MSPs elected on 6 May is returned to the Clerk, as happens at Westminster. But I shall clarify for my hon. Friend whether the salary will start from that point. Things need be no different from what happens at Westminster. The importance of the dates is simply that 6 May is election day and that on 7 May there will be Members of the new Edinburgh Parliament. We shall come later to what takes place on 12 May. There is a transition period between 12 May and 1 July when the orders kick in for the Parliament's work.

The hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir R. Smith) asked about centres. Questions about the best way to make the system fair have been raised previously, there is widespread belief that there would be no discouragement to frivolous candidates. We think it better to allow just the nominee and a signature, and proceed from there. We have introduced that because it is straightforward. Whether the serious suggestion of having eight people assent to assign nomination would have an effect is merely one aspect; the other is that surely we should make it as easy as possible for people to stand for election, with electors deciding whether individual candidates are worthwhile.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has said that the present system does not discourage vexatious or frivolous candidatures. Has he entertained the possibility that his proposed new system will lower the threshold further and encourage an increase in frivolous candidatures?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The logic of my earlier remarks was no—	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am having great difficulty hearing the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The logic of my earlier remarks was that the new system would not, in our judgment, result in an increase in frivolous candidates. Ultimately, this is about people wishing to stand for election. We are suggesting a simplified process, which we do not think will accelerate the number of frivolous candidates. Indeed, our case is based on the fact that the current position does not discourage them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: However, will the Minister tell the Committee when the proposal was initiated, who was consulted and how wide a discussion there has been on such a change?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that this matter is being discussed. All we are suggesting for this election is that we go ahead on this new basis, which is a reasonable way to proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister clarify whether the working party had discussions about these proposals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not privy to every detail discussed in the working party, but I will gladly reply to the hon. Gentleman's question. The hon. Gentleman also raised the issue of regional limits. We are again building on the Neill committee, which saw no reason to distinguish between national and regional expenditure. In the Scottish context, all parties are supporting the position that has been established by the committee. It is important to know that if any party has been involved, it will be exposed. I cannot see why any party operating within a £1.5 million limit would want to skew its expenditure to such an extent. However, it remains part of the rules of the game that that can happen. The sensible way forward is to take on the new recommendations and put them forward in a voluntary committee—as we are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Briefly, will the Minister clarify the definition of a national party? In how many regions does one have to stand before it becomes national expenditure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For expense purposes and limits, a party is necessarily defined with reference to registered political parties. Considering the issue more widely than finances alone—to include broadcasting, for example—we are trying to clarify the circumstances in which parties could qualify. We would then need some criteria that could be satisfied—and we are looking at a half-and-half position. One would need to be standing in four or more of the Euro-seats and, at the same time, have more than half of the list—hence four times seven, which would be 28.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is immensely complicated, but we are trying to ensure that individuals belonging to parties do not feel disadvantaged merely because they are competing in certain parts of Scotland. We felt that it was important to have a threshold to deal with that. Scotland is leading the way in implementing the recommendations of the Neill committee. I hope that that will benefit electors as well as political parties.

The hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine also asked about recounts. The regional vote can be recounted at each constituency counting centre, but not after the regional result has been submitted to the regional returning officer. A request for a recount can happen at the constituency level of counting, before the numbers have been intimated to the regional counting officer. At the regional level, however, a counting officer will not then be able to conduct a recount. As I have explained, some facility—however limited—exists at the appropriate level.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My concern is that, among the eight to 10 constituencies in a region, no one constituency may have a close result, but the cumulative result could be as close as one vote. At that point, one wonders how safe that result would be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again the logic of the question is that one vote at the regional level is likely to reflect one vote at the local level, but one cannot have recounts at the regional level. We need to accept the reality that a recount is possible at the constituency level but that, once the result has been submitted to the regional returning officer, allowing a further recount would open up the process to unlimited difficulties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister over-emphasises the unlimited difficulties of doing that. If the regional vote were counted in one centre, as currently counted for the European elections, all the ballot boxes were taken to that centre, those difficulties would be overcome. However, we need to recognise the geographical nature of voting in parts of Scotland, particularly in the north-east, where some seats may not be close in one constituency because two different parties—Conservatives and Liberal Democrats in my constituency; nationalists and the Liberal Democrats in Banff and Buchan; Labour and Liberal Democrats in Aberdeen, South—are contending, but it is statistically possible for all those results added together to be extremely close. As the regulations recognise, the result could be so close as to need a toss of the coin at the regional level, whereas at the individual constituency level, it may not be obvious that that is going to happen and people may be confident that a recount is not needed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That raises enormous problems for the constituency count in relation to the regional level. We are making a reasonable attempt to deal with the problem by saying that, at the local constituency level where votes are being counted towards the regional group, a recount could be considered. At that stage, it would then be reasonable to say, "Well, there are one or two differences," and, depending on the returning officer's criteria, there could be a recount.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose—</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall continue my explanation and then give way to my hon. Friend. If it is then decided that all the constituency-based votes should go to a regional counting centre, there will be the problems that I mentioned earlier with coloured papers and so on. The proposed system is tidy and I think it will work. I hope that there will be no problems of the kind that the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine has suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To take the example given by the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine, if there is Conservative-Liberal Democrat angst it is more likely to be at constituency level. Therefore, there will be more concentration on getting the count right in that area
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0089">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
than at a regional centre where regional representatives will count the votes. At local level they will be more watchful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an obvious point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take a simple example: let us suppose that, in a two-constituency region, the Conservatives beat Labour in, for example, Aberdeen, South by 5,002 votes and that Labour wins by 5,000 in Aberdeen, North. No one will call for a recount in either constituency; but add the two together and the regional list count will be as close as two votes. The Minister must bear in mind that it often happens that, every time that there is a recount, the total shifts considerably. That may not happen; the Minister may be lucky in this election, but if there is a close result there will have to be an election petition for a recount to challenge the result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I stay by the point. In regional counts, with approximately 10 constituencies—for example, Mid Scotland and Fife—it would make practical sense at the local constituency level to say, "You can have a recount of that vote." The practical implications of doing what the hon. Gentleman suggests are formidable. We believe that we have the right solution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Reluctant as I am to agree with the Liberal Democrats, the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine is on to something serious, and the situation is worse than he described because we are dealing with d'Hondt devisors. There may be a multiple cancellation of effect: a series of constituencies may be won clearly, but they may cancel one another out, so that the overall regional effect is close. However, even if the regional result was not close it would be enormously important whether the result was two more or two less for a particular party because, when divided by one more than the number of seats that the party had won in the region, the effect vis-à-vis another party could lead to a different balance of power, not just in that region but in the Parliament. That will cause concern if it cannot be reconsidered at regional level. I had not attended to the issue in sufficient detail, as I did not understand that it would not be possible to re-open the question at regional level.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always anxious when the hon. Gentleman says that we have a serious problem, but there is not a serious problem and the orders have been prepared on that basis. We have provided the facility of a recount at constituency level and, taking into account the d'Hondt system and the ensuing calculations, we are talking not about luck, but about a reasonable process in reasonable circumstances. That is what the order provides.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is very courteous to give way again. I ask my question another way: let us assume that there are eight constituencies in a particular region
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
and seven have already been counted. All the parties will have their own computer programmes and will be able to make the d'Hondt calculations in advance. Let us suppose that the eighth constituency result is entirely clear—it is a massive majority one way or the other, but all the parties involved in the count agree that, because of the division sum, the regional result is of immense importance to all of them and they all agree that it is close. In those circumstances, could that eighth constituency be recounted or would the constituency result itself have to trigger the recount?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unless Conservative modelling for election results is far superior to ours, I cannot see that happening. A close result at a particular constituency is not necessary to enable a party to request a recount. Centre recounts can be conducted up to the point when the returning officer believes that it is no longer reasonable to recount. That is still within the constituency set-up. That is a reasonable way forward, which the Committee should accept. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am not sure how near the Minister is to finishing. We could dispose of this or we could reconvene after the Division in the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If it helps the Committee, I will do that; if not, I should be delighted to respond later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
