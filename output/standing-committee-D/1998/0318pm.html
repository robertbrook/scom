	<p>Pension sharing orders: England and Wales</p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed [this day]:</i> No. 149, in page 68, line 41, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(c) is made in terms to be prescribed in regulations.".—[	<i>Mr. Quentin Davies.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>2.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be for the convenience of the Committee if I say that I propose that we take a break from 4 pm to 5 pm, resuming at 5 pm till 7 pm and then taking a break this evening until 8.30 pm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Jacqui Lait 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beckenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Malins. Just before lunch I told the Minister that my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) was on Select Committee business in Hong Kong. In fact, he is leading the all-party delegation to Hong Kong. I want to put that on the record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Grantham and Stamford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we broke for lunch, I was explaining why I found the Minister's response to amendment No. 149 less than convincing. It is splendid that the Lord Chancellor's advisory group on ancillary relief should consider pension orders. As far as I know, it has not been charged with any such task—certainly not by Parliament—but it may produce an ideal text that represents the form that a pension-sharing order should adopt. Unless the amendment is accepted, there is no obligation on the courts to accept one form of pension-sharing order. It will be open to each court to take its own view on what an appropriate pension-sharing order is. It will be open to counsel for one party to argue that the form that the other party is proposing is in some way inadequate or should be varied. It will be open to either counsel to plead in aid the advisory group's view that that text should be adopted, if there is such a report or if, at some future time, there were to be one. That may be a strong argument, but it can be debated by the court. The opposing side's counsel will be able to take an alternative view and seek to persuade the judge that in that instance, given the circumstances of the case, the standard form of pension-sharing order referred to by his learned friend is not appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not need to go on. I give the Committee the flavour of what will, in my view, be unnecessary litigation, taking much longer than the proceedings of the Committee, because not many judges are as severe as you are, Mr. Malins, in their interpretation of the rules of relevance: few of them seem to have much regard to the time taken by the proceedings under their supervision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>324</span>
The Opposition's objective is to try to remove sources of litigation, dispute, disagreement and negotiation between solicitors and conflicting arguments between counsel that are not germane to the substance of the issue—the appropriate division of assets between the parties—but are ancillary. We tabled our amendment in that spirit. It is no response for the Minister to say that the Lord Chancellor's advisory group on ancillary relief is considering the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is telling me that the Lord Chancellor's advisory group is producing a text and the Lord Chancellor then intends to circularise judges, saying that that text should be used in all circumstances for a pension-sharing order, that may meet the sense of the amendment and the objective that I described. It seems curious and unprecedented—and inherently dubious—for the Lord Chancellor to give judges instructions of that kind. The Lord Chancellor can provide guidance, but guidance is not binding—it is open to counsel to argue that, in special cases, it should not apply. If the Lord Chancellor is to give instructions, that is a dubious legal precedent to establish. If they are not instructions but guidance, our concern will not be met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is far more desirable for Parliament to decide on these matters. Parliament is creating the judicial issue and Parliament is providing for pension splitting or sharing in the Bill, if it is passed. It is up to Parliament to anticipate, and do something about, the difficulties and the extraneous and incremental legal issues that the introduction of pension sharing will entrain. Only Parliament can set binding limitations on the freedom of the courts, because it can insert a provision in the Bill to ensure that limits are set on jurisprudence and that it is not possible to argue for flexibility in a particular case. We have established that there should not be flexibility—that is the purpose of my amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On that basis—unless the Minister argues that I have fundamentally misunderstood the issue before us or his response—I shall invite my hon. Friends to vote for the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security (Mr. Stephen Timms)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just to clarify the record, what I said earlier related to the development of rules of court rather than guidance that the courts can take account of if they choose to do so. The power to make such rules is provided by section 40 of the Matrimonial and Family Proceedings Act 1984. It is therefore a normal procedure and not a novel one as the hon. Gentleman suggested. The Lord Chancellor's ancillary relief advisory group has been invited to consider the appropriate format for pension-sharing orders and rules of court will be subject to the negative resolution procedure in the same way as regulations. All of the hon. Gentleman's concerns will therefore be met.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If so, I should like to ask the Minister why he cannot accept the amendment, which merely states that the pension-sharing order will be in terms to be prescribed in regulations. The Minister has just said that it will be so prescribed. He has acknowledged that the Government share the objectives of the amendment, so it is suspicious that he cannot accept it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0649">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>325</span>
If the amendment were added to the Bill, there would be no doubt about the need for such regulations. If those regulations are to be in the form of court rules, that is fully satisfactory. At least the Lord Chancellor—having delegated the work to the ancillary relief advisory group or another body—would have an obligation to produce them. Certainty that the regulations will be produced is important; otherwise there is merely a generalised assurance. Why cannot the Minister accept an explicit obligation to produce regulations of that type?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to prolong this debate unnecessarily. Clearly, I cannot accept an amendment that states that the pension-sharing order will be prescribed in regulations; it will be prescribed in rules of court. That is a significant difference. I am glad that the hon. Gentleman raised that matter and I hope that he accepts that the rules of court route meets all of his concerns. I cannot accept the amendment because that route is different from the regulations process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman may respond briefly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are making progress. Our debate is moving steadily towards a consensus—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind the hon. Gentleman that he has caught my eye on four occasions in this short debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that, Mr. Malins.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has effectively given an assurance that the purpose of my amendment will be fulfilled by a different route and that when the regulations are made, they will be subject to the negative resolution procedure in the House. We take that commitment on trust, as we always do. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 162, in page 69, line 24, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3A) The Court shall not exercise its powers under this section unless it is satisfied that it cannot achieve a just redistribution of the parties' resources by using its other powers under section 21 above.".</p></blockquote>
This important amendment limits the scope for pension splitting and for pension sharing to the cases in which it is necessary to use that route. There are several reasons why we should be reluctant to use that route. I mentioned the first in another context this morning—namely, the fact that pension sharing and pension splitting involve additional costs. In other words, the assets to be split will be reduced by the simple fact of splitting them. That problem is specific to pension sharing and pension splitting. If one gives a person a house or one assigns them £1,000 a week, that does not reduce the value of the house or the sum of money, but if one splits a pension, costs are involved and the amount to be split will fall. It follows that that approach should be adopted only when it is absolutely necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>326</span>
The second consideration—I feel no embarrassment in raising this, although I am not sure whether the Government share my view—is the fact that there is something special about pension assets. They often represent the fruits of a working lifetime, in which a person has saved and provided for his pension. We recognise that fact in our legal system, which gives tax advantages to pensions. The Government and the Opposition were at one in providing additional protections for pension assets against bankruptcy. In a sense, our legal system already recognises the fact that pension assets are rather special and we should be reluctant to deprive a person who has earned them of their benefits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gainsborough)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a good point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that I have my hon. Friends support on that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend always has my support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My remarks will find a resonance in the country—people feel that there is something special about pensions and that depriving people of a pension for which they have worked for many years involves particular unfairness. Allowing people to keep their assets, wherever possible, is in society's interests and it promotes fairness to the individual. We should allow them to do so even in circumstances in which they might not otherwise have been able to keep their accumulated assets. Bankruptcy is a pertinent analogy in that context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Evidence supporting that approach is contained in the Select Committee report, which is the locus classicus for the arguments for and against pension splitting. We are grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) and the hon. Member for Gravesham (Mr. Pond)—I do not know whether any other Committee members served on the Select Committee at that time—for working hard to produce this excellent report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Page 62 of the report contains pertinent evidence given by Mr. Martin Pointer on behalf of the Family Law Bar Association, which is a highly respectable body. To be appointed as its spokesman—I assume that he is its chairman—on a major legislative initiative is testimony to the respect with which Mr. Martin Pointer QC is held by his colleagues at the Bar. Mr. Pointer said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I think that Parliament should consider whether or not it wants the judge to treat a pension-sharing order as high on his list of priorities or as only something that he should do if there are not any other liquid resources"—</p></blockquote>
and, more importantly—
	<br><blockquote><p>"that Parliament should form a view about that one way or the other, and that that should be reflected in the legislation."</p></blockquote>
2.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Pointer suggested that Parliament should make the decision on pension splitting or sharing. We should decide whether it should be an automatic response of a court charged with the reallocation of assets on divorce; a reserve weapon to be used when it is not possible to make a fair allocation; or a tool to be used in special
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0650">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>327</span>
circumstances or under the general criteria in section 25 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, which require it to be considered as a means of fulfilling courts, obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be remiss of Parliament not to respond to Mr. Pointer's invitation and that is the purpose of our amendment. It states that pension sharing should not occur unless the court
	<br><blockquote><p>"is satisfied that it cannot achieve a just redistribution of the parties' resources by using its other powers under section 21".</p></blockquote>
Section 21 sets out the powers of divorce courts to make orders for periodical payments, lump sums or the split of property assets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment goes to the heart of a chief—if not the essential—difference between the Government and the Opposition on pension sharing. The triumphalist, militant feminist approach of the previous Secretary of State, which was displayed in the introductory document to the draft legislation last summer, made it clear that pension sharing should be regarded as a positive gain for humanity. However, we are reluctant to deprive the courts of any flexibility in the sad matter of matrimonial breakdown. We recognise that there may be arguments for adding this pension-sharing weapon to the courts' armoury, but we also recognise that there are sources of unfairness, including perverse incentives and incremental and gratuitous costs, if pension sharing is used to fulfil the obligations of courts to make a fair distribution of assets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mark Oaten 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Winchester)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Pond 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gravesham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way first to the hon. Member for Gravesham, who contributed to the Select Committee report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seek clarification of the suggestion that there is a militant feminist approach. The hon. Gentleman is speaking on behalf of the Conservative party and in the past few moments has made some fundamental criticisms of the principle of pension sharing. Will he clarify whether it is now Conservative party policy to oppose pension sharing in principle? There seems to be some division among his hon. Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman should restrict his question to the hon. Gentleman's policy on the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>. The question is so fundamental that I seek your indulgence, Mr. Malins, in allowing me to answer it briefly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A fundamental question it may be, but not for the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Member for Gravesham has not so far listened to my speech on amendment No. 162, but if he reads 	<i>Hansard,</i> he will answer his own question. He will see that during the past two or three minutes I said that the Conservative party would be reluctant to deprive the courts of flexibility in dealing with the difficult issues that confront them in cases of marriage breakdown and we accept that there may be a role for pension sharing. We are not, in principle, against adding that weapon to the courts' armoury, but we are aware—this
	<span class='label label-info column'>328</span>
distinguishes us from the Government—that there are some particular dangers and difficulties with the pension-sharing weapon. I have referred to unfairness, the danger of perverse incentives and the additional incremental and avoidable costs, which do not arise in the case of other assets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to you, Mr. Malins, for allowing me to summarise what I said earlier and I am sure that you agree that it is for the convenience of the whole Committee to have no doubt about the Conservative party's position. One Labour Member, having allowed his attention to drift to other matters, may have failed to hear me on the first occasion, but I hope that he heard me on the second occasion and now has no doubt about our policy and where it differs from that of the new Labour Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oaten</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman appears to be arguing against his own amendment. He is calling for flexibility and not tying the courts' hands, but his amendment would do just that. Surely it is sensible for these complex issues to be left to the courts to decide, rather than introducing restrictions that could get in the way of sensible judgments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am arguing not against flexibility but for the courts to have an additional weapon—an auxiliary weapon and not a mainstream approach to splitting assets. We should provide the courts with a reserve weapon, not something to be used automatically. It is curious that the hon. Gentleman argues that the courts should resolve such matters when the representative of the Family Law Bar Association said precisely what I am saying: that Parliament should establish for the benefit of the courts some sense of the order of priorities with which the different weapons are to be used. It is wrong and irresponsible to give the courts additional weapons with no indication of how they should be used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To do so leaves the burden of establishing an order of priorities to jurisprudence—if a coherent order can ever be established. That leads to uncertainty and, inevitably, unnecessary and avoidable litigation, with massive incremental cost to the individuals who are unlucky enough to be the victims. We believe that, for all the reasons that I have set out, the weapon of pension sharing should not be the first, or even necessarily the second, approach taken by a court charged with redistributing assets; it should be regarded as a reserve power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Parliament does not give clear guidance on how to resolve those issues and simply leaves the matter to the courts, it will open up a vast field of litigation and legal costs. If that happens, the result will be the extremely diverse use of this weapon by the courts. In many cases, it will be used unfairly and the difficulties to which I have alluded will appear in practice. Those arguments were only confirmed by the two interventions by the hon. Members for Winchester and for Gravesham. At least the hon. Member for Winchester was awake and the hon. Member for Gravesham was no longer intimidated to speak, as other Labour Members have been until now. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Well, they have made only two
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0651">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>329</span>
interventions throughout the course of the several sittings that we have spent discussing stakeholder pensions, one of which involved a remark of such unctuous servility—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is sufficient for the hon. Gentleman to refer to the matter without going into what was said. The first part of his speech was off the point of the amendment and the second part was even further away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very well, Mr. Malins. The solution to that problem is not to be drawn by any sort of reaction or intervention by Labour Members, but our proceedings would be somewhat boring and mechanistic if one adopted that rule strictly.

The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the weapon of pension sharing contributes to justice and is not a source of additional, avoidable injustice. On that basis, I commend the amendment to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment refers to section 21 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. For many years, that has been the basis of our family law on divorce. There is a clear understanding on the part of the general public, even among those who are not familiar with the law, about how divorce law works, and there is a consensus that it works fairly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sadly, people do get divorced, on the basis of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 and the common law that has been developed by the court, people are aware that if a marriage has existed for some time, and if children are involved, the children must have somewhere to live and must be looked after. Generally, the mother will need to look after them so, generally, the mother must have the house. That should be made clear in the settlement. In his absence, the father must provide sustenance for the children. Therefore, in a sense, neither the house nor the exhusband's salary are personal to him; they need to be used in the divorce settlement to maintain the children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That raises an interesting philosophical point, which my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies) began to share with the Committee. A pension is quite different from the house and the ex-husband's salary. It is a personal asset—something that he has personally built up, not for the present, not in order to look after his wife and children in the present, but for the future. In that respect, the Bill embarks on new territory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that I am not a member of the Front Bench of the shadow Cabinet and therefore not constrained by the principle of collective responsibility, I can answer the question raised by the hon. Member for Gravesham. For reasons that will doubtless become apparent, having considered the provision in Select Committee, I am opposed to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oaten</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that, although a pension is saved for the future, it is similar to other assets because the decision that a couple jointly take on contributions made in their lifetimes impacts on their current spending?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>330</span>
	<p>3 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a sense, the hon. Gentleman is right, but I hope that he will forgive me when I say that the point is somewhat semantic. I do not know what sort of marriage he has, but my wife and I do not spend a great deal of time discussing the exact proportion of my income that will be placed in the occupational pension scheme. Indeed, we have no choice in the matter because the House of Commons deducts the relevant sum from my pay packet, whether I like it or not. I doubt whether such matters are entirely on all fours with the long and spirited conversations that we have about what to feed the children, which house to buy, and so on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that occupational schemes are either non-contributory, or their contribution levels are fixed involuntarily?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exactly. My hon. Friend makes the point that I—rather less effectively—was seeking to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those who promote the Bill, particularly Labour Members, have misunderstood the matter. They seem to think that, in the past, when a couple divorced, the wife was out of pocket because courts took into account the house and the husband's salary, but ignored the wonderful pension accruing in the husband's name. For the purposes of my argument, I am assuming that the husband has the pension. The truth is that courts have for many years taken into account the husband's pension arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the benefit of those who do not believe me, I shall again refer to the mine of information that is the Select Committee report, into which, I suspect, both sides of the argument will dip on many occasions. Like all mines, it contains some gold but a great deal of infill, through which one must dig to reach the gold. Martin Pointer's evidence contains a bit of gold, in that he refers to courts having taken into account the husband's pension arrangements for the past 20 years. On page 55 of the report, he states
	<br><blockquote><p>"there has been a tendency to do the very thing that members of the Committee were expressing concern about—justifying the transfer of the house outright to the wife by reference to the pension fund in the husband's name."</p></blockquote>
He continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I think there can be a lack of fairness…if a pension fund is simply set against a house. If it is a case where there is a wife who is a long-term dependent, she may find herself short of income in retirement"—</p></blockquote>
a fair point, which is often made by Labour Committee members—
	<br><blockquote><p>"but I think that it may lead to a husband receiving a disproportionately low share of the more liquid capital that the parties have built up during the marriage. I do not readily accept the premise that you invite me to accept; that there is necessarily fairness at the time the order is made."</p></blockquote>
Currently, the courts deal with each case individually and have a procedure, which the public understand, for dealing with the house and the husband's income. My worry is that the Bill will lead us into far more complex areas. I hope, as Martin Pointer made clear in the quotation cited by my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford, that the pension-sharing power that courts will have will be low on the list of priorities. I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0652">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>331</span>
hope that they will not automatically assume that, when one gets divorced—we can discuss the expensive associated costs in a moment—one must share out the pension as well. Perhaps the Minister can shed some light on that. That may not be the right way or the fair way to go about things. It may be an over-complicated way of trying to ensure fairness. Therefore, there is nothing wrong with the amendment, which puts the emphasis back on the traditional way of doing things, as set out in section 21 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. Only if that leads to obvious unfairness will the courts proceed down the route that we are discussing in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief in supporting the amendment, but I approach it from a slightly different angle. One must bear in mind the wife who has not worked, who has lived in the matrimonial home and brought the children up. She may, at the time of retirement, have access to very little pension. The hard-hearted would say that she could sell the family home. Quite apart from the emotional argument that it is the family home to which the children would wish to come back, if we are moving into an era of low inflation or even deflation, the proceeds from the sale of the family home would not necessarily be enough to give the wife access to the sort of pension that she might have expected earlier in her life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the spirit of the amendment. If there is a way to obtain a just division of the assets of a marriage, the courts should take that into account first. The amendment does not say that the courts should not take into account the long-term future of the wife's income. I entirely take the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford about the practical difficulty of splitting a pension in the process of accumulation. It is a truism that if one splits a sum, one will not have the same amount of money at the end, if one is working on the basis of compound interest. Although I have great sympathy with my hon. Friend's argument about the problem of dividing a pension in mid-accumulation, there is nothing in the amendment that will stop the courts looking at a wife's long-term income.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric Pickles 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brentwood and Ongar)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief, but after various interventions there is a point that I want to make clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the amendment, because it relates to my earlier intervention about the judgment of Solomon without the happy ending. My concern is that this provision will become habitual and people will just put it into the whole divorce pot. Once the matrimonial home has been disposed of, people will move on to splitting pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Select Committee report outlines the various options available and stresses the need to retain flexibility and to add an extra shot in the locker. It should not be automatic, but should be a means of achieving a fair balance and, if possible, a clean break. However, we must bear in mind that we are dealing with the wreckage of a marriage, with all the pain that is involved. Therefore, it is right that we should offer some guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>332</span>
The conventional view—I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough will not mind if I disagree with him a smidgen—is that one of the couple, usually the wife, has made a number of career decisions so that her husband can get promotion and become a high flier himself which will have a direct effect on the size of his eventual pension. They are sacrifices that we all make in the early years of marriage, and there is a case for that. The stereotype of marriage is that after 20 years, the husband trades his wife in for a new model. She is entitled—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I defend myself? I would not want it to be said that I do not accept that in some circumstances, which the courts can look into at present, where sacrifices have been made, the house is not worth much or the pension is worth a great deal, the pension should be shared. I think that my hon. Friend agrees that the pension should not always be shared. Therefore, we are on all fours.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be a matter of great pain to me if I were to disagree fundamentally with my hon. Friends. That is why I was careful to use the Parliamentary expression "smidgen" That is the stereotype. My concern is that it is probably not the reality in most divorces. I do not want the Bill to affect those receiving low levels of pay, so that, having started the terrible process of cutting the pension in half, we end up with two inadequate shares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 seeks a balance. When a marriage breaks up a balance must be achieved between the parents' pension prospects and long-term financial security and the children's immediate financial needs. I support the amendment, because we must attend to all those matters before we go through the hoop of starting the judgment of Solomon. I am in favour of such matters usually being considered in the family court, but they will mostly be decided in the county court. People going into this process will need some guidance and they should have some expectation of what will come out at the other end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why I support the amendment. It is not because I do not believe in pension sharing as a principle; I certainly do, but I do not want pension sharing to cause further grief and more problems in the wreckage of a marriage, and to shift the balance between the family's long-term security and the children's immediate need for financial security.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kali Mountford 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Colne Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly because I am concerned about Opposition Members' remarks. They seeem to have an old-fashioned view of how family life is developing and how the courts are dealing with divorce. Some of the examples that they have given this afternoon may have been true in the 1970s, but they are not examples that I have seen recently. I know of divorce settlements where the house has been sold to solve the couple's problems. Therefore, it does not seem practical or reasonable not to look at all the family's assets at the same time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about restricting the courts' ability to look at the whole picture. The argument about children is a red herring when we are talking about pensions. If we are considering the family's needs as a whole and we ask
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0653">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>333</span>
the courts to look at all the assets, including the family home, it is not practical to say to the partner who has earned the most and been able to invest in a pension that that asset can remain a personal asset, in which he can continue to invest, ignoring the amount of money in the household to help the children at that time. The partner with the pension can continue to draw on that asset in old age, but the one who had care of the children cannot.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must apologise—I am rather confused by the hon. Lady's comments. It is a reality of life today that the courts have traded off the house for the pension. The wife, who says, "Thank goodness the kids and I have got a roof over our heads," will be left, at the age of 60 or 65, with nothing. The amendment would ensure that the whole picture is taken into account. Pension splitting is not necessarily a good deal for either of the two parties in a marriage, because a split pension does not acquire as much compound interest as a full pension. Both parties will lose out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>3.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kali Mountford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Lady's case, but I do not agree with it. The amendment would restrict the ability to decide what is in a couple's interests because it involves a final result. If a decision has to be made, it should be made in the round rather than as a last resort by the courts. The Opposition should have more confidence in the courts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady has clearly not read the amendment, which makes it plain that the courts can resort to a pension-sharing or to a pension-splitting order if that is required to achieve
	<br><blockquote><p>"a just redistribution of the parties' resources".</p></blockquote>
Its purpose is to enable the courts to use pension-sharing powers when—but only when—that is the only way to achieve a just redistribution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kali Mountford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman tempts me with his use of the phrase "just redistribution". However, we need to examine the schedule and the amendment. He said that the amendment would operate "only when" the end of the process had been reached. I contest that. Why not make the full menu of possibilities available to the courts? I do not know why Opposition Members do not have more faith in the courts, which have developed case law over time to suit today's society rather than the society that we used to have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not realise at the start of our consideration of the schedule how interesting our debate would be. We have exposed a wide diversity of views among Conservative Members. Four Conservative Members are in the Committee today, and we have heard three views—so far—on the subject of feminism, all of them different. The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) has not yet entered the fray, but he has plenty of opportunities to do so. In fact, he may be about to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With your permission, Mr. Malins, I must say that I have decided to be gender neutral on the question of feminism.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>334</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be a fourth position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment, and subsequent amendments to the schedule that Conservative Members have tabled, fall into two groups. They can be helpfully categorised as the Grantham and Stamford amendments and the Beckenham amendments, and they are rather different.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister tell me which amendments I have tabled?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All of the Conservative amendments have been tabled by the same Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Grantham and Stamford amendments adopt the view that pension sharing, which undermines marriage by making it less attractive, is a bad thing and that it is the product of a militant feminist agenda. Those amendments—amendment No. 162, which we are currently considering, is an example—attempt to chip away at the Bill's pension—sharing arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) may not have had a hand in tabling the other group of amendments, which have a different emphasis. That group accepts the principle of pension sharing. Some of those amendments would push the legislation a little further or seek to modify it. Conservative Members should ask themselves whether they support the Grantham and Stamford amendments or the Beckenham amendments, because that may clarify matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arithmetic of the hon. Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) is at fault. There is no difference between the compound interest on two pension shares. If one adds the two shares together, the sum total at the end is the same. The fact that they are divided does not reduce the gains that are produced by the compound interest process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would place restrictions on a court's freedom to use pension—sharing orders in appropriate circumstances. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Colne Valley (Kali Mountford) that there is no reason to restrict that freedom. Pension sharing should not be a court's last resort. Section 25 of the 1973 Act requires the court to consider all the circumstances of a case. It would propose a pension—sharing order only if that were appropriate. The amendment would create another hurdle which the court would need to clear before being able to exercise its powers for the benefit of a divorcing couple. Such a restriction would not be in the interests of those members who prefer their pension to be shared if other significant assets can be kept untouched.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Pension sharing will not be compulsory, but we will restrict the power of the court to reach a fair settlement if we include in statute the need to have a priority order for the treatment of pensions as opposed to other assets. Opposition Members have given no reason why we need a priority order. Setting aside the incorrect assumption about compound interest, their only other point was that the costs involved in pension sharing would make it an unattractive proposition. They suggested that taking the costs of the share-out of the parties, pension funds would disadvantage their long-term financial interests. A couple would usually be given the choice of paying administrative costs that are associated with a split either from the fund or by other means. There is no need for administrative costs to be taken out of the fund if a divorcing couple does not want that to happen. There is,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0654">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>335</span>
therefore, no need to reduce the value of the fund, so the Opposition's weak justification for the amendment falls. The amendment is unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I reply briefly to the hon. Member for Colne Valley, who has fundamentally misunderstood the situation? We need to appreciate what the courts have been doing for the past 20 years. I urge her to read the evidence of Mr. Martin Pointer, the chairman of the Family Law Bar Association. He made it clear that over the past 20 years, the courts have taken pension funds into account. They have not ignored the pension fund, which normally accrues to the husband, or left it out of the equation. The hon. Lady should be aware of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Pointer accepted that there was inadequate understanding of the way in which pension funds work on the part of those who decide such matters. The Bill does not solve that. The only solution is to provide training and to place a greater emphasis on pension sharing. Mr. Pointer made it clear that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the courts have brought pension funds into the scales".</p></blockquote>
I hope that the hon. Lady accepts that because it is important for us to understand the foundation of the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are fundamental misunderstandings about the amendment. One or two hon. Members have not taken the trouble to read it properly. The amendment would allow the court to make a pension-sharing order, when necessary, to achieve a just settlement between parties. It is no use saying that the amendment would prevent the courts from making a just settlement when a just settlement requires a pension-sharing order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other misunderstanding concerns our faith in the courts. Not only do we have faith in them, but we know that they benefit greatly when Parliament sets out clear guidelines on the interpretation of legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A vast amount of court time is spent arguing about what Parliament might or might not have meant. That is frustrating for honest, professional barristers, but perhaps not so frustrating for those who think that prolonging proceedings unnecessarily is an easy way to make money. We do a bad day's work when our intended interpretation of legislation is unclear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the amendment, we are responding directly to the Family Law Bar Association, which said that we should prioritise the new weapon of pension sharing and that we should give it a lower priority than the classical means available to the courts for splitting assets from revenues set out in section 21 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister began by making a good speech and I thought that he was about to make a clever point when he said that Conservatives have tabled two sorts of amendments: the Grantham and Beckenham amendments. My hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham tabled amendments and told the Committee that she had not participated in drafting them, but the Minister's speech lost its point when he was unable to explain what a Beckenham amendment was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All our amendments on pension sharing have been sceptical and restrictive to ensure that the power is not used irresponsibly, wantonly, lightly, automatically or
	<span class='label label-info column'>336</span>
thoughtlessly. One matter that the Minister does not want to talk about, although I have drawn his attention to it, is that we have provided for pension sharing and the existing power of earmarking to be used for the benefit of children. One of the great lacunae in the Government's policy is the sad, irresponsible and either thoughtless or simply inhuman omission of children. I shall have many opportunities to return to that, so I shall not be drawn into the matter now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is fundamentally confused by section 25 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. It is crucial to our debate, so he had better go home tonight with a hot water bottle and read that section again. It sets out the criteria that the courts must have in mind when determining the re-allocation of assets and revenues on divorce. It says nothing about the mechanisms to be used for achieving that redistribution of revenues or assets. There is no point in saying that it is not necessary to prioritise the mechanism for sharing assets because that is covered in section 25, when that is not so. Section 25 refers to something quite different: to the considerations that the courts must have in mind when considering the proportion of any redistribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 21 sets out the instruments available to a court to make that redistribution—periodical payments, lump-sum payments or property splitting, to which I have already referred. If the Bill is passed, a further pension sharing instrument will be added. Therefore, should we not prioritise in section 21 rather than section 25? If the range of instruments available for splitting the assets and revenues of parties to a marriage that has broken down is to be increased, the answer should be yes. The Bill should state that the new instrument is a reserve auxiliary power, which is to be used only in circumstances where it is necessary to achieve justice. That is the purpose of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
3.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we progress through the parts of the Bill—or even the schedule—that relate to pension sharing, you will notice, Mr. Malins, that there is a logic and coherence to all our amendments. There can be no doubt about our position. We are cautiously willing to provide the courts with an additional remedy, if Parliament establishes protections to ensure that the new remedy is not abused and that it is not used except in circumstances where it is necessary to achieve justice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The amendment would ensure that there would be only one opportunity to make a pension sharing order. It changes new section 24C, which is to be inserted into the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. If amended, new section 24C(4) would read
	<br><blockquote><p>"No pension sharing order may be made under section 24B above after a divorce order has been made, except in response to an application made before the divorce order was made".</p></blockquote>

The amendment is based on the principle that one can have only one shot at a pension-sharing arrangement. The Government cannot have it both ways. They cannot argue—as they have done, and, I suspect, will continue to do—that a pension-sharing arrangement is a clean-break arrangement that, once made, is irrevocable and requires no further communication between the parties concerned or their lawyers, while also leaving open the possibility of a subsequent application for a pension-sharing order after the initial divorce order is made. What is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander. It would be wrong for the party with a pension that may be subject to sharing to be unclear at the time that the divorce order is made, whether a subsequent pension-sharing arrangement could be sought against him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

Whether or not that risk exists, should the two parties fail to agree, it would be fundamentally unfair for the assets and revenues available to them to be settled or redistributed by the courts and for a subsequent, additional pension-sharing order to be made. That would upset the balance of the initial redistribution arrangement. Divorce settlements, whether they proceed by agreement or by court imposition—one hopes that, in future, more will proceed by agreement—are a package. According to criteria set out in section 25 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, such settlements attempt to bring about a just redistribution of assets. If that redistribution is just, by definition, the balance cannot, be unsettled by a subsequent pension-sharing order without the redistribution ceasing to be just.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should be no doubt about the fact that a pension-sharing arrangement can be established only at the time when the divorce order is made. If a couple do not ask for pension sharing at that point and therefore do not get it, that is too bad—it is the end of the story. The couple cannot have a second bite at the cherry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To revert to the point that I made earlier in another context, we want to avoid unnecessary and vexatious litigation. We do not want people to find—and both parties would be involved—that they have to run up legal bills that should not have arisen. After a divorce order has been made, someone may make a pension-sharing application. There will be a second round of legal negotiation and legal argument before the court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is probably about to say "Ah, but the Government's text says that a subsequent application may be made only 'with the leave of the court'." We are about to hear another paean of praise for the English court system and the superior wisdom of judges. Ironically, it is Parliament which has responsibility for creating the rules within which the courts operate, so if the courts go wrong and there are abuses at that point, it is ultimately our fault.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are no doubt about to argue that it is wrong to restrict the freedom of the courts in this way. That is not right. The possibility that a subsequent application can be made with the leave of a court is an open invitation to lawyers to make such applications. They may have no merit, but hearing the evidence could take a long time, with enormous legal costs on both sides. I dare say that there are cynical, or less than austerely professional, lawyers who may not object to the prospect of enormous amounts of additional litigation being generated by that open-ended invitation. It is something that Parliament should provide not for, but against, when it foresees a danger. That is the purpose of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment will ensure that no pension-sharing order can be made except in response to an application made before the divorce order. Therefore, the application for pension sharing will be available to the court when a divorce order is made and could be considered alongside applications for redistribution of other assets—what the 1973 Act calls periodic payments but others call alimony or, in the popular jargon, maintenance—and alongside demands for lump sums, the split of property assets, houses, race horses, yachts or whatever else may be available— [	<i>Interruption.</i>] The Minister and his right

hon. and hon. Friends have many friends who own yachts and race horses, so I thought that that was a pertinent point. However, I can see, Mr. Malins, that you do not want me to increase the Minister's embarrassment by going further in that direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment is that all the relevant applications should be available and should be considered by the court when the divorce order is made and that the court must take into account the whole package as a coherent, integral whole. No pension-sharing application should be entertained thereafter, not even with the leave of the court, because the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"with the leave of the court"</p></blockquote>
is an invitation to open-ended and, in many cases, gratuitous and unnecessary litigation. It is Parliament's responsibility to avoid that, not least because the reputation of our legal system in the eyes of the public—no legal system can maintain its legitimacy indefinitely if it does not have public support—can be damaged by the perception that a large amount of litigation is either vexatious or disproportionate to the cause at issue or that, in the case of financial litigation, the costs are disproportionate to the value of the amounts being litigated. We do not want to contribute to that perception. I do not want to comment on the extent to which the problem exists, but we do not want to add to it and it is Parliament's responsibility to ensure that that does not happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that all Committee members have witnessed in constituency surgeries the results of unhappy divorces. One or other party to the divorce comes to see us because he or she wants to go back to court. Often, such cases involve access to the children. They might involve the financial settlement and changes in circumstances. In many cases, there is much bitterness, grief and emotion. Pensions, which people tend to think will apply far off in the future, should be taken away from the rest of the misery that often accompanies a divorce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If someone agrees to a settlement involving pension splitting 10, 20 or 30 years ahead, that should be the final settlement. Otherwise, vexatious litigation could be involved, and we might meet another category of constituents in our surgeries. They would want our help to sort out a pension-splitting agreement, although I should have great difficulty feeling sympathy about a decision that would apply many years in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to get into an arithmetical debate with the Minister, but he confused simple with compound interest. I did a quick calculation under what I understand to be the Scottish system of compound interest and I found that there was a difference between the two lump sums. However, there was not a difference if simple interest was involved. Perhaps the Minister and I should compare our methods of calculating compound interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consultation document sets out three clear priorities: to increase flexibility of choice, which we discussed earlier; to ensure the fairest settlement overall; and to try to facilitate a clean-break divorce. Re-visiting a pension settlement some years after a divorce will not facilitate a clean-break divorce; it will only add to the possibility of litigation. My hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham referred to constituency surgeries, which I prefer to call my advice bureaux. The very first case that I handled was a matrimonial matter, but when the gentleman came to see me, I found him taking his trousers off, so I always avoid use of the term "surgeries" just in case people get the wrong idea. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I promise that that is not fictitious or even a slight exaggeration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem with divorce is that the acrimony goes on for ever. Constituents have come to visit me years after a divorce, complaining about the court and wanting to make applications. I believe that one constituent was judged to be a frivolous litigant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If pension sharing is available, people will want their cases to be reconsidered—perhaps with good reason because they suddenly discover other assets to be taken into account, but it might just be to continue to score points. In terms of the three clear policy aims of the Government and, I think, the Select Committee, this provision runs a coach and horses through the concept of a clean-break divorce.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham got me thinking, as her contributions often do when she said that we were talking about something that might be relevant many years in the future. I wonder whether those on both sides of the argument are not getting matters out of proportion. From personal
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0657">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>341</span>
experience, it seems to me—I do not have the figures to hand—that a high proportion of divorces take place in the earlier years of marriage. Therefore, the parties are relatively young—in their 30s—and the amount of pension that has accrued to them is a relatively small part of their capital compared with the equity in their house or their income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the pension is a relatively small sum, the courts might not consider it worth sharing because the sums accrued are insufficient. I do not need to labour that point because it has been well made by my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) in his judgment of Solomon point. If the courts consider the issue in that way, surely it would be wise for there to be a firm presumption in favour of a clean-break settlement, so that the courts deal with the matter once, and once only, when the parties are in their 30s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument is somewhat different in the case of a longer marriage. If couples divorce in their 50s, the amount accrued in the pension fund might be very large indeed—in the case of a typical occupational pension, anything up to £300,000. That does not affect the validity of the amendment because, in that case, the amount in the pension fund will be clear to the court, and it will be easy for the court to make a settlement at that stage and not to allow one of the parties to come back on a subsequent occasion—indeed, there might not be much time in which to come back to court if the couple are both in their 50s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if the couple are in their 30s, is it not wise to make it absolutely clear to the courts that if the amount of money is relatively small, it should be dealt with then, and the parties should not be given an opportunity to come back to court at a later stage?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, may I thank you, Mr. Malins, for clarifying the response to my earlier intervention. I had not spotted that there has been a change in the way the amendment appears on the amendment paper since Tuesday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would restrict the power of the court to make a pension-sharing order after divorce if application had been made before divorce. That would remove a flexibility that should be included. It would take no account of those circumstances—admittedly limited—in which an application could not be made before the divorce order went through. For example, one member of the couple might have been seriously ill or the victim of domestic violence at the hands of the other; alternatively, it might not be possible to locate one member of the couple. In all of those cases, the court can make a divorce order under section 9 of the Family Law Act 1996 before being satisfied that parties have made their financial arrangements for the future. That flexibility is allowed in the current legislation and it must be retained in the schedule under discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister read out some clear and specific examples of the need for flexibility. To ensure that this issue is not raised time and again, would it not be better to specify the areas in which that flexibility is needed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>342</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those examples are in the Family Law Act 1996. They are not in the schedule, but they do not need to be. Given the existing legislation, that can be left to the court. The exceptions are not catered for by the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister knows, parts of the Family Law Act 1996 are not yet in force. Are the relevant provisions of that Act in force?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure. The Government intend that the whole of that legislation will be in force by the end of 2000.I understand that section 9 is in that category and is intended to be brought into force next year. Therefore, it is not currently in force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Gentleman that the power should be used with care. Under the Bill, if a former spouse wished to make an application for a pension-sharing order after the granting of the divorce, he or she would need to obtain the leave of the court. That would prevent a former spouse from attempting to re-open the financial settlement for trivial reasons, about which Opposition Members are understandably concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill strikes the right balance between restricting the opportunity for parties to reopen a previously settled financial arrangement and the need to allow for those cases in which an application for pension sharing after a divorce order is proper. It is sometimes important to end a marriage without delay—especially where domestic violence has occurred—and it would be wrong to prevent that happening, as the amendment effectively would, until the financial arrangements had been finalised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On that basis, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment. If not, I would urge the Committee to resist it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not entirely persuaded, but I am prepared to be. The Minister should go into greater detail about the situations where it might be necessary to provide for a subsequent application for a pension-sharing order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister gave the example of domestic violence. Of course, domestic violence might be the ground for divorce, but why should that require the pension-sharing order to be made subsequent to the divorce settlement? When an application is made for divorce, and one of the grounds is domestic violence, the court should take into account all the financial resources of the two parties and reach what it considers is a just settlement. If a pension-sharing order is required to be part of that settlement, it should be brought forward at that point. I cannot see why the ground for divorce that he cited—domestic violence—is relevant to whether a pension-sharing order should be used or when it should be promulgated. If he can explain the reason convincingly, we might support him. If he cannot, we will not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall have to have a go. The hon. Gentleman is missing the point that in some circumstances it is important to allow the divorce order to be made quickly and not to delay it pending resolution of the financial arrangements. That is recognised in the Family Law Act, but would not be possible with the

amendment. The pension share application would have to be in place before the divorce order was made. Such a requirement would be wrong.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the sitting was suspended, the Minister said that parts of the 1996 Act had not been brought into effect. When will that happen? Are there other exemptions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be helpful if the Minister got into the habit of answering the question. Before we rose for tea, he said that we need to provide for applications for pension-sharing orders to be considered by a court after a divorce in the case of domestic violence. I said that that was interesting and asked why domestic violence, which is simply one ground for divorce, should affect the timing of the application for a pension-splitting order. He failed to address that, and we will not make any progress until he does.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did answer that question, but I shall endeavour to do so again to the hon. Gentleman's satisfaction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are circumstances, including domestic violence, in which it is important to make a divorce order quickly and where it is inappropriate to require the financial arrangements to be sorted out before the divorce order is made. The priority in such cases is that the divorce order is reached quickly. The amendment would slow down the process until all financial arrangements were made and an application for a pension split was in place. That would not be appropriate in cases with a history of domestic violence where it is important that the divorce order is reached quickly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a reason for allowing financial settlements for a divorce to be made after the divorce order. Will the Minister accept a jointly drafted
	<span class='label label-info column'>344</span>
amendment—he can draft it on his own if he prefers—on Report or in another place to provide for the court to have the power to entertain and accept applications for financial settlements after divorce? His arguments may be equally germane to other aspects of a financial settlement apart from a pension. The Minister has failed to make a case for a special provision to enable courts to receive applications for a pension split. The clause allows the provision to delay the financial settlement in exceptional cases, such as those outlined by the Minister, until after the divorce order has been made. In other words, in exceptional circumstances, courts will be allowed to make a divorce order before the financial settlement has been arranged, which contradicts the general principle set out in the 1973 Act. There may be exceptions, but I am not persuaded that they are specific to the pension-sharing issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The arrangement that the hon. Gentleman is—I think—suggesting is already dealt with in the Family Law Act 1996.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If anything, the confusion is on the Government's side. If the 1996 Act does provide for all aspects of financial settlement in exceptional circumstances to be considered after a divorce order is made, why do we need the clause? All the Government need to do is to bring into force the 1996 Act—as the Minister acknowledged, they have yet to do so—and the problems would be resolved. Indeed, the problems associated with all aspects of financial settlement would be resolved equally. That would be preferable to resolving, in advance of the enforcement of the 1996 Act, only those problems associated with pension-sharing orders. That would bring with it all the disadvantages that I have outlined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I imagine, Mr. Malins, that you are reluctant that this discussion should continue for much longer. The amendment would remove flexibility in the precise instance of pension splitting that we are discussing. I do not know why the hon. Gentleman is resisting that point. It would be inappropriate to remove flexibility from this part of the settlement, given that the 1996 Act provides flexibility for other parts of the financial arrangement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By your leave, Mr. Malins, may I have just two more sentences? The worst that the Minister can say about the amendment is that it duplicates provisions that will come into force when the 1996 Act comes into force. In other words, the amendment would provide for circumstances for which the 1996 Act will provide. Therefore, at worst, the amendment is a duplication; at best, it would remove an anomaly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By leave of the Committee, I wonder whether I might approach the matter from the other angle. I support the thinking behind the amendment, but I also accept the Minister's point about exceptions such as domestic violence. I wonder whether it would be better if the Bill dealt with such exceptions. As it stands, it would allow a clever divorce lawyer—of whom there are plenty—to drive a coach and horses through its intentions.

	<span class='label label-info column'>345</span>
Pensions have got into difficulties, in part because courts and lawyers have cleverly managed to build up case law to such an extent that there is a trade-off between the house and the pension fund. The Bill will allow those lawyers to return time and again to the pension share. I accept the need for exclusions, but the amendment would prevent such circumstances from arising. Perhaps the Minister should go away and think about the matter along those lines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also accept the need for exemptions and I agree that the Minister's argument was reasonable, but I want to explain a fairly simple point. As I understand what the Minister said, when the 1996 Act comes into being, all the other aspects of divorce will be placed on the same level as the schedule places them: in exceptional circumstances, the court will be able to go back and reconsider. Why is pension sharing not covered by that Act, if it is a natural extension? Why does the Minister need something specific in the Bill? Why can it not rest on the 1996 Act?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Members for Brentwood and Ongar and for Beckenham. There is some agreement between us at least about the need for flexibility. However, pension sharing is not in the 1996 Act; it is only in the Bill. The amendment would require a pension-splitting application to be made before a divorce order. I think that most of us now agree that it would be inappropriate to require that in certain instances. As all the arrangements for pension splitting are in the Bill—the concept is not in the Family Law Act—we cannot leave it to that Act to obtain the flexibility that we need, particularly as the amendment removes flexibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Beckenham asked whether we should set out in the schedule the precise circumstances in which we envisage this flexibility being applied. It is a matter of judgment how much we set down in the Bill or in regulations, and how much we allow the courts to decide for themselves. Our judgment is that situation may arise that we have not thought of in advance—for example, where a pension comes to light only after the divorce order, which is not covered by the Family Law Act—and we need to allow the courts to exercise flexibility in such circumstances. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we have thought of all the circumstances in which the provision would be appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason why I sought to catch your eye again, Mr. Malins, was that the Minister has adduced a new argument that is in danger of seriously confusing the Committee. I do not know whether he has done it deliberately or whether it reflects his own confusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>346</span>
The Minister said that the 1996 Act does not provide the protection that we seek because it makes no mention of a pension-sharing order. There is complete confusion there. In the Minister's own words, the 1996 Act provides that the financial settlement for a divorce can in certain circumstances, by leave of the court, take place after the court has made a divorce order and a pronouncement about the divorce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Pension sharing is only one of the range of financial arrangements that courts will have at their disposal if the Bill goes through. At present, a range is set out in section 21. If it is true, as the Minister said, that the 1996 Act provides for the totality of financial arrangements to be established after the divorce has been granted in the exceptional circumstances that he describes, by definition, once the Bill is law, that will include pension sharing. It is no use the Minister having assured me, earlier in the debate, that I do not need my amendment to achieve the stated purpose because it will be achieved by the 1996 Act when it comes into force and then, in answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham a few minutes later, producing the reverse argument. That confuses the Committee. The Minister must decide what argument he wishes to make, so that the Committee can take it into account in deciding how to vote on my amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would add the word "previous" before the word "pension" in line 48 of the schedule on page 69 of the Bill, and amendment No. 154 would remove the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"in relation to the marriage".</p></blockquote>
You reasonably and properly decided, Mr. Malins, that related consequential amendments, which deal with other aspects of divorce and nullity in relation to a pension-sharing order, should be grouped with the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would have a fundamental and simple effect: it would allow a pension to be split only once. It would not have the same effect as the Government's proposal, which will allow a pension to be split only once in favour of the same ex-spouse. The amendment would make it impossible to split a pension more than once in favour of anyone. We have said all along that the power should be regarded by the courts as a reserve power. It is a rather special power—it involves special risks and costs and it could involve injustice and unfairness. It should be exercised cautiously and with considerable consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other contexts, we argued that no pension should be subject to the double or triple—or even more than triple—jeopardy of being split on several occasions. A sad aspect of the modern world is that 40 per cent. of marriages end in divorce. The majority of people who get divorced also re-marry and it is not unusual for people to go through two, three or even four divorce settlements. In that context, it would be inappropriate for the courts to focus on a particular percentage—the percentage should vary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much of the Select Committee's consideration of the Bill was premised on the assumption that a typical split would be 50 per cent. of a pension. One does not need to be a mathematical genius or to have attended a Scottish grammar school to work out that if one starts off with a pension that is worth 100 per cent., it will be worth 50 per cent. to the person who earned it after the first split, 25 per cent. after the next split and 12.5 per cent. after the third split. In that situation, a person who expected to have a reasonable income on retirement would find that he had one eighth, not only of what he expected to have but of what his employer expected him to have—in the case of an occupational pension scheme—given his period of service for that employer. It would also be an
	<span class='label label-info column'>348</span>
eighth of what the state might have expected him to have when it considered whether he might require state assistance in old age, such as income support or other means-tested benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arithmetic is not that simple; it is even worse. As I explained, the costs of splitting will be proportionately significant—they will be in reverse relation to the value of the pension to be split. If the costs are a few thousand pounds and the pension has a cash equivalent transfer value of £500,000 or £1 million, the costs may be relatively modest in relation to the value of the asset being split. The costs are likely to be fixed—professional advice will be required because it will be difficult to decide on a fair value for a pension and many legal arguments will be adduced. As I pointed out, the Government have provided many opportunities for otiose legal arguments and disputes. That could be extremely significant—indeed, it could be onerous—in relation to more modest pension values. My figure of 100 per cent.—which will decrease to 50 per cent., then 25 per cent., then 12.5 per cent.—overstates the amount of money that will be left in the hands of the man or woman who was the original pension scheme member. At each stage, a significant sum will be abstracted in costs, and the whole pension-splitting exercise will become increasingly problematic the more often it is undertaken in relation to a particular pension.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oaten</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To help me to understand the logic of the hon. Gentleman's argument, is it logical to conclude that the rights of the second wife would be less than the rights of the first wife? Would not the rights of the second wife to have the same settlement on divorce as the first wife disappear?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may have a small prize. He has successfully understood the logic of my argument and has successfully anticipated one of the points that I am about to make. I am glad that he is listening to what I am saying. There have been moments when I have had the impression that non Conservative Committee members have not listened attentively, as they have asked questions that have already been answered. Perhaps they do so to prolong proceedings artificially. The hon. Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mrs. McKenna) asked a question, which I had answered half an hour or so before, simply because she was recovering from lunch. She joined us again mentally later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Winchester correctly understood my point and anticipated my conclusion, which I shall explain and justify. In the circumstances that I have described, in which there is a prospect of erosion of pension value to insignificant amounts, someone who could have expected a comfortable income in retirement because of his or her work record might be thrust on to the state welfare system and forced to depend on means-tested benefits in retirement. That will affect people's behaviour because they will anticipate that situation. Someone in that situation is unlikely to continue to contribute to a pension scheme because they will simply deprive themselves of the prospect of means-tested benefits. They will no longer be above that threshold, to which I have referred during our previous
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0661">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>349</span>
debates on stakeholder pensions, below which it makes no sense to save. That would be a pity because it would mean that fewer people would provide for their pension, which is the opposite of the Government's declared policy, and certainly the opposite of the sincere commitment of the Conservative party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Winchester said that if the Bill provides that a pension can be split only once, then second, third, fourth and subsequent wives will not have the same rights. I quite agree with him; that follows as logically as night follows day, and I see no harm in it. Under our proposals, a second, third or subsequent spouse will know before he or she embarks on marriage that the pension is not there and cannot be split. He or she will know the score.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be wrong retrospectively to change people's prospective incomes, whether in marriage or in divorce, but it is not wrong to make provision for subsequent marriages. Those who are currently married will benefit from this if they become divorced. I personally find that phrase uncomfortable because I do not think people benefit from divorce as it is a very sad occurrence. Nevertheless, they will be in a position to claim pension-sharing rights. However, there is absolutely no reason why subsequent spouses of the same pensioner should not be told in advance that they will not so benefit. It is entirely reasonable to make such a provision. Indeed, only if we make such a provision will those who embark on further marriages be likely to have any incentive—unless their incomes are extremely high—to make any pension provision at all. Those who are not compelled to do so for one reason or another, perhaps because they are not in a non-contributory scheme, will not do so, and that will be dangerous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oaten</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to clarify the amendment. The consequence of the amendment would be that the wife of a first marriage, which lasted for two years, would be entitled to the pension, whereas the wife of a second marriage, which lasted 15 years, would not. That is illogical and entirely unfair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman is coming round to our view that the pension-sharing project could produce enormous unfairness. If it be true—this is the assumption behind the hon. Gentleman's intervention—that someone who was married for two years would be able to walk away with a significant share of a spouse's pension, that would be an appalling injustice. It is precisely to avoid such a situation that we are determined that, if the power is given to the courts at all, it should be exercised only in special circumstances where it is necessary to share the pension in order for justice to be done. In those circumstances, no one would be able to argue that the pension must be shared in order for justice to be done. However, if pension sharing is introduced, and if jurisprudence develops in such a way that everyone automatically gets 50 per cent. of whatever is there, then exactly the situation described by the hon. Gentleman could arise. That would be unjust and damaging. Unless Liberal Members believe that that situation would be amusing, I hope that they will support both this and other amendments, which all have a similar
	<span class='label label-info column'>350</span>
purpose of ensuring that the power is not abused and does not produce the kind of cruel anomaly that has been described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to the rights of second and third wives—or second and third husbands—the Government will find themselves in a frightful mess whatever route they take, unless they accept our amendment. The courts may decide that the same proportion of split is appropriate, irrespective of the number of times that the pension has been attacked and reduced by a pension-sharing order. In that event someone who has the misfortune to have had two or three marriages, who has not worked and has absolutely no pension, may fall on the state at the end of his working life. He would be foolish to make any pension provision for himself, as that makes it more likely that he will fall on the state. That is one possibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The alternative is that the courts develop the jurisprudence of in practice not giving the second and subsequent spouse the same share. The first spouse goes along and gets 50 per cent. and then the court considers the second one's position and says, "The husband's pension prospects have already been so drastically reduced by the first pension-sharing order that we made against him that it would not be fair to take another 50 per cent., taking him down to 25 per cent. After all, he has earned his pension"—there probably will be some judges who think like that—"so we shall give her only 30 per cent." On the third occasion they may say that they will give her only 20 per cent. Therefore, even though the conduct of the parties, the duration of the marriage and all the other factors set out in section 25 of the 1973 Act are comparable in all three cases, in practice the jurisprudence is moving towards not giving subsequent spouses the same rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has a problem unless he accepts our amendment. Either it will no longer be open to him to argue that all spouses should have equal rights, irrespective of the number of marriages—in practice the courts will not deliver that, so there will not be such a regime—or this pension-sharing power will lead to the completely inequitable treatment of people who have worked honestly for their pension and find themselves impoverished in retirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is necessary to provide that additional protection and prevent an abuse of pension sharing that will have unhappy human consequences. Unless the Minister produces some clear arguments, we shall have to pursue our amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is one of the more bizarre proposals on the amendment paper. The hon. Gentleman proposes that second marriages should be legally inferior to first marriages, a strange idea and not one that hon. Members on either side of the Committee would seriously entertain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 75 attempts to prevent a pension-sharing order in relation to a pension arrangement that has already been the subject of a pension-sharing order, as the hon. Gentleman explained. The Bill already prevents a former spouse from benefiting from a pension share in relation to a particular
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0662">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>351</span>
pension arrangement and then returning to court to seek a second pension share in respect of that arrangement. The amendment will therefore prevent pension sharing by order by a second or subsequent spouse, not by the first spouse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two main objections to the amendment. I do not see the case for different rules for first and second spouses. Clearly some issues arise about the amount that is available in the pension fund, but that applies to the first or second time round in the same way. It is an issue that the court needs to take into account. To say that the rules should be different simply because it is a second spouse is not a case that many members of the Committee would accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the amendment would limit the member spouse's scope for negotiation. Member spouses might prefer their pensions to be divided for a second time, perhaps to achieve a clean break—especially if they want to remarry—or to keep some other asset untouched. The amendment would limit the court's ability to make a fair financial settlement in England and Wales by removing an option which could be a significant benefit. The proposal would not be helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the concern that pension sharing might reduce pension rights to the point where a person would be incapable of supporting himself in retirement. That is why the law explicitly requires the court to have regard to income, earning capacity, property and other resources that each party is likely to have in the foreseeable future. The court would have to take account of a second share of a pension if it jeopardised a person's ability to support himself. For example, it is unlikely that the court would make a pension—sharing order for a person who is close to retirement or drawing a pension unless it was satisfied that the person had sufficient resources to support himself adequately in retirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would also be open to the court to avoid pension sharing—a negotiated agreement is the other route by which this could be done—if the administrative costs of sharing, however reasonable, take a disproportionate amount out of the pension. But that would apply equally to first, second or subsequent splits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 152, 155, 157 and 159 deal largely with that matter. Amendments Nos. 154, 156, 158 and 160 would remove the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"in relation to the marriage"</p></blockquote>
from various provisions in the Bill. Those words are included to prevent a former spouse from obtaining more than one share of a member's pension arrangements or state scheme rights. We do not, however, want to prevent a subsequent spouse from sharing a member's pension arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 168 and 169 would limit the power of the court in connection with earmarking orders relating to lump sums. The court's power to make such an order would not be exercisable if a pension arrangement was subject to a pension—sharing order or had been the subject of a pension—sharing order or an agreement. Although the amendments seek to protect the value of a member's pension fund, they would
	<span class='label label-info column'>352</span>
unacceptably limit the options available to the court to assist a subsequent spouse. There is no reason to exclude the lump sum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would apply—no doubt unintentionally—only to pension-sharing orders in England and Wales. Pension-sharing arrangements that are contained in an agreement—rather than an order—between a divorcing couple would not be affected. I am sure that that is an accidental feature of the drafting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not an accidental feature of the drafting. We shall deal with Scotland when we debate clause 16. As for the agreement, we do not want to prevent people from making whatever agreements they want to make. This is a free society. So long as there is no fraud or exploitation, consenting adults who are reasonably advised should be able to decide how to split their assets on divorce, or for any other purpose. Why should the law prevent us from giving half our property to someone else if that is what we have agreed to do? We do not intend to limit the freedom of people to reach agreements, but we are concerned about imposing a pension-sharing order on a reluctant victim. That is where protections are required.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it is all right to impose a pension—sharing order by agreement, why is it not all right for a court to require it? I am at a loss to understand that argument. What little basis there was for the hon. Gentleman's amendment has disappeared. The rationale throughout the Bill for the pension—splitting proposal is that if a court decides that that is the fairest way in which to divide the asset, it should be able to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened to what the Minister said about Scotland. Will pension sharing be different in Scotland, or will it be the same throughout the United Kingdom? I thought that Scottish law was slightly different and that it covered only assets that accrue during marriage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Family law is different in Scotland. The aim of the Bill is to ensure that the arrangements for pension splitting are as common as they can be to avoid undue complications for people who operate pension schemes in England and Wales as well as Scotland. No amendment on the amendment paper would change the arrangements in Scotland in the same way as the amendments before us would change them in England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have demonstrated that the amendments would remove a necessary flexibility. It will be not used in all cases and I have no doubt that the courts will consider carefully the circumstances raised by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point about Scotland is interesting. I was attracted to the Scottish solution and tried to persuade my colleagues on the Select Committee that we should move towards the arrangements in Scotland, which are closer to an equal split, but I was told that the Bill would be the wrong vehicle for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister emphasised that the courts will be able to take account of the fact that if they are considering a subsequent divorce and a small pension fund, it might not be worth insisting on pension sharing. I need the help
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0663">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>353</span>
of the hon. Member for Gravesham, if he could stop dealing with his correspondence for one moment. I have searched the Select Committee evidence because the Institute of Actuaries or the National Association of Pension Funds, in reply to a question asked by the hon. Gentleman, gave some facts and figures. It would be useful if the Committee could be reminded of the state of someone's pension fund on an actuarial basis after four or five years' marriage, followed by divorce, remarriage, and divorce again 10 years later. I am not a mathematician or an actuary, but the hon. Member for Gravesham gave some interesting figures and perhaps he will help me out. I think that he said that in such a situation, only a tiny proportion of the fund would be available—I see that the hon. Gentleman is trying to attract my attention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been listening carefully to everything that the hon. Gentleman and other hon. Members have said. My recollection of that evidence is that the sum was paltry. The hon. Member for Gainsborough will remember that the Committee cast doubt on the validity of the sum because account was not taken of inflation or change in income over time. We should be careful in using that example.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is interesting and I remember now that during our discussions the hon. member for Gravesham made that point. I have great respect for the hon. Gentleman, but actuaries, who train for five years, and representatives of the National Association of Pension Funds, have considerable expertise, which we cannot match. If they warn us along those lines, we should heed their warnings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was reassured by the Minister's comment that the courts will have to examine the matter carefully. We could be embarking on a dangerous course and ensuring that people's pension funds are rendered valueless, as my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford would say. People would he pushed down to a level where they would be better off seeking income support and not making any provision for their retirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has shown in his comments that he is seized of this point. I only hope that when judges read 	<i>Hansard,</i> as they will, following on from the finding in Pepper v. Hart, they will carefully note what the Minister has said today and will see it as the will of Parliament that judges should be flexible in this matter and should ensure that, if they insist on pension sharing, both shares are sensible and viable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some difficulty with the Bill precisely because of the point that my hon. Friends the Members for Grantham and Stamford and for Gainsborough have made. The pension fund at the end of the working life of someone who could be described as a serial marrier will be very small. I suspect that there will be a growth in pre-nuptial agreements, whatever the potential income of the new spouses, in order to protect the diminishing pension fund accruing to either partner.
	<span class='label label-info column'>354</span>
Even though the courts will have to take into account the effect of another pension share or pension fund, a growth in pre-nuptial agreements may be an unintended consequence of the Bill. It might inform our discussions if the Minister would tell us whether he would wish to see a growth in pre-nuptial agreements or whether the Government would set their face against it, whether they would allow couples to make their own decisions and how pre-nuptial agreements would fit into the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has presented the Committee with one of the most memorable pieces of nonsense that I have heard in a long time. Even he, after a few minutes' reflection, which he has presumably had time for, will almost certainly recognise that. He said that if something could be permitted to take place by agreement, there was no reason why the same thing should not be enforceable by law. That is equivalent to saying that if the Minister can give me half his capital with his agreement, as he can if he wants to—I do not suppose he will—there is no reason why the law should not compel something of the kind to take place. That is manifestly absurd. In a free society we allow anything and everything to be done by agreement between individuals, unless there are specified circumstances why it should not happen. We certainly do not say that all the things that can be done by agreement between adults should be enforced in law, which is the logic of what the Minister was saying. I cannot imagine that even he will want to pursue that line for long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have another problem with the Minister's argument. He presented himself as being rather shocked by my suggestion that the amendment would create differential legal rights between first and subsequent spouses. Of course it would. He then said that he accepted that there was an issue about the amount that would remain in someone's pension fund if it was subject to more than one split. As I explained in my opening remarks on the amendment, that means in practice that the courts will decide that, whatever percentage split is appropriate for a first marriage and a first pension split, given the duration of the marriage and the other section 25 criteria, the same percentage is not appropriate in the case of subsequent splits. Therefore, de facto, a distinction will be made between first and second marriages.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman argues an illogical case. The purpose of including pensions in marital assets at the point of divorce is to take account of the broad spread of assets that can appropriately be divided. He argues that the pension could diminish further with each subsequent marriage, but what of other assets? Suppose that a former spouse burnt down the family home, which was not fully insured, in a fit of rage. In such a circumstance, second and subsequent spouses would receive a smaller share than before, because that would also be an asset to be divided in the divorce.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman make my case for me? Subsequent spouses of an individual whose first spouse burnt down the marital home would know that the home was no longer available and would not be misled into marrying in the expectation of acquiring half of it through a subsequent divorce. That is precisely my point about pension splits: subsequent and prospective
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0664">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>355</span>
spouses would know the rules of the game at the outset. They would have to accept that, because the pension had already been shared with an earlier spouse, the pension would not be available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put it to the Minister that, if our amendment is not accepted—although I remain of an optimistic bent—we face two choices. First, as my hon. Friend the member for Gainsborough said, in multiple marriage cases, which are increasing, pension splitting will so deplete the pension that, even in cases where an employee works hard for 40 years, and both he and his employer make contributions in the expectation of a reasonable standard of living in retirement, the employee will end up subsisting on public welfare. For various reasons that we have discussed, that is an unacceptable prospect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Alternatively, as the Minister argued, the courts would decide by jurisprudence that that should not happen, and would use section 25 to reduce the shares available to subsequent spouses, irrespective of the duration of the respective marriages or the conduct of the parties. De facto, there would be discrimination and subsequent spouses would be disadvantaged. The logic of that, which the Minister has accepted, is inexorable. The amendment would save the Government from that dilemma.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Gravesham has failed to persuade me that the amendment's logic is not robust. Indeed, his comments, which went down the very road that I predicted, have proved otherwise. On that basis, I am emboldened to invite my colleagues to vote for the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 153, in page 69, line 51, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(c) or has been the subject of an earmarking order."</p></blockquote>
The amendment would add a new paragraph (c) to new section 24C(5), at the bottom of page 69, which will be inserted into the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. It would prevent pension splitting in cases where the pension had already been subject to an earmarking order. To some extent, the amendment is necessary for the same reasons as the previous set of amendments. A pension may be subject de facto to the same depredation and reduction in its value by virtue of an earmarking order as it would as a result of a pension-sharing order. If pension-sharing orders should apply only once to any pension, it seems right and proper that the same protection should be provided when a pension has been subject to an earmarking order. A pension could therefore only be attacked once, whether by the earmarking or splitting procedure. As two alternatives will be available to the courts if the Bill is enacted, it seems sensible that the same provision and the same protection should apply to both, for the benefit of the party who earned the pensions. I trust that the arguments that I adduced in relation to the previous group of amendments will be fresh in Committee members' minds and that I do not need to repeat them, although they are equally relevant in this context. Perhaps I will score some credit with you, Mr. Malins, by that act of self-denial. It might be difficult even for you to argue that I should not repeat them. However, I shall not do so in the hope that I shall score some increase in whatever credit—or a reduction in whatever debit—I have in your books. The effect will be the same.

An additional anomaly will arise if the amendment is not accepted. A former spouse who is already the beneficiary of an earmarking order may subsequently remarry and divorce. If the pension, in respect of which the earmarking order has been made and out of which the income that the court has assigned to the wife is being paid, is itself subject to a subsequent pension-sharing order, only one of two alternatives will result. If the Minister can think of a third, fourth or fifth alternative, I hope that he will tell us about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first alternative is that the pension split will reduce retrospectively the value of the earmarking order that has been made in favour of the first wife. That would be thoroughly unjust: it would be retrospective on the basis of actions by third parties. It would not reflect on the conduct or changed circumstances of the former spouse, who is the beneficiary of the earmarking order. It would be effected in circumstances that are not foreseen in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0665">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>357</span>
relevant legislation, especially the 1973 Act, which allows the courts to make changes in ancillary relief. It would be unfair to impose that situation on the former wife.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second alternative is that the pension could be split entirely at the expense of the person who earned it. The earmarking order might have been made for a substantial proportion of the pension. There may have been a 50 per cent. earmarking order. If the subsequent pension-splitting order is for another 50 per cent., we return to the position that I described previously, and which the Minister accepted was problematic. The efforts of the individual who may have spent a lifetime building up a pension with his employer's assistance would have come to virtually nothing. That would be most undesirable from the human point of view, as I argued previously, and from a social and economic point of view. It would reduce the incentive for people in such circumstances to buy pensions. Perhaps not many pension scheme members—the people who earned the pension—would reasonably feel aggrieved, but how would the employer feel? He may have made a great effort on behalf of a loyal employee, to whom no benefit would accrue. All—or the vast majority—of the pension's value would have been abstracted for the benefit of third parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those alternatives will face us if the amendment is rejected. I hope that the Committee will accept it and that we shall put in place the protections for which I argued previously. They relate to the value of people's pensions as in the case of the provision that would limit a pension-sharing order to once per pension, which we argued for previously. In addition, we would remove the anomaly in relation to existing earmarking orders. Although there have not been many, there are a number of them around. It is not entirely comparable to pension splitting. The result in terms of reducing the value of a member's pension may be comparable, but a retrospective problem is created by the fact that people had existing earmarking orders before the introduction of the Bill, whereas, by definition, there are no current pension-splitting orders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought that the Minister could be generous in regard to the amendment, if only because earmarking orders have been comparatively rarely used. If the amendment or something like it were accepted, he would not be driving a coach and horses through the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The evidence that earmarking orders have been comparatively rarely used appears on page 56 of the Select Committee report, where Mr. Pointer said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I, myself, have only hitherto been involved in one case in which earmarking has been argued."</p></blockquote>
It also appears on page 78, where Mr. Salter of the Solicitors' Family Law Society Association said, in regard to the number of earmarking orders that there had been:
	<span class='label label-info column'>358</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"I would not want to put a percentage on it. Whereas with earmarking we have seen hardly any orders at all go through, especially after contest hearings, this is going to be a much more important and much more widely used order."</p></blockquote>
Lord Justice Thorpe also made it clear, when we questioned him, that in his view earmarking orders were rare.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now that we can use this debate usefully, the Minister should help us to examine the role of earmarking orders in the past and why they have been so rarely used. While we are on this subject, perhaps he will also tell us something about attachment orders, which, again according to the evidence that we have, have been found to be—I am quoting from page xiv of the Select Committee report—"unworkable in practice".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure that many Committee members are familiar with earmarking orders, and it might be useful to hear from the Minister about them. Alternatively, Labour Members who have not yet taken part in our deliberations may want to give us the benefit of their knowledge. For instance, it would be nice to hear from the hon. Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale (Miss Smith), who has not uttered a word, or the hon. Member for City of Chester (Ms Russell), who has graced our proceedings, but we still wait to hear her dulcet tones. Perhaps she can explain to us the nature of earmarking orders. It would also be useful to hear from the hon. Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Mr. Shaw). He, too, has not found it necessary to utter a word during our proceedings. We are at least grateful to other hon. Members like the hon. Member for Gravesham, who has at least said something, and the hon. member for Colne Valley. She is an honourable exception, because she has shared her knowledge with us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon. Friend given any consideration to the difficult issue of what the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. What hon. Members say to their constituents is not within the terms of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, but earmarking orders are, Mr. Malins. I hope that the Minister will feel that in my short discourse on earmarking orders and the fact that they have been rarely used I have at least established that, where they have been used, there may have been a good reason for doing so. They may affect a considerable portion of the assets. For that reason alone, if an earmarking order has been made, pension sharing may not be appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I draw Opposition Members' attention to paragraph (7) on page 70, just over the page from the point at which their amendment would be inserted, as it does what the amendment seeks to do. Paragraph (7) ensures that
	<br><blockquote><p>"A pension sharing order… may not be made in relation to the rights of a person under a pension arrangement"</p></blockquote>
that is already subject to a pension earmarking order. That is what the Opposition propose, but it is already included in the Bill. The substantive difference between
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0666">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>359</span>
the paragraph in the Bill and the amendment is that the letter would also prohibit pension sharing even if the pension rights in question had previously been, but were no longer subject to, an earmarking order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for the proposal in the Bill is that if earmarked pension rights may be the subject of pension sharing, it could undermine the earmarking order. The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford rightly made that point, but that would not arise if the earmarking order had already ended. In those circumstances, there is no reason to restrict the availability of the pension-sharing option. Therefore, what is valuable in the amendment is already included in the Bill. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to hear that. I am happy to acknowledge that reading the Bill is not the easiest task that I have ever undertaken and it is clear that I did not bother to follow up the references in paragraph (7) to understand its significance. That is the consequence of not having armies of civil servants helping one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall tell the Minister why I did not investigate the meaning of that paragraph to see whether it gave the protection to pensions subject to an earmarking order that I thought was necessary. It was because it seemed inconceivable to me that the Government could propose such a cockeyed and contradictory Bill, which would provide protection against subsequent pension sharing for a pension subject to an earmarking order, but would not provide protection for a pension subject to an earlier pension-sharing order. That is extraordinary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems that, in paragraph (7), the Government have accepted for earmarking exactly the case for ensuring that there are not subsequent depredations of a pension that we were making for pension sharing. Indeed, the whole of the Minister's argument against accepting our earlier amendments—on the lines that they would introduce unequal rights between first and subsequent spouses—completely falls away. Perhaps those arguments were hypocritical or were not sincere in the first place, but it makes no sense to use them to resist our amendments to protect pensions against multiple splitting and then provide protection when the pension is split as the result of an earmarking order—the effect is exactly the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What all this means is that, if you are clever enough to persuade your first wife—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope you will convey my apologies to Mrs. Malins, if that remark was interpreted personally, which it was not intended to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It makes no sense to say that if one reaches an agreement with one's first wife on divorce, under which the value of one's pension is reduced through an earmarking order, then it is protected from any subsequent pension splitting, but if the initial arrangement is made on the basis of a pension-sharing order rather than an earmarking order—the economic
	<span class='label label-info column'>360</span>
effect of the two might be identical—then it is not protected from subsequent depredations and reductions. That makes no sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In light of the Government's assurances, I am delighted to withdraw the amendment, although logically the Minister should appeal to Committee members to go back to our previous discussion and accept our earlier amendments because they are consistent with his arguments for this provision. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>6.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 164, in page 70, leave out lines 49 and 50 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"affirmative resolution of both Houses of Parliament.".</p></blockquote>
We touched on this theme earlier. The amendment would ensure that the regulations in this part of the Bill are subject to affirmative resolution procedure. That is important because we are venturing into new territory. We identified a glaring inconsistency in the Government's approach to protecting pensions that are subject to an earmarking order and their decision not to protect pensions that are subsequently split. The Government are in considerable confusion, despite the fact that they have consulted—which was not the case with stakeholder pensions—and have had a long time to consider the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important for the House to use the affirmative resolution procedure to ensure that there is genuine parliamentary scrutiny of the regulations. It is also important that the legal profession and members of the Lord Chancellor's advisory group on ancillary relief have a chance to consider the Committee's arguments. I have no doubt that they will be as struck as I am by the inconsistencies in the Government's arguments. The Government have drafted the Bill and are threatening to use their Parliamentary majority to get it through. It will be possible to comment on this matter and to draft such regulations knowing that there will be further genuine parliamentary scrutiny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A distinction that is rapidly emerging between the Government and the Opposition is that the Government have forgotten about the existence of the affirmative resolution procedure. As far as I am aware, none of their Bills has made use of that procedure. No doubt someone could find an exception, because there must be one, but the Government's automatic, unthinking reaction is, "Good God! We have an enormous parliamentary majority. Why the hell do we want to bother with Parliament?" They use the standard statutory instrument procedure, which allows legislation to be passed before anyone realises its significance, and they pack Committees with people who are either docile or so bored that they say nothing—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>361</span>
resolutions may be drawn, at least subconsciously, from our experience in the Committee. It would be more subtle to leave my hon. Friends to draw their own conclusions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are arguing for more Parliamentary scrutiny and democracy from a Government who can put anything through the House, and I appeal to them to use the affirmative resolution procedure more frequently. Where is that more appropriate than in an area in which we are changing the law with the danger of tremendous human injustice from unnecessary legal costs and a burden on the reputation of our system of family law. The affirmative resolution procedure will ensure that the Government and the civil servants who advise them are particularly careful when drafting the regulations before submitting them to Parliament. That has not always been the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all those reasons, I hope that the amendment will be supported.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No one enjoys losing an election and I remember feeling stunned on the morning of 2 May 1997.

I felt secure about that because, during the halcyon days when I sat on the Government Benches, I listened to long speeches from Labour Ms—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] Does the Under-Secretary of State for Social Security want to intervene?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Hugh Bayley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I simply remarked—it is right that I should do so on my feet—that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary is very lucky. During the early part of his intervention, the hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The speeches of Labour Members when in oppposition, persuaded me that we were wrong and that there should have been more affirmative resolution procedure orders. The modern Conservative party is not ashamed to say sorry. Just today we have had clear evidence of the need for more affirmative resolution procedure orders. As my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford said, we are concerned about the arrangements for pension sharing. I fear the extreme situation in which lawyers pursue pension sharing arrangements like Buffalo Bill and Wild Bill Hickock trying to kill the last buffalo on the great American plains. They will use such cases like a milch cow to take money out of settlements. Obviously, we want the affirmative resolution procedure to apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>362</span>
Another example for demonstrating why we want the affirmative resolution procedure concerns subsequent splits. We have had advice from the Select Committee in its excellent report, in which it states at paragraph 62 on page xxiv:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We recommend that the monitoring of pension sharing arrangements should address any particular problems emerging from further marriages."</p></blockquote>
That clearly indicates the need for the affirmative resolution procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am not sure how that relates to the amendment, which is narrowly drawn. The hon. Gentleman should not divert from it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am shocked, Mr. Malins. I was giving the merest hint of the subjects that we need to discuss.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall make my third point quickly, because I do not want to return to our previous debate. We had an interesting discussion about the problems associated with earmarking. We need the affirmative resolution procedure in that context. As I understand it, earmarking only really relates to death-in-work benefits. I sat for countless hours listening to discussions about this matter. I believe that the hon. Member for Doncaster, North once made a speech on it. His arguments were very persuasive, although his speech was much longer and more verbose than mine will be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have always regarded myself first and foremost as a Member of the House of Commons, and it is important for hon. Members to scrutinise the actions of the Executive. I do not see myself as a placeman. These issues will affect our citizens' liberty and their financial affairs. The Government's proposals will interfere with people's pensions arrangements, which have been in place for several years—there are proposals to split them in certain ways. When the House of Commons examines such arrangements we should not rely on the negative resolution procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Select Committee on Procedure is considering the super-affirmative resolution procedure, which would enable us to amend regulations. The case for adopting that procedure, which could operate on a take-it-or-leave-it basis, is strong. My hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford, who is a keen-eyed individual in relation to Parliamentary procedure, might spot problems in the legislation, but with the present system there is not much that we can do to introduce amendments. The House should reassert itself and scrutinise such legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kali Mountford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making an interesting point.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady makes an interesting intervention. I welcome the suggestion with open arms. That is exactly how Standing Committees should consider legislation. Consideration of all major Bills should go in that direction. We are a small step from saying, "Actually, this is rather a good idea." Affirmative resolutions—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is interesting, but the hon. Gentleman is well away from the amendment under discussion. He must return to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another reason why affirmative resolutions must be the way to proceed in the future is that it would discourage the Government from bringing in too many regulations. They would have to ensure that any regulations were absolutely necessary. As my hon. Friend said, if the Minister and his officials knew that a regulation would almost certainly be taken on the Floor of the House or Upstairs in Committee, and would have to suffer the scrutiny of eagle-eyed Members like my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford, who goes through every line finely and ensures that it is grammatically correct and has the right effect, they would make sure that it was necessary. That is why we need more affirmative resolutions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to support my hon. Friends on the amendment. It is not the first time that my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar and I have put forward this argument, although not in the Committee. We are at one on the need for closer scrutiny of the Executive by Parliament. A vast amount of the Bill, which is crucial to the future of many people's lives, will be guided by regulations that will not be discussed in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not a lawyer, but, as I understand it, although there is a strong legal precedent for the courts to make up their own minds based on the arguments before them, they are guided by the debates in this place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kali Mountford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady agree with the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar that, although the Conservative party used affirmative orders more often when it was in government, the historic introduction of pre-legislative examination of Bills is a better way to proceed than the old-fashioned way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Hon. Members are allowing themselves to be tempted, unwisely, and the intervention was not strictly in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Please be assured, Mr. Malins, that I was not about to be tempted. The answer to the question is the same as the answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar. I would not wish to go down that route, as I know that you would call me to order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to go back to the point about the guidance that the courts will take from our discussions in Parliament. We hope that we can get a general steer from the Minister as to what will be in the regulations. As we have
	<span class='label label-info column'>364</span>
discovered, there is some confusion in the Government about what is and is not, what the effect is, how it ties in and whether the Family Law Act has been implemented. If we are confused and cannot see the regulations so that we can scrutinise them, comment on them or even vote on them, I should imagine that the courts will be equally confused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another matter that comes out strongly in the Select Committee's report is the need for lawyers and judges to be trained in this legislation. That also came out of the pre-legislative scrutiny, which I am sure the hon. Member for Colne Valley welcomes. How effectively will the courts be trained if there is no clear guidance from the House of Commons on how the regulations should be viewed and implemented? Even with a code of conduct, guidance or practice—which could be produced by the Lord Chancellor's Department, the Department of Social Security or whichever Department is responsible—the necessary guidance from the House of Commons will be lacking unless the affirmative resolution procedure is used. An increasing amount of legislation is subject to the negative resolution procedure—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is turning into a general debate about the affirmative resolution procedure, as the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I completely accept your guidance, Mr. Malins. Even on such a narrow point, my argument stands. Courts will need guidance, judges and lawyers will have to be trained and Parliament's thoughts will have to be interpreted. If we do not have the opportunity to debate the regulations, the courts will be confused, which will have a dramatic and costly effect on the people who apply to them because case law will have to be built up. I support my hon. Friend's amendment, as its purpose is to persuade the Government that this part of the Bill should be implemented by the affirmative resolution procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Malins, for bringing the discussion back to order. Anyone who heard the most recent series of speeches would be surprised to discover that the amendment relates to the stay period that will apply between the making of a pension-splitting order and its taking effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new rule-making power in new section 24F of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 will be used to establish the stay period, which will be the same length as the appeal period for each level of court. For example, if the High Court were to make the order, the stay period would be 35 days, which is the appeal period for that level of court. That is a sensible approach. This matter is not sensitive or controversial enough to merit the affirmative resolution procedure under any Government—whether the previous Government or this one. The rules will be subject to preliminary consultation to crystallise their content and public consultation once they have been drafted, and they will be laid as statutory instruments to be subject to the negative resolution procedure in the

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 76 in, page 70, line 50, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2C) No pension sharing order shall be made in favour of a person aged less than 40 years.".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>366</span>
Had amendment No. 162 been accepted, it might not have been necessary to move a number of the other amendments. Amendment No. 162 would have given a considerable degree of protection, in that it would have provided for pension-sharing orders to be used only in special circumstances, or when courts decided that justice could be achieved through no other means. Instead, we have tried to achieve at least some measure of protection against the utterly perverse, unjust effects of pension-sharing orders by devising a series of restrictions on their use that are much more specific than the generalised protection that amendment No. 162 would have provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment before us would provide one such restriction: no pension-sharing order could be made if the party whose pension were to be shared were less than 40 years old. It may be said that that is an arbitrary age and I regret that we are forced to fall back on the specific rather than the general. Such specific protections are protections in detail rather than in principle—it is the nature of specific protections that they tend to be arbitrary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If anyone should argue that we should set an age threshold of, say, 35 or 38, rather than 40, we shall be returning to Bernard Shaw and the actress, with which we became familiar during our discussions on stakeholder pensions. We should respond to that argument as we did before. Provided that the point of principle was agreed, we would be pragmatic and flexible about where the limits should be drawn and the degree to which the principle should be enshrined in law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is an important principle. Pension sharing, which can at any age have the perverse and unjust effects that I have referred to several times, is in most foreseeable circumstances likely to be less appropriate as a solution as the ages of the prospective parties to a pension share increase, for two principal reasons. One is that the value of a pension in the early years of work is small. The cash equivalent transfer value, as actuaries like to call it—it is a slightly different method of calculation from that used by accountants, who use present values—is inevitably pretty low for those in their 20s or even 30s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the costs of the transaction—I repeat this point, because I assure you that it is strictly relevant, Mr. Malins—are fixed costs. They are virtually the same irrespective of the value of the pension to be shared and the age of the parties. The costs are those that the pension managers, or trustees in the case of occupational pensions, incur and, under the terms of the Bill, can recover from the parties, according to a formula that we do not like—but we shall come to that later. They are the costs of the additional litigation and professional advice that may be required in the courts when the principles on which the pension share are to be based must be decided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. Gentleman is describing is slightly different from the amendment on the amendment paper. He said that it would stop pension sharing where the pension member was under 40. The amendment would stop pension sharing in favour of a person aged below 40. Under his amendment, the member of the pension scheme can be 50 or 60, but the person in whose
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0670">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>367</span>
favour the share is being made cannot be less than 40. The hon. Gentleman's account of what he intends is not consistent with what the amendment says.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am affraid that it was a slip of the tongue. I originally devised two amendments, one of which would have addressed the issue of the pension scheme member and the other the issue of the beneficiary of a pension split. The principles are similar in both cases. In both cases the costs are disproportionately high when the age of the partners is low. In absolute terms the costs are the same, but they will be disproportionately high when the value of the pension is low. Conversely the lower the age of the parties, the lower the value of the pension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second issue is one of natural justice. If someone is younger than 40 and has the disaster of a failed marriage, or any other failure in life, it is much easier to pick up the pieces and start again. It is much more plausible that someone in their 20s or 30s will be able to go back to work, build up a new pension, find a new partner and contract a new and, hopefully, successful marriage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While my hon. Friend is pursuing the thought of the young age group, is he aware of the evidence that, although participation in many pension schemes is compulsory, it is not until people reach the age of 40 that they begin to consider how best to provide—rather than mechanistically provide—for their retirement? After the age of 40, pension funds start to increase in value. Therefore, that age is a crucial psychological break, which reinforces the arguments for ensuring that pension splitting does not apply to people under the age of 40.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a helpful intervention. There are three reasons why, in the natural course of things, the value of a pension is lower, the younger the member of the pension scheme. The first reason is simply the time value of money. The second is that people tend to have progressive earnings. In other words, earnings tend to increase over time as do the value of contributions—either the employees' or employers'. The third is the fact, rightly mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham, that for psychological reasons retirement seems a long way off when one is 20 or 30, and so people do not set about providing for much of a pension at that age unless they are a member of an occupational scheme. Increasingly, high earners take advantage of the personal pension regime established by the previous Government and are making significant provision at an earlier age. Of course, it is desirable that they should do that if they can afford to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oaten</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, under the amendment, there would be no natural justice for a couple who married when they were 19 and then divorced when they were 39, because the wife in those circumstances would not benefit from the 20 years of pension that had accumulated?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already said that we are being forced to adopt amendments that provide a crude method of protecting individuals against the potentially unfair consequences of pension sharing because the ideal solution provided by amendment No. 162 was not
	<span class='label label-info column'>368</span>
accepted by the Committee. As I recall, the Liberal Democrats did not vote for that amendment either, so it is as much their fault as the Government's that the ideal solution was unavailable to us and we now have what I would describe, albeit prompted by the intervention of the hon. Member for Winchester, as the less desirable solution, which inevitably contains elements of arbitrariness and unfairness. Nevertheless, in the very undesirable position in which we reluctantly find ourselves, the Government having resisted our earlier amendments, we must at least try to improve the Bill so that on balance it is less pernicious than it would otherwise be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Rendel 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that, in practice, it is unlikely that amendment No. 162 would have covered a case such as the one described by my hon. Friend the Member for Winchester because it is likely that, in such a case, it would not have been possible to achieve a fair settlement without considering the pension?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Precisely. That is why I preferred amendment No. 162. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman has been paying attention—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] Well, no one can possibly accuse me of wasting the Committee's time if I repeat myself because, clearly, the hon. Gentleman did not grasp what I was saying earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am saying that amendment No. 162 would have been more just. Because amendment No. 76 is specific and targeted, it contains anomalies of its own. It follows that, under amendment No. 76, there will be cases in which justice will not be done, but we believe that in many more cases it will he done. We are forced back on that undesirable relative calculus by virtue of the fact that the Committee, including Liberal Democrat members, voted against amendment No. 162. The hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel) or, indeed, anyone else may be able to think of individual cases that would be better accommodated by amendment No. 162 than by amendment No. 76. I think that I made that point three times. Do I have to make it a fourth, fifth or sixth time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman certainly made the point three times. He asked whether he should make it a fourth, fifth or sixth time. I think that he knows my answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that if the answer is otiose, the question is also otiose. Hon. Members might even have understood my response—I live in hope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other aspect concerns the age of the beneficiary of the pension split rather than the provider of the pension credit. I explained that it is more plausible for someone to rebuild his or her life at an earlier age. An individual may hand over a large part of his or her pension—a substantial part of that person's assets—which enormously reduces his or her prospects in retirement. That is unfair if, a few months after the pension split, the former partner—the beneficiary of the split—gets a better paid job or marries someone who is wealthy. If the court were to consider that case with those circumstances, it would decide on all grounds of equity that no pension split should take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0671">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>369</span>
The present regime, which the Government seek to change and which has been in place for a long time, has two advantages. First, it provides for pension assets to be taken into account by the court when it decides on the general distribution of assets. Secondly, the court can earmark pension revenues for the benefit of a former spouse. That earmarking order is not irrevocable. It can be varied on application to the court in circumstances where justice requires it. That is the difference between the present regime and the regime that the Government want to introduce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must ask ourselves at each stage whether there is an enhancement or a loss of justice; whether there will be more fair or unfair decisions; whether there will be beneficial consequences for the lives of individuals; or whether we will create gratuitous, perverse incentives that will damage individuals and society. It is foolish of any legislature to encourage behaviour that is not in the interests of individuals or society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are forced to deal with the matter pragmatically. We would have preferred to deal with this as a matter of legal principle but, as amendment No. 162 was not accepted, we have to deal with it piecemeal. It is better to have these artificial, targeted amendments than to have no protections. As the anomaly will arise most frequently in the younger age group, the only way to provide protection is to devise an age cut-off. It is easy for Labour Members; they will not have to exceed their present levels of ingenuity to find cases in which my proposed cut-off will be inappropriate. But I repeat: the solution is to return to amendment No. 162. We would have much better law as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It could be argued that it would be unfair for a court to take account of issues such as the remarriage prospects of a divorcee. It is peculiar that section 25 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 requires the court to have regard—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Sitting suspended.</i></p>
	<p>8.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before dinner I was explaining that the amendment goes to the heart of one of the great quandaries in the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. It is about whether the remarriage prospects of a party to a divorce should be taken into account in a divorce settlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1973 Act is at least as often abused as it t is respected and that it is somewhat contradictory. Section 25(1)(c) of that Act enshrines the provision from the Matrimonial Causes Act 1965, which stated that the standard of living that is enjoyed by a family before a marriage breakdown should be taken into account by a court. Section 25(1)(a) of the 1973 Act states that the court—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] This is germane to our debate,
	<span class='label label-info column'>370</span>
Mr. Malins. If Labour Members do not listen to my argument, they will ask questions that have already been answered, as they did previously. To save the Committee's time, I suggest that they listen carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 25(1)(a) of the 1973 Act states that the court shall take into account
	<br><blockquote><p>"the income, earning capacity, property and other financial resources which each of the parties to the marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future".</p></blockquote>
It is obvious that, in practice, the likelihood of one of the parties contracting another marriage, which might be financially advantageous, may be the most significant factor in terms of that person's future financial prospects. Is the court supposed to take that into account? That matter has never been satisfactorily resolved. The idea that judges—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That matter is separate from the amendment, as the hon. Gentleman well knows.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point of the amendment is to distinguish between parties who are less than 40 years old and those who are more than 40 years old at the time of divorce. My contention, which the Government have not so far contradicted, is that one distinction between those two age groups is a person's prospects of remarriage, which correlate negatively with age. That is an established sociological fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment goes some way towards resolving what is an unresolved quandary in the 1973 Act, which is a key part of our divorce legislation. The courts are enjoined to have regard to the financial resources that each of the parties to a marriage has or is likely to have in the foreseeable future, but in practice they ignore that requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have acknowledged that many of the amendments that I have moved attempt to retrieve by the back door one or two provisions from the wreck. When the Committee decided to reject amendment No. 162, we lost an opportunity to change the principles of this part of the Bill. I am sure that Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrat Members will have cause to regret that unfortunate decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter is not resolved in jurisprudence and it is not resolved—or clearly resolvable—by the courts. Hence the importance of the amendment. The quandary is not resolvable by the courts because it is manifestly absurd, risible and unfortunate for judges to have to make their own assessment of the prospects of remarriage of the parties who appear before them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not understand how the prospects of remarriage are relevant to the narrow amendment that is before us. We are not having a Second Reading debate on matrimonial finances in general. The hon. Gentleman must stick to the amendment. If he does not, I may have to ask him to resume his seat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the absence of a fundamental revision of the law, which our deliberations this evening do not seem to be achieving, an anomaly exists in this context. It would be resolved to a considerable extent in practice if we adopted my albeit slightly crude age-based amendment.
