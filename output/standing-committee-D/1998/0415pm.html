	<div class='title'>INCAPACITY FOR WORK: PERSONAL CAPABILITY ASSESSMENTS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed [this day]:</i> No. 85, in page 49, line 9, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"provided that in making the assessment under (a) and (b) above, account shall be taken of the types of jobs available in the locality considered.".—[	<i>Mr. Quentin Davies.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>2.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I invite the hon. Gentleman to resume speaking, I point out that we have taken an hour and a half to discuss an extremely narrow amendment, with which we are not yet finished. The Committee has had a tendency to roam wide and if it continues to do so I shall have to rethink the plea from the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies) to allow a clause stand part debate. However, it is entirely up to the Committee members to decide what they want to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Grantham and Stamford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear what you say, Mr. McWilliam. I trust that nothing that I say during the rest of the debate on the amendment, or on any other amendments, will move you further in the direction of siding against a clause stand part debate. I know that you are a very experienced Chairman, Mr. McWilliam, and that you will be impervious to any attempts by Ministers to avoid a debate an the clause. There are many reasons why the Government may wish to avoid such a general debate, but I am sure that you will insist that Parliament's rights are upheld.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. My only concern was that hon. Members did not assist them to avoid debate on the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely take that point, Mr. McWilliam.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has been an interesting debate, which has achieved a purpose that I did not anticipate—it has elucidated a general principle which is central to the clause. We must be pleased that that elucidation has taken place. However, it has taken place in spite of, rather than because of, the efforts of the Under-Secretary. To be kind to the hon. Gentleman, he may be as much the victim of confusion as an agent in generating it. The new Labour Government, when they play on the virus of confusion, sometimes find that they have infected themselves with it, and that may be so in this case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary questioned at some length why we did not come up with a definition of "work" when the all-work test was passing through the House of Commons and why we did not make these points to
	<span class='label label-info column'>768</span>
Alistair Burt when he occupied the position of responsibility that the hon. Gentleman now occupies. The answer is, of course, that the all-work test made such a definition unnecessary because it was an absolute, all or nothing test. It was, to use the modern jargon, a binary test—yes or no, pass or fail. Pass or fail are difficult words to use in this context and it may be unfair to do so. If you were judged to be capable of work, you did not pass it; if you were judged to be incapable of all work, you were accepted as being entitled to benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that no one is judging me to be incapable of work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly not, Mr. McWilliam.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have announced, with all the usual panoply of PR that accompanies their announcements, that they are abolishing the all-work test and establishing its replacement, the personal capability assessment, in the clause. They claim that there is a difference between the new personal capability assessment and the all-work test that is not merely a difference in name—that it will look positively at activities that the disabled might do which were not taken into account, or identified, by the all-work test. If that were to be the case, the amendment would certainly be necessary. A clear definition of work would be required, which would—as the hon. Member for Bristol, North-West (Dr. Naysmith) pointed out before the Committee adjourned—need to be a definition that made sense in terms of local conditions. Nothing could be more cynical or cruel than denying someone benefit on the grounds that they are capable of an activity for which the scope does not exist. That is why the amendment would have been necessary. The Government could have said that they were making a genuine change, and that they were rejecting and discarding the all-work test. They could have said that they were replacing it with a much more nuanced system that would assess capabilities in much greater depth, draw different conclusions for different people and consider a whole new range of activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would have accepted such an approach, for which there is something to be said. I shall not state the case for it any further, but I was willing to be open minded. Under the pressure of the amendment, and because of the inexorable logic that such a change would require a new definition of "work" that made sense in terms of local work opportunities, the Government have decided not to adopt a new approach. If I understood the remarks made by the Under-Secretary just before the sitting was suspended for lunch, the Government have now come round to saying clearly that they are not taking that route, and that the change is merely semantic. In their view, we have been told, the all-work test remains the all-work test in all but name. They have argued that there is no difference in the way in which people's eligibility or otherwise for incapacity benefit will be judged. Everybody who passes the all-work test will, with the same medical condition, pass the personal capability assessment, and vice versa.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be delighted to give way to the Under-Secretary if I have misunderstood his second rather clearer declaration on the subject. If I am correct, my amendment is not necessary because we are back to the all-work test in everything but name, and the name is all
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0893">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>769</span>
that has changed. We are back to my old friend, Mr. Alastair Campbell. It does not matter about the substance—the Government are concerned only with the image, the rhetoric and the name. We are back to good old new Labour, which we have grown during the past two years perhaps not to love but at least to get used to. I am not sure whether the British public are developing much respect for the Labour party's approach to modern politics, but we at least know how the machine functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment was designed to alleviate the effects of what would have been a source of enormous injustice, had the Government followed the alternative route of the individualised personal capability assessment, and had the legislation put into practice what the Government's rhetoric anticipated. Now, hon. Members have heard that the Government are not going to do that at all, that the reality has not changed and that we are back to the old all-work test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make it clear that a particular assurance is on the record. I repeat that the way in which an individual's eligibility for incapacity benefit will be assessed will not change at all, and that people who would previously have qualified for incapacity benefit run no danger of being told that they no longer qualify because a personal capability assessment has identified factors or considerations that would not have emerged from the previous all-work test. The Committee has heard that assurance. I have said twice—with your indulgence and patience, Mr. McWilliam, which I greatly appreciate—that it enables the Committee to be clear that the Under-Secretary has no intention of correcting me because there is nothing to correct my exegesis of his declaration. That being the case, the amendment is not required—a circumstance that is even more favourable to the Opposition than its acceptance—because it means that the previous Conservative regime of the all-work test, which has some problems, but with which we are at least familiar, will carry on. As the Under-Secretary reminded us, some of us voted for it, so we have some hesitation in throwing it over—not, at least, without more detailed and careful consideration of its weaknesses, something which the Government have in practice undertaken. In those circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 86, in page 49, line 28, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(4A) Before any regulations under this section are submitted to parliament the Secretary of State shall have consulted with organisations representing disabled people and shall have taken reasonable account of their submissions and concerns."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 186, in clause 68, page 60, line 47, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"() Before exercising any power to make regulations under sections 47 to 56, the Secretary of State shall consult groups representing disabled people and other such persons as he considers appropriate.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment mentions the terrible word "consult". It would place an obligation on the Government to consult the representatives of
	<span class='label label-info column'>770</span>
organisations for disabled people. One might think that a good Government would want nothing less than to consult. I framed the amendment bearing in mind what happened in the first part of the Bill, which dealt with stakeholder pensions. A Green Paper was published, giving all sorts of virtuous undertakings about the extent to which the Government were committed to consultation. It extended an invitation to the general public, and anyone else who was interested, to let the Government have their views on the Green Paper by 31 March, with the clear implication that that could affect potential legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government then kicked in the face everyone who had been tempted to take that invitation remotely seriously by producing a Bill in February and considering it in Committee some months before the consultation period had expired. We saw very graphically in relation to stakeholder pensions the extremely unfortunate habit of mind that the Government have got into as a result of their large majority and their media management machine, which they are so proud of and which they hide behind. They believe that they can treat the public with contempt in that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I can see nothing here that says that the Government ought to consult with their media machine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, Mr. McWilliam, but I hope that you can follow the logic that a Government who have treated not merely Parliament but the public with such levity regarding consultation in the very recent past, on a matter which arises in the first third of this Bill, must be treated with scepticism when it comes to the necessary element of consultation in framing the regulations that are provided for in clause 50 on the important matter of what happens to disabled people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several important aspects of the amendment need to be emphasised. The first is contained in the phrase:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Before any regulations under this section are submitted to parliament".</p></blockquote>
I give the Under-Secretary notice now that when he produces regulations under this provision—this will also apply to other important provisions—we will ask him what consultations have taken place, who was consulted and what the responses were so that we can understand the background against which those regulations have been drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to be absolutely clear about this. As I was saying earlier, it is only fair to disabled people to state in advance what the rules of the game are when they go for assessment. It is also only fair to state to the Government what the rules of the game are if regulations are drawn up for Parliament to consider through the negative or affirmative resolution procedure. We hope that it will be affirmative as you know, Mr. McWilliam.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We emphasise the importance of Parliament being told about consultation, so that it can take an intelligent view of the proposed regulation. It should not merely be based on its instinctive reaction to the proposals put before it, or on whatever research individual Members of Parliament can do. Parliament should take into account
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0894">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>771</span>
the responses of organisations that should have been consulted and the fact that no one has been consulted, if that appears to be the case. So we are putting the Government on notice that we expect high standards of consultation—higher than those adopted for stakeholder pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second aspect of the amendment to be emphasised is the phrase:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and shall have taken reasonable account of their submissions and concerns."</p></blockquote>
The Government are intoxicated with the idea of manipulating the image, believing that that is a way of evading substantive responsibilities to deliver. It is especially important that we emphasise that such consultation is intended to be a real exercise. It should not be a perfunctory pantomime in which a civil servant is told, "Oh well, to fulfil the condition that Parliament has imposed, you should send out a letter to any 25 organisations and then forget about it." That would not be good enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
2.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to ensure that there is a genuine dialogue between the Government and the organisations that have considerable experience in that area of disability. There ought to be genuine checks and balances, not an over-weaning and over-mighty bureaucracy backed up by a Government with a vast, silent and often, so far as one can make out, docile, majority. That is not a good formula for a Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to impose such a provision by inserting into the Bill the requirement on the Government to "have taken reasonable account" of the submissions and concerns expressed by the organisations consulted. If the Government were genuine about the consultation exercise, they would I hope have accepted our suggestion with alacrity. They should recognise the amendment's purport and significance, which is that it places the onus on the Government to tell Parliament why they have not accepted the views, concerns, or submissions of disability organisations. There might be good reasons for not accepting such submissions. The first part of the amendment makes it clear that Parliament wants to know about the submissions, the second that Parliament wants to know why submissions have not been accepted or applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would set a higher hurdle to produce higher standards of consultation than we have often had from Governments, certainly vastly higher than those of the Government recently. Despite the political rhetoric, there is a general consensus that it is important for Parliament to be seen to do its job effectively and more effectively than it has done. Government should be more open than it has been. Consultation ought to he a central part of legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember the new Labour rhetoric of the previous Parliament—they always agreed with such suggestions. I said the same several times, and my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) will bear me out. I proposed during the previous Parliament that we should automatically have Special Standing Committees before Bills are considered. I have a
	<span class='label label-info column'>772</span>
reasonable record on the subject, as do many new Labour Members. Now, they have the opportunity to deliver on their rhetoric, specifically that on consultation, from the priveledged position of being in Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question is whether consultation will be a genuinely meaningful process and a discipline on legislation, or a charade and a game—an image-projecting and spinning exercise at which they are so adept. That is the purpose of the amendment. Even at such a relatively late stage of the proceedings, I continue to hope for a favourable response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mark Oaten 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Winchester)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to hold up the Committee. There is agreement between the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives on the amendment. I am comfortable with the amendment of the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford. We have tabled amendment No. 186, which relates to a different clause but is concerned with the same principle of consultation as the hon. Gentleman's amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The briefings that hon. Members have received during the Committee stage of the Bill from the disability lobby have been superb. Whether or not we agree with their stance, no hon. Member can fail to appreciate the length to which such organisations have gone to ensure that we are all aware of the issues involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My experience as disability spokesman for the Liberal Democrat party for the past two years has been that work of the highest quality comes from organisations such as the Royal National Institute for the Blind, the Royal National Institute for Deaf People, Scope and Mencap—you could list all the others in the consortium. It is essential that the Government are involved in a dialogue with those groups, not only because of the highly professional material that they produce, but because they are in direct contact with the folk who will be affected by these measures. While we all see individuals in our surgeries who will be directly affected by the Bill, those specialist groups know first hand what is happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A mechanism requiring Ministers to consult is essential; the decision on whether or not to consult cannot be left to their good will. At the beginning of this Parliament, I thought that the way in which the Government consulted with disability groups was particularly poor. There was the fiasco of the benefit integrity project and the appalling scenes when disabled groups felt that they had to chain themselves to the rails of No. 10 Downing street. They did not get it right at that early stage. That said, however, I believe that the current Ministers have engaged in a dialogue. The problem is that those Ministers are of such high quality that they will surely be advancing to greater things; we cannot rely on the same good will, quality and eagerness to engage in debate in those who may replace them. If I have not flattered them sufficiently to accept the amendment, I do not know what more I can do. Such consultation is essential to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, consultation should take place at the earliest possible opportunity, not when the Government's mind is closed. As the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford said, they must genuinely engage in that debate, but I disagree with the hon.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0895">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>773</span>
Gentleman in that I do not think that we can legislate to say that if you listen, you must take on board what you are told. On the other hand, you can certainly legislate—as our amendment would—for a formal, open and clearly understood process so that you engage in a sensible dialogue with a group of highly informed individuals who could make such legislation better if they were listened to more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before I call the hon. Member for Beaconsfield—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I apologise—the hon. Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait). I note that the hon. Member for Winchester included an awful lot of "yous" in his speech. I do not know why, but everyone has got a bit slack this afternoon and I am being accused of all sorts of things.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Jacqui Lait 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beckenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. McWilliam. I am looking forward to the day when my majority in Beckenham increases to equal the majority of my colleague in Beaconsfield—which it will do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the amendment. In doing so, I draw on my experience as a Parliamentary private Secretary in the Department of Social Security—to which I owned up this morning—when the Bill containing the all-work test was being debated. The consultation that my Government went through to draw up the all-work test was extensive and effective. In fact, in the long run it it produced a much better test than had originally been drafted. We benefited enormously from the advice of various lobbying organisations. They were helpful in clarifying details and pointing out some of the difficulties with proposals that supposed experts in the area had come up with. On the basis of that experience, I support the amendment and hope that the Government will assure us that they will be going through as rigorous and as effective a consultation process—if not more so—as the previous Government did in designing the all-work test.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill contains clear examples of how things work when consultation takes place and when it does not. My hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford made some telling points about stakeholder pensions. We could compare and contrast those with pension
	<span class='label label-info column'>774</span>
splitting, on which there was the opportunity of pre-legislative scrutiny. I have been in the House since 1992 and as each year passes I become more convinced that pre-legislative scrutiny is important. An important part of that process is discovering what experts in the field have to say. What the hon. Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten) said about the quality of the briefing that we have received is absolutely right. I have been especially grateful for a briefing from the RNIB on incapacity benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall briefly cite some of the matters on which we should consult experts before these excellent Ministers make up their minds. The RNIB is concerned about the proposal to introduce means-testing and the weakening of the contributory principle and makes some good points about complexity, to which we shall probably return when we debate the next group of amendments. No system is improved by making it more complex. We have received some excellent books from the Child Poverty Action Group—three volumes, two of which I have here. People should not need to consult such excellent but weighty tomes to discover whether they are entitled to benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The RNIB also points out that people will be penalised if they become disabled at the wrong time, which is a big problem. I do not for a moment think that the Government intended to do that, but that will certainly be one unintended consequence of rushing the Bill through in an attempt to reduce the number of people claiming incapacity benefit. The Under-Secretary was straightforward about that attempt. He talked about how the number of such people had grown under the Conservative Administration during a period of unemployment. I think that he was trying to suggest that some people were on incapacity benefit who should not be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not be rushing the Bill through just for the Government to get people off incapacity benefit to reduce the social security budget. We must shed light on what the Secretary of State said at the Social Security Question Time before last about people claiming incapacity benefit for "dubious medical reasons". During the consultation process we would be able to pursue exactly what the Secretary of State meant by that. The Under-Secretary told us that the Government do not intend to change the medical qualifications in any way from those of the all-work test. Does that mean that the Secretary of State will second-guess those unchanged medical opinions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Levitt 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(High Peak)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help the hon. Gentleman my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State's remark was perhaps inspired by the fact that current incapacity benefit take-up figures suggest that a quarter of all males aged 60 are capable of no work at all. I do not think that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State believes that figure, and I certainly do not. Therefore, the incapacity benefit figures cannot accurately reflect the true state of affairs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be Parliamentary, but it is not very nice, as my mother would say. I am, however, keen that we should have a clause stand part debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also keen to say that consultation will make for better legislation. Last night, we saw clauses being hurried through the House because the level of consultation was not right and things had not been thought through. That is not in our interests; it is certainly not in the interests of the House, the Committee and the good running of our proceedings for things not to be properly thought out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everyone thinks that he or she has a monopoly on truth, but the hard fact in politics is that there is another point of view, which needs to be heard. My hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford made it clear that we do not expect slavishly to follow consultation just because it is there. I think that the hon. Member for Winchester misunderstood that. We do, however, need to take it into consideration. We need to say, "You are wrong because of this." There has been an increasing tendency, particularly over the past two years, to say, "You are wrong; we have a majority." There is a need for dialogue between groups with expertise in this matter, the Government and Opposition parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is most reasonable. It would be to the benefit of the Government, the Bill, and, more importantly, people who claim incapacity benefit if we accepted the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I begin by thanking the hon. Members for Winchester and for Brentwood and Ongar for their kind remarks? We will continue to do the best that we can from the Front Bench. May I reciprocate by saying that all Opposition Members have made an extremely good job of their task? Long may they be in a position to continue to provide such effective Opposition to the Government's policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Winchester raised an important point. The quality of the work that disability organisations do is extremely high. They work closely with the disability benefits system, and some of those involved are directly affected by it. It behoves hon. Members on both sides of the Committee to listen carefully to what they say, to weigh their arguments, and to think about how they should inform our actions. The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar is right: nobody expects the Government slavishly to follow everything that is put to them just because there is consultation. Indeed, there would be no purpose in having a Parliament or a Government if one could simply rely on pressure groups always to get the issue right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Under-Secretary is not inadvertently misunderstanding anything that I said. I made it absolutely clear that the Government and Parliament may have good reason not to accept
	<span class='label label-info column'>776</span>
representations by outside organisations, however specialist and excellent they may be. The purpose of the amendment is, however, to place the onus on the Government to explain why they do not accept such suggestions and representations. I hope that the Under-Secretary realises that that is a very different concept and that he can accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with the amendment after I have addressed some of the arguments advanced in the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar referred to the welfare benefits advice published by the Child Poverty Action Group. It is good advice. Other voluntary bodies are analysing Government policy and providing independent advice—the Disability Alliance, for example, is providing advice manuals for welfare rights advisers—and it is important, in a democracy, that the public has access to such advice, although it does not remove the obligation on the Government to publish their own explanatory material.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Beckenham emphasised that the previous Government carried out full consultation on the all—work test at the time of its introduction. There was no statutory requirement to do so—that consultation occurred because it was good practice. This Government also believe that it is good practice. The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford put me on notice that when regulations are brought before the House—I am sure that they will be debated, whether they are subject to the negative or affirmative resolution procedure—he will ask the Government what consultation has taken place. I shall be pleased to respond to the hon. Gentleman's question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have a good record of consulting with organisations that represent disabled people, in a number of different contexts, across our whole agenda. We rely on those organisations to challenge and develop our thinking and we value immensely their contribution to the policy debate. Even though those organisations are not always in agreement with the Government, their advice is always helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department is already subject to a statutory requirement to submit most draft social security regulations to the Social Security Advisory Committee for scrutiny. Those regulations are put out for public consultation when the committee considers it appropriate. A wide range of disability organisations are invited to consider draft regulations and to submit their comments to the committee. That has been the procedure for some time; it is the appropriate procedure, and the Government intend to continue it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To clarify the situation, and to avoid the accusation of misleading the Committee, given that the Government intend to do what has always been done in the past—we will follow the normal practice whereby the Social Security Advisory Committee does not scrutinise regulations made within six months of passing the relevant primary legislation. That is because extensive consultation will have taken place during the preparation and passage of a Bill. There is no point in wasting time and energy by immediately having the same debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0897">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>777</span>
The Government make every effort to ensure that disability organisations are aware of new Government proposals, and we listen to their concerns. Last summer, the Department set up the Disability Benefits Forum to seek those organisations' views on the proposals relating to incapacity and disability benefits in the welfare reform Green Paper. We have consulted widely on all the measures in the Bill that relate to benefits for disabled people, and we have given careful consideration to the responses. We responded to many of the views expressed when we published the disability Green Paper. Most notably, we responded to the concern that the age 20 cut—off for passported incapacity benefit would disadvantage young disabled people who go into higher education or training. That is why we introduced an amendment to extend the age cut-off to 25 in prescribed circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government already have frequent and wide—ranging contacts with organisations that represent disabled people, on formal and informal bases. We discuss, for example, the development of the periodic review procedure, which will replace the benefits integrity project, and the arrangements for replacing the allwork test with the personal capability assessment. The arrangements are flexible. We are continually developing and changing the arrangements, in consultation with the relevant organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope that disability organisations will continue to give us the benefit of their advice and expertise while we develop the operational detail of the Bill's proposals. We already have a statutory obligation to consult the Social Security Advisory Committee and we believe that a change in the statutory consultation arrangements is unnecessary. Therefore, I urge the Committee to reject the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's response was reasonably conciliatory, but he has not told us anything that we did not already know. I always try to give him credit where it is due and I am glad that the Government relented and agreed to extend access to the new non—contributory incapacity benefit, which will replace the severe disablement allowance, to those who are under the age of 25 rather than of 20. I accept that that is a small concession, although I hope that the clause will not be enacted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note with pleasure and a sense of justification that effective consultation was the reason for making that concession. That shows the way in which the consultation process can from time to time help to improve the quality of legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand why it was tempting for the Under-Secretary to use such phrases as, "as has always happened" and "as has always been done". He might say, "The suggestion was made by a Conservative Member. What we are doing is no worse than what any previous Conservative Administration have done, so we have solved the problem. "However, he has not solved it and that is not how he should go about his job. He should be more proud of his responsibilities, his party and his electoral victory. He should try to improve the situation and not use the alibi that nothing needs to be done
	<span class='label label-info column'>778</span>
because Conservative Administrations had a similar view. That is a hopeless argument and that aspect of his speech did not impress me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would raise the game a little by ensuring that the standards of consultation were improved. Sixty or 70 years ago there was practically no consultation, although at that date there was much less legislation as well. Consultation has improved in the past few decades, regardless of which party was in power, but it could become a more institutionalised aspect of the legislative process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would not alter the fact that ultimately it is Parliament's responsibility to decide on the content of the regulations and that it is the Government's responsibility to think carefully before bringing proposals before Parliament. It goes without saying that Parliament and the Executive branch may have good reasons for rejecting consultees' proposals and I accept that that may happen more than I anticipate. I agree with Labour and Conservative Members' comments about the quality of the briefings that we have received from the Disability Benefits Consortium and from other groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although it is clear where ultimate responsibility rests, establishing that formal account must be taken account of consultation would be a step forward in the legislative process. If the amendment is rejected, clear, reasoned argument should be given for doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends and I intend to press the amendment to a vote and I am encouraged by the comments of the hon. Member for Winchester to believe that we shall not be alone in supporting it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, amendment No. 84, in page 49, leave out lines 29 to 35.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that on the previous amendment I passed your personal capability assessment, Mr. McWilliam, which is the clause stand part debate availability assessment. I tried hard to meet your rigorous test and I shall try to do so again now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0898">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>779</span>
The amendments are inextricably linked. We want to remove subsection (5) and replace it with the words in amendment No. 196 in the interests of natural justice. The Opposition are playing the major role in the Committee, but there is no reason why the same concern should not be shared by Labour Back Benchers—they never voice their concern in this Committee—because we should all keep natural justice in mind when considering legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The personal capability assessment has momentous consequences for those who undergo the test because it will decide whether they have access to incapacity benefit. I must emphasise a point that the Government too easily forget: people pay for benefit through national insurance contributions in the same way that other insurance benefits are paid for through annual premiums. Whether someone who becomes disabled can receive incapacity benefit will depend on whether the assessment is passed, and that will be a momentous event. Disabled people often have an unpleasant psychological shock and a hideous experience at the beginning of their disability. I am amazed at the calm and courage with which so many people face up to their new situation, and they should not have to go through a stressful and worrying test on top of that. I do not pretend that there is an alternative to some form of medical test, but we want it to be as effective as possibler. We shall come to that issue on clause stand part. We should ensure that once people have passed the test and been given access to incapacity benefit, they will not be summoned back the following week because the Benefits Agency, which is under pressure from the Department of Social Security, which in turn is under pressure from the Treasury, has decided that if they have another test they might fail it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That could be the effect of subsection (5), which we are trying to remove. I shall read it out to the Committee, as I can see that some Labour Members are not paying attention to the debate and have almost certainly not bothered to read the Bill. We shall soon debate clauses which are more likely to be passed if Labour Committee members make a point of not reading the text, and do not know what they are voting for. However, I shall read out the subsection that I am trying to have removed, so that they do not have that excuse on this occasion.
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may, in the case of a person who for any purpose of this Act has been determined to be incapable of work in accordance with a personal capability assessment (including one carried out by virtue of this subsection), require the question whether the person is capable or incapable of work to be determined afresh in accordance with a further personal capability assessment."</p></blockquote>
That is couched in cumbersome, bureaucratic prose, but what it means is that there will be no protection for someone who has been through and passed a personal capability assessment one day, against being called back the following day, or week or month, for another one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not good enough. The principles of natural justice should apply where any system of qualification in life is established by the state. There should be clear rules on how the tests are to be conducted—we have already discussed that, and we may touch on it again. There should be fairness between individuals, professionalism on the part of those doing the testing and proper systems of appeal. Those are essential principles. Once a person
	<span class='label label-info column'>780</span>
has passed the test, he or she should feel secure in the knowledge that he or she has overcome that hurdle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the issue that we discussed in our deliberations on amendment No. 78. That is, the relationship between the personal capability assessment and the work-focused interview. We do not want people to go to the work-focused interview either obsessed by the fear that they might lose benefit, or feeling that if they let slip something—or if something is extracted from them—in an incautious moment, they will be summoned back to another personal capability assessment the following week, because they have said something that could lead to their benefit being taken away. Claimants would not have a proper work-focused interview in those circumstances. They will have a proper work-focused interview only if their eligibility for benefit on medical grounds has already been established—not permanently, but for a defined period. That would be a definitive assessment, valid for a specific amount of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 196 would replace subsection (5) with the provision that personal capability assessments could be carried out only once every five years. Whenever I put a precise figure into an amendment of this kind, I always explain to the Committee why I have done so. I necessarily have to make an arbitrary decision regarding the amount of money, the number of years, or whatever the context demands. Like any arbitrary figure, the figure of five years is open to dispute and to being shifted slightly in one direction or another, without substantive alteration to the principles that I wish to enshrine in the Bill. If someone thinks that four years or seven years might be more appropriate, I should be open to that. It is once again a case of Bernard Shaw and the actress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister might respond to my proposal by saying that in certain circumstances it might be necessary to have an emergency personal capability assessment, or a more rapid one, or perhaps to have one at the behest of the claimant. There could be circumstances in which a change in the claimant's condition, known to the Benefits Agency, would make it reasonable to have another personal capability assessment. I would not resist a modification to my amendment that would provide, in exceptional circumstances, for a personal capability assessment to be carried out at any time. However, the onus would be on the Benefits Agency to explain why the circumstances were exceptional. In all other circumstances, everyone would understand in advance the framework in which they were operating and would know that they had security of tenure for a defined period in respect of incapacity benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seemed to me that a period of five years struck a reasonable trade-off between granting benefit for life—a problem that already exists in the system, and with which we shall deal—and granting benefit for too short a period, which would place people under too much stress and undermine the basis for effective and fruitful work-orientated interviews.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a period of time would also strike the right trade-off between enabling reasonable monitoring and control of the system by the Benefits Agency—which could then be confident, in a broad-brushed way, of matching receipt of incapacity benefit with genuine
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0899">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>781</span>
eligibility—with the avoidance of incurring excessive costs through the multiplication of assessments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During consideration of the previous amendment, we discovered that, in the case of the all-work test, assessments will be carried out by doctors, and that nothing will change except the wording. If all such assessments are to be carried out professionally, the provision will prove expensive. Professional medical time does not come cheap, nor should it. Such people are trained to relieve suffering and save lives. The prime objective of their training is not their retention by the Benefits Agency to assess eligibility for incapacity benefit; nor is it their retention by the insurance industry to assess eligibility for private insurance. Both are respectable and necessary uses of professional medical resources, but we must recognise that such resources are scarce and expensive. We must not squander money through an unnecessarily high number of assessments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figure of five years is intended to be a reasonable compromise, but if any Committee member wants to persuade me that that figure is wrong, I should be delighted to listen to alternative suggestions in an attentive and conciliatory fashion. However, we should not allow the clause to proceed with no limitation and the nasty smell of arbitrary government. As it stands, the Secretary of State will be empowered to summon for a personal capability assessment people who have been assessed as recently as last week. Such incidents might easily happen, either through human error or because an official wants to get at a particular individual. No doubt they are pretty rare occurrences in the Benefits Agency, but we must legislate on the basis that we recognise original sin. No organisation is perfect. In my experience, errors of negligence are frequent in any human enterprise, and the deliberate actions of individuals give rise to unpleasantness. One must keep such problems to the minimum through the use of proper checks and balances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am saying en clair that we must provide against the persecution of individuals by the Benefits Agency. Under the clause, any official acting in the name of the Secretary of State could easily do that. I am certain that the Secretary of State, the Minister of State and the Under-Secretary would be the last people to persecute anyone. However, they would not know of such an occurrence. They would simply have pushed through with their vast majority a clause that provides arbitrary power for officials across the length and breadth of the country, which might be abused one time out of 10,000. In my submission, that would be one time too many.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the basis of the two amendments. I am grateful to you, Mr. McWilliam, for allowing them to be taken together, as they must be considered as an inter-related whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oaten</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I am sympathetic to the thrust of the Conservative amendments. A system in which people are regularly dragged back for interviews is undesirable. Despite the assurances from Ministers that the interviews and assessments will be a positive experience, an element of fear and concern will exist no matter how professional and positive the process. A limit therefore needs to be set.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>782</span>
3.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned about the lack of flexibility in the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford. The introduction of a five-year fixed period is the wrong way to tackle the problem. Surely it would be better if, at the time of the assessment, a member of the medical profession—or other professional involved in the process—judged when it would be most suitable to carry out a future assessment. That would allow professional judgment as to when the next assessment should occur to take precedence over a political judgment on the matter. That would be the best way to ensure that an appropriate form of assessment takes place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The critical factor would be making the judgment clear to the person attending the appointment. All hon. Members would agree that it is not acceptable for individuals not to know where they stand or what will happen next. The attraction of the amendment of the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford is that people would know exactly what would happen next. A professional medical assessment, which would determine when the individuals concerned should return for a further assessment—whether in two, three, four or five years—would provide clarity and certainty. The hon. Gentleman asked for a better suggestion, and that would be a better way forward, although Liberal Democrat Members are sympathetic to the thrust of his argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Julian Brazier 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Canterbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak about amendment No. 196. I was relieved to hear my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford say that amendment No. 84 was a probing amendment. I become nervous when probing amendments relate to medical matters, as I remember the hon. Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone) getting into difficulty over an intricate matter relating to the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A difficult balance has to be struck between what is fair to the taxpayer and what is fair to those who may or may not be incapable of work because of disability. All hon. Members have constituents who are disabled and who visit us at our surgeries. A number of disabled constituents visited me to express their concerns about the benefit integrity project, which I supported. One of those constituents had been hard done by, but I am convinced that another, whose next-door neighbour I knew extremely well, had not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue raised by amendment No. 196 is whether the five years—or a particular period—is the best way to provide a degree of protection. I have three friends who are severely disabled—they are all in wheelchairs—and they all have busy full-time jobs. However, many members of the community, cannot work because of their disabilities. Having to face a test on which one's future financial security depends is a pyschologically harrowing experience. The prospect of facing the same process again a few weeks later—merely as a result of an official's decision—is deeply worrying. My hon. Friend made an important point in this context. If the Minister does not accept the safeguards that are contained in amendment No. 196, he should explain the alternatives that he has in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0900">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>783</span>
The hon. Member for Winchester made a suggestion so briefly that I am not sure whether I fully understood it. However, two arguments suggest that the protection should not be left in the hands of the medical profession and that it should involve a fixed period. If the hon. Gentleman intended to refer only to the people who carry out the initial test, what will happen if new evidence comes to light? If he intended to refer to a person's general practitioner, I should be very concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that GPs were put in an unreasonable position was one of the reasons for our benefit integrity project and it explains why the tests changed over the years. An extremely busy GP who has to treat many genuinely sick people in his surgery should not be put under pressure by having to deal with a person who returns week after week. It was right to move the criteria away from GPs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raises an important point, but does he agree that the problem goes further? The GP is the patient's medical adviser and his first loyalty must be to his patient. By definition, therefore, he cannot make an objective medical assessment on behalf of the taxpayer or an insurance company, or when there would be a potential conflict with the patient's interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I totally agree with my hon. Friend, who makes the point more succinctly than I can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the time base that is contained in amendment No. 196, the GP's job does not involve objectivity and it would be wrong if it did. His job is to defend what he perceives to be his patient's best interests. The tests must strike a balance between the best interests of an individual and of the taxpayer, and must be fair to the community as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After long, harrowing tests, a person might be deemed to be not fit for work. It would be totally wrong if the state could say, perhaps only a few weeks after those tests at the behest of an official who does not like the individual, "You have got to go through the tests again." A safeguard is needed in that context and the second suggestion that my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford made would be sensible. I would not go to the wall over the five-year period. If the Minister makes a case for a different period, I should be happy to consider it, but if he rejects amendment No. 196, he should propose another safeguard that will protect the interests and the peace of mind of disabled people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendments and must return to the question of putting pressure on people with mental illness. Undergoing the tests could put much stress and pressure on people who are mentally ill. They will have to go through the test and they will not know whether they will have to go through it again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of my constituents is waiting to hear about an unrelated matter, but due to his mental illness and because he is expecting a letter from me—it will in fact have come from a Government Department—that poor gentleman turns up at my association office daily. He is under great stress and is regressing, so we have had to talk to the community mental health team and those who are trying to help him in a difficult situation. In his case a
	<span class='label label-info column'>784</span>
fairly small matter is concerned, but people with a mental illness may be uncertain about re-testing and we must make it clear—in the Bill, if necessary—that they will not face such pressure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another matter that I want to throw into the general debate—if it is not relevant to the amendment, I shall return to it on clause stand part—is that when mentally ill people are recovering, those who are working with them are often the best people to judge when they are able to face the stress involved in a test. There should be an option for people who are recovering from mental illness to be able to approach their personal adviser at any time and say that they feel able to take the test.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oaten</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady made the point I was trying to put across earlier better than I did. Flexibility is needed and instead of setting a rigid five-year period, surely such a conversation, as part of an interview, should set the time at which the next assessment take place. That should certainly apply to people with mental health problems and perhaps also to others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. He is right to say that the problem could apply in other circumstances. I am concentrating on mental health because it provides a graphic illustration. If someone has failed a personal capability test because he is mentally ill, that is hardly the time for him to agree when next to take the test. That may be possible in some cases, but in general it would be too prescriptive. We need flexibility because no one will know how long it will take to recover from a mental illness. There should be an element of flexibility and a five-year period could be too prescriptive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I seek an assurance from the Government that flexibility will be introduced to meet different circumstances. Stress can retrigger an illness from which someone may be recovering. I hope that amendment No. 84 will be accepted and that flexibility can be introduced for those who need it, so that the claimant can be in control of the decision on when he takes the next test and the state can say in reasonable circumstances that it is time to conduct another test.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I briefly add to what my hon. Friends have said? It was right to stress the necessity of ensuring that people are not put through the test arbitrarily. I am sympathetic to the problems faced by the Government. With any benefit, some people will receive it when they should not do so and the hon. Member for High Peak (Mr. Levitt) referred to that on an earlier amendment. New evidence may come to light and circumstances may change and it may be necessary for someone to undergo another test. We made it clear when discussing amendments on the jobseeker's allowance that the system is only as strong as its weakest link. My hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford has suggested that most officers will interpret the legislation in a reasonable manner. However, I would like to put down a marker to ensure that their interpretation is always reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham, I have had a number of such cases, and I remember a constituent who had an irregular heart beat, which caused him many problems. Under the existing regime,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0901">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>785</span>
the closer he came to his reassessment, the worse his condition became.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
3.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A degree of certainty is needed, and I am sure that that is what the Government want to achieve. I cannot believe that they want to cause more worry to people who are ill, or have a disability or mental illness, or are suffering from stress. We need to ensure that Parliament's intentions are clear. We need to draw up a system in which it is possible continuously to monitor whether someone should remain on benefit for their own good, or whether they should be taken off benefit for their own good. There is a fine balance between achieving that and ensuring that those who will find the process stressful, and who may experience additional health problems as a result, are catered for in the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the reason for the amendment. My hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford is right to call it a probing amendment. Perhaps five years would be an inappropriate period. Perhaps there is another way of measuring it. Will the Minister respond by recognising the problem and saying how he will address it, bearing in mind the need to protect the public purse?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The interchange between the hon. Member for Winchester and my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford sent me scuttling back to the exact wording of the amendment, because I thought that I had misunderstood something.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having refreshed my memory, I want to make it clear that amendment No. 196 does not propose that a reassessment should not be allowed within five years; it proposes that a second reassessment should not be allowed within five years. In terms of our discussion about whether it is best to reassess after a particular time period or on medical advice, let us assume that the vast majority of benefit officials are decent, honourable people, trying to bring together the medical advice and the anecdotal advice as to the best interests of the individual. Our amendment would give them a free hand to carry out one reassessment whenever they wished. However, in those rare cases which will occasionally occur—when an unreasonable official decides, for some vindictive reason, to pick on a claimant, a second reassessment could not take place within five years of the first, under the terms of the amendment. That is a reasonable and modest protection to build in to the Bill, and I cannot see why Ministers should object to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are times when Ministers may be conciliatory, and there are times when they have to engage in the rough and tumble of debate, and I thought that I should be engaging in the latter pursuit in this debate. However, I shall now get rid of the speech that I had prepared, because the nature of this debate demands serious answers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was going to talk about the difference between one party writing people off for five-year periods on benefits, while another tried to provide opportunities for those who want to return to work. However, that is not what this debate has been about. We shall save those issues for
	<span class='label label-info column'>786</span>
a later occasion—I do not want to divide the Committee by being too conciliatory. The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford is under notice that I shall return to that speech at an appropriate time, if I can sellotape it back together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford made the case that there are people on incapacity benefit who are deeply worried when they are asked to attend an interview, and I accept that. However, I should like to persuade him that it would be inappropriate to set a five year period within which people could not be invited for a retest, and to talk about intervals more generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On discovering the hon. Gentleman's suggestion that, once a test has established eligibility to incapacity benefit, there should be a five-year moratorium, I asked my officials to provide information on the normal periods of time between tests. I was told that the SEMA doctors, who act on behalf of the Benefits Agency, are given five options in terms of specifying intervals between subsequent tests. Those options are: three months, six months, 12 months, 18 months and "no significant change anticipated". I shall not give all the figures, but more than 50 per cent. of those who are tested are recommended for retest within 12 months or, in some cases, sooner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again, I find myself scuttling back to the text of the amendments. The Minister is dealing with the second of the two amendments, but it does not state that an individual cannot be retested within five years. Unless I have completely misunderstood the amendment, it simply states that an individual cannot have a second test within five years. If he will forgive my saying so, his points appear to relate to an amendment that is not on the amendment paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to be helpful, but I have to say that that is not my reading of the amendment. Subsection (5) is necessary to facilitate the discretionary process, which, in response to comments made by the hon. Member for Winchester and others, I shall describe in a moment. Even if two retests were allowed in a five-year period, the average interval would still be two and a half years. Seventy-three per cent. of those tested were recommended by the doctor for retesting within 18 months. In only 28 per cent. of cases was no change in the medical condition anticipated and no pre-ordained retest time set. I hope that Committee members agree that, even if it were appropriate to set a test-free period after a test, a five-year period would not be appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Department tried to discover whether people with mental health problems deteriorate before the second test? On the basis of doctors' recommendations, is there evidence to suggest that tests should be conducted after three, six, nine or 18 months?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not aware of any such research. It is difficult to imagine that one could generalise about such matters. Some sufferers from mental incapacity find that their condition worsens over time and some find that they improve, which is why we need retests. I wonder whether the hon. Lady is suggesting that the stress of a test might increase the severity of the condition. My limited understanding of medicine leads me to believe that that is unlikely in the long term. However, the Department is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0902">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>787</span>
acutely aware of the worries expressed by mental health advocacy bodies about the application of the all-work test to the mentally ill. In such cases, the test is harder to apply. Anyone who has seen the all-work test form will know that several definite indicators are used in relation to physical incapacity, and that more open questioning is used in relation to mental illness—people are asked to describe the nature of their incapacity because one cannot measure mental illness as easily as one can measure the activities of daily living—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oaten</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On mental health, evidence that I know of suggests virtually the opposite—that many people with mental health illnesses who attend the interviews perform extremely well and put much effort into the interview. They are stressed about the process and they perform above the norm, which can often cause difficulties later. The interview occurs on an exceptional day when they are eager to please, but they cannot always sustain their performance. That is one difficulty with assessing mental health.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me try to reassure Committee members. We are aware of the concerns that have been expressed. The approval process for doctors who undertake the tests stresses the need to assess people with mental health problems. We have introduced a written examination dealing with mental health, which doctors have to take. All doctors undertaking the tests carry out at least one supervised mental health examination before they conduct such examinations without supervision. Moreover, the quality of advice that is given is monitored on an on-going basis. Much work is being done by the Department's medical adviser to improve the quality of advice and guidance that is given to doctors who undertake the medical examinations on our behalf to ensure that the service is better and more consistent. Those doctors do not, of course, take decisions about eligibility for benefit—that is done by the adjudication officers. We want the highest quality of work to be carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know of individual claimants who have been tested and whose entitlements have subsequently been stopped. The test is a terribly important event for those people, who are often very angry. In some cases, a person's condition improves and he finds that he is no longer eligible for benefit. One can understand why some people react against the doctor who was one—but only one—of the people who provided advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Doug Naysmith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While we are on the subject of the tests, frequently one or two doctors in a region consistently have results that are worse than others. That is common—it does not only happen in the Bristol area, with which I am familiar. Is the Department aware of the problem and are there any statistics on it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the Department is examining the matter. I have been at the Department for only a short period, but I claim some credit in this regard. Some years ago, I went with a representative from my local citizens advice bureau to Quarry house in Leeds to meet the then chief executive of the Benefits Agency, Michael Bichard, to discuss what appeared to be inconsistencies in decisions following medical examinations. I suggested that the Benefits Agency should examine the
	<span class='label label-info column'>788</span>
frequency with which decisions on eligibility for IB were overturned on appeal, and that that should be traced back to the doctor who had made the decision. When I arrived at the Department a couple of months ago, I was pleased to discover that that is the current practice. However, one should not crudely conclude that the appeal record is an indication of a high or low standard of clinical appraisal of someone's condition—the adjudication officer's decision should be based on evidence from a specific doctor—but it is an important indicator and should be used in the quality control process. I hope that that covers the sort of problems raised by my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How would the Benefits Agency consider the reverse situation if doctors were suggesting a higher number of people for incapacity benefit? Presumably, that would not be tested by the appeals system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The test works in both ways, but I appreciate that it is not as complete a test of cases in which approval has been given because such cases do not go to appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other technical problem with the suggestion of the hon. member for Grantham and Stamford is that, from time to time, the Department needs to carry out a second assessment to discover whether something has changed. Having to wait five years before doing so would substantially undermine our ability to ensure that benefit is properly paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to return to earlier points of order, but during the debate on the money resolution in the House last night, we discussed the need for to vote an additional £15 million to write off benefit that was overpaid because of delays in instituting review procedures. A delay of five years might be appropriate in some cases, such as the 28 per cent. of cases in which no improvement is expected, but it would not be appropriate in all cases and would increase the need for to spend money on writing off overpayments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee that people are entitled to incapacity benefit for as long as they satisfy the entitlement conditions. Following the initial application of the all-work test, claims are already kept under regular review to confirm that entitlement to benefit continues. To achieve that, they may have to be retested from time to time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The social security system balances rights and responsibilities. The right to incapacity benefit brings with it a responsibility to undergo reassessment to ensure that people continue to receive benefit correctly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is our experience that many people who claim incapacity benefit believe that once they have undergone the test and satisfied it, there will be no further review or reassessment of their case. They are surprised when they are told that they need another assessment. We want people to understand that re-testing is a normal part of being on incapacity benefit and that it is part of our responsibility to check that benefit is paid in accordance with the criteria set down by Parliament. Having a specific power in legislation will help us to achieve that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0903">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>789</span>
The purpose of subsection (5) is to remove any uncertainty about the circumstances in which the test can be repeated, it puts beyond doubt the Secretary of State's power to reassess cases from time to time, whether or not new facts have come to light or there has been previous medical advice on when an improvement may occur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 196 would make it impossible for the Department to reassess a case when medical advice was that an improvement in someone's condition could be expected within a specific period or when clear evidence later emerges suggesting that an improvement has occurred. We would be left to pay benefit incorrectly to someone who was not entitled to be tested again until five years after the previous assessment. That would not be responsible stewardship of public money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the Committee that we have no intention of using the power to subject people unnecessarily to over-frequent reassessment, not least for reasons of cost, to which the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford alluded. It would be inappropriate to inconvenience the person on incapacity benefit or to use the scarce resources of a doctor to undertake a test that is not necessary. Assessments cause anxiety to some claimants and they are time-consuming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Winchester suggested that the interval before reassessment should be determined not by politicians but by those involved in determining entitlement to incapacity benefit. That is what will happen. The power is given to the Secretary of State, but it is exercised by the adjudication officers when they decide, on the basis of the advice from the Benefits Agency doctor and others, that a re-test is necessary. The intervals are therefore set in exactly the way that the hon. Member for Winchester suggests. When conducting an examination, the doctor is required to suggest the interval before re-examination and the adjudication officer will make the decision on the basis of that advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oaten</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To clarify that point, is the individual who applies for the benefit told when the next assessment is likely to take place? The individual is given no real guidelines as to when he will next have to attend an interview. Will the Minister give an assurance that individuals will be told the outcome of the decision?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At present, it is not standard procedure to tell the individual when he can expect to be reassessed. In the interests of conciliation and the improvement of public administration, I will be happy to consider whether such a procedure should be adopted. It is not a straightforward issue—we must avoid giving people the impression that they do not need to report to the Benefits Agency any changes in their circumstances, including their medical condition, in the period between assessments. The right to receive benefits comes with responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (5) is a key supporting element in our changes to incapacity benefit. It makes it absolutely clear that reassessment is a normal procedure for ensuring that re-assessment is a normal procedure for ensuring that entitlement conditions continue to be met. I therefore urge the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford to
	<span class='label label-info column'>790</span>
withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister gets at least two good marks for his performance on this amendment. First, he showed statesmanship in tearing up his original speech. That is difficult for anyone in political life, but in my experience it is almost always a good, rather than a bad, idea. I am sure that it was a good idea on this occasion, especially as his attack on the Opposition would have been ill-conceived and misdirected. Secondly, he showed initiative in persuading the Benefits Agency—during his Back-Bench days—to consider systematically variations in the outcomes of all-work tests according to the doctors who perform them. That was a splendid achievement, which helped to prepare him for his work as a Minister. I hope that he has not lost any of his initiative or willingness to innovate and that he has not become too much of a servant of the Treasury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One should always try to learn something from every sitting of the Committee, and from comments made about the amendments that one tables. In the course of the past half an hour or so, I have learnt a number of things. As I anticipated in my introductory remarks, it is clear that, notwithstanding the kind remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier), the five year period advocated in amendment No. 196 is probably not the ideal solution, and I give notice now that we shall not press that amendment to a vote. I take note of the view expressed by my hon. Friends and the hon. Member for Winchester that a greater degree of flexibility is in order than is implied by a five-year period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, I felt strengthened in my conviction that the Government's position is entirely unsatisfactory. I was surprised to learn that such a large number of all-work tests results in the recommendation of a further test after three months. Sadly, the anecdotal evidence of incapacity benefit claimants whom one meets suggests that far fewer than 73 per cent. of them can look forward to a substantive improvement in the course of a few months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Simply to set the record straight, I should say that only 3 per cent. of claimants are recommended for retesting in three months' time. Twenty-one per cent. are recommended for retesting in six months' time and 32 per cent. in 12 months' time. Therefore, 56 per cent. are recommended for retesting within 12 months. Seventeen per cent. are recommended for retesting at an 18-month interval. No retest date is set for the 28 per cent. of claimants for whom no significant change in condition is anticipated. Nevertheless, like the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford, I was surprised to discover that over 50 per cent. of claimants are recommended for retesting within a year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be interested to compare those figures with the proportion of subsequent assessments that result in assessment changes. Perhaps this is not the moment to pursue that question, but I give the Minister notice that we may pursue it in other contexts. The vast majority of doctors do an honest job on behalf of the Benefits Agency, and I hope that they will not take umbrage when I say that their profession, like any other human activity, is not immune from imperfection. One
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0904">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>791</span>
must guard against the possible theoretical risk of an institutional bias towards creating work for the panel of doctors. Perhaps the Minister will think about that subject, which we might pursue on another occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sadly, the present system does not preclude scope for the injustice and arbitrariness to which I referred when proposing amendment No. 84. As I said, the natural justice argument is a double jeopardy issue: if one is to undertake such a test, one should be clear about the result for a defined period. I thought that the Minister was about to say that, in future, people should at least know the period for which their assessment will be valid. Such a statement could influence our decision on the amendment. Although we shall probably not vote in favour of the clause and are in no way committed to the idea of the assessment that will replace the all-work test, I have used the new terminology of assessment. We agreed earlier that the change is essentially semantic. If there is no substantive difference, it does not matter which of the available words I use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The double jeopardy argument, and therefore a large part of the natural justice argument, would effectively be addressed if the Minister were to say that there would be defined periods, albeit periods that would be specific to the case in question, and periods that a doctor would have recommended to have elapsed before the next assessment should take place. That would be a good solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought for a wonderful moment that the Minister, as he began that sentence, was going to conclude it by saying that he was going to make that concession. Instead, he merely said that he would think about it. That is not good enough. This is a serious matter and a principle of natural justice. I am glad that he will think about it and I am sure that he probably agrees with it generally, but his decision means that we must hold open the option of denying the Government this subsection until we know what conclusion he has reached. If we cannot achieve that purpose ourselves, I want to put down a marker that may enable others to do so, either on the Floor of the House or in another place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other aspect of natural justice in this case, which I outlined earlier, is arbitrariness, which the Government do not propose to deal with, and is not dealt with in the present arrangements. That, too, could have been effectively tackled by the concession that I thought that the Minister was about to make to the Committee. If someone had been told that they would be reassessed in six or 18 months, that would remove the possibility of a Benefits Agency employee using pressure or harassing them by compelling them to have otiose tests that would place burdens on the claimant and on the taxpayer who has to pay for unnecessary assessments. Greater clarity and discipline is required, both for the assessors and the people being assessed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not happy with subsection (5). It does not remove doubt, as the Minister suggested. It does the reverse and creates the maximum degree of doubt, because there will be complete uncertainty under the regime that it will establish. No one will know when they might be subject to an assessment and no reason would
	<span class='label label-info column'>792</span>
have to be given to them. There is no counterweight here to the arbitrary power that the Government propose to give the Benefits Agency and no disciplines that could be exerted over the exercise of that power. That creates the maximum scope for doubt, rather than removing it, which is not satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that I shall carry my hon. Friends with me on this matter and I should be happy if we could also carry Liberal Democrat Members, even if we do not carry any Labour Members with us. This is complicated, so we must get it right: with your permission, Mr. McWilliam, I should like to put amendment No. 84 to the vote, but not amendment No. 196, which I would like to withdraw.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I have carefully considered the situation regarding clause stand part. It is a narrow clause, which, apart from one little bit, has been pretty well chewed up. I warn the Committee that it is not in order to rake over coals that have already been well raked over. Repetition is out of order, not only in single debates on groups of amendments, but in debates on the clause to which the amendments relate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has turned down the invitation to speak. It is always interesting to see the Government so little proud of their legislative proposals that they do not want to take the opportunity to present them to Parliament. We saw another example of that last night on the Floor of the House. It is left to the Opposition to make the running in the clause stand part debate. That is the position we are in now, and it speaks for itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate on the amendments was revealing and illustrated the necessity of a Committee stage, even when a Government have the kind of overwhelming majority that this new Labour Government have. In such debates we manage to prise out of the Government, however reluctantly, some recognition as to the reality of their legislative proposals, making it possible for the public to see past the gloss, the PR and the spin to the real content. The real content is often pretty unattractive, as it is in this case.

	<span class='label label-info column'>793</span>
The first thing that we established in the debate on the amendments was that, except for a few extra questions on the form directed at various activities that someone might do, there is absolutely no difference in substance between the all-work test and the personal capability assessment. We were given the important assurance that there would be no difference in the outcomes of the personal capability assessment compared with the all-work test—anyone who passed the one will pass the other, and anyone who failed the one will fail the other. That assurance is important, not least for those who will have to undergo the new assessment. I might as well use the terms all-work test and personal capability assessment interchangeably, because there is no difference in substance between them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I suggested that Committee members should not indulge in raking over old coals, but that is all the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford has done up to now. I remember distinctly the arguments that took place this morning and earlier this afternoon, and I do not need to be reminded of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the things that you would probably have ruled out of order, Mr. McWilliam, in the debate on the amendments—although I trust that you will not rule me out of order when I say it in the clause stand part debate—is that this provision is a prime example of how the Government speak with forked tongue. To one audience they say one thing, and to another audience, they say another. I am sure that you know, Mr. McWilliam—as do all the disability orgaiiisations, many of whom are represented in this Room, although they cannot show even by a nod of the head that they agree with what I am saying—that since the election, the Government have gone around saying that the all-work test is a nasty, wicked Tory device and that they would replace it with an entirely different concept—something much more sophisticated and positive called the personal capability assessment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is not in order for the hon. Gentleman, every time I rule him out of order for being repetitive, to move to another repetitive argument which I have already ruled out of order. The question concerns the contents of clause 50 as it stands, not what went before.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that you will acknowledge, Mr. McWilliam, that the purpose and effect of clause 50 is to replace the all-work test with the new so-called "personal capability assessment". I trust, therefore, that you think that is in order, when Parliament is invited to replace one regime with another, to discuss in a clause stand part debate the essential differences between the first regime, which is being replaced, and the second, which is replacing it. That is exactly what I was attempting to do. It is important to identify the difference between the first and the second regime and to bring out the differences in what the Government have been saying about their intentions outside this place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is now clear that the personal capability assessment has been the subject of a major mis-selling campaign. It was mis-sold as being something different; it has now been acknowledged to be no different at all and to
	<span class='label label-info column'>794</span>
make no difference whatever. We heard that acknowledgement—indeed, that assurance—from the Minister, and it is important. There will be no difference to the outcomes for somebody who undergoes the test or assessment. That is an extremely important and substantive point. It is also an important indication of how the Government conduct their business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 50 (1) explicitly provides for the personal capability assessment to apply in the same way as the all-work test.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[MR. JONATHAN SHAW 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for my hon. Friend's support. The fact that I am allowed still to be on my feet shows that that is the case. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Perhaps I shall now be subject to an even stricter regime.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You may well be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely glad that I got in my remarks about forked tongues while Mr. McWilliam was still in the Chair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other issue on which we really must dwell is whether it would be sensible for us to replace the all-work test with something that was genuinely different, more nuanced to individual circumstances and more positive in the sense of determining what activities someone might be capable of if he was given certain types of help, support or training. In the light of our debate this afternoon, that challenge clearly needs to be met by the next Conservative Administration. I make no assumption about the conclusions to which we might come because it would be quite wrong to do so. I simply say that the task is open.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several things are profoundly wrong with the all-work test. It has not been very efficient and has, in many cases, been unfair. It is too often perfunctory and carried out rapidly. People are assessed on the basis of their best possible performance. In some ways, the system is programmed to fail people where there is doubt. Although it should, the test takes no account of people's ability not merely to do a job but to get to work, stay the course and do the hours that are required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I have suffered from in my back in the past few weeks is minor compared with the problems that people who qualify for incapacity benefit suffer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[MR. JOHN MCWILLIAM 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>My problem is, I hope, temporary and despite it I have been able to do almost anything for a brief period.</p>
	<p>However, a few weeks ago something like sitting down to have a meal or sitting in the Committee would, after half an hour or so, become thoroughly agonising. One can learn from every experience in life, including misfortunes. Although my misfortune was minor, it has given me an insight into an aspect of the issue that now confronts us. A test that is designed to assess people in the course of a brief period of time—sometimes not much more than 10 minutes, much of which will be taken up ticking boxes on a form—may result in a completely unfair assessment of someone's ability to do a sustained job of work.</p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0906">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>795</span>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>A person may be able to do something momentarily, and perform certain acts when asked to do so in front of a doctor, but may not be able to do so on a sustained and regular basis under the kind of pressure that exists in a work environment. The Government have no real sympathy with the criticisms of the all-work test—it is feigned sympathy, as we have discovered. They have come up with something that merely changes the word rather than the substance. I have sympathy with the criticisms, and it remains a challenge—for the next Government, if the current one will not undertake it—to devise a more effective, efficient and fair test.</p>
	<p>Another issue was rightly raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham, although she did so only glancingly. That was no doubt due to her fear of you, Mr. McWilliam, which we all share and suffer from.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady and I have been friends for a long time and she is not afraid of me in any regard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, Mr. McWilliam, she is exceptional among mortals. However, when she dared to mention the words "therapeutic earnings" in the context of an earlier discussion on amendment No. 84, I believe that you were about to rule her out of order. I trust that you will not rule me out of order if I raise the issue now, Mr. McWilliam, unless my hon. Friend is trying to catch your eye in order to do so herself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I shall not pre-empt my hon. Friend. I am glad that she plans to raise the matter, because it is important in terms of the clause and I am sure that she is the right person to do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to you, Mr. McWilliam, for allowing a clause stand part debate, and I shall not try to exploit your indulgence by speaking for too long. I reiterate that the debate has revealed the true nature of the new personal capability assessment—it is largely the same regime. That is in some ways reassuring, because we have lived with it and know that it could have become something worse. Equally, however, it is disappointing, because an opportunity to improve matters has self-evidently not been taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also established, once again, that the Government display a wide gap between rhetoric and reality. They are happy to say one thing in Parliament and another outside it. The explanatory notes state on page 89 that the personal capability assessment
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the most part mirrors the existing provision for the All Work Test".</p></blockquote>
We all know about the propaganda that has been undertaken outside the House—very effective propaganda, as propaganda often is—to persuade people that there is something new in the substance of the proposals, whereas in reality there is not. There are lessons to be drawn from that on how we assess the rest of the Government's proposals in the Bill and in other contexts. I know, Mr. McWilliam, that you like from time to time to hear Latin quotations, so I shall end my
	<span class='label label-info column'>796</span>
remarks with one that has just occurred to me that is appropriate to the Government's behaviour in this context. I think that it comes from the second book of the Aeneid:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Accipe nunc Danaeum insidias, et Crimine ab uno Disce omnes."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to be able to refer to the subject to which I referred glancingly and on which I sought your advice earlier, Mr. McWilliam. I am also grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford for allowing me to concentrate on therapeutic earnings; if he had wanted to dilate on it, I would of course have weaved around the edges and added to the general total of human knowledge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that we consider the whole issue of therapeutic earnings when discussing the clause. It may be helpful in maintaining or improving people's self-esteem and improving some mental and physical health conditions if they can, under a doctor's recommendation, be encouraged to perform some therapeutic work. Needless to say, I have a relevant constituency case in which a person suffering from depression was encouraged to take up some therapeutic work. His wife, who owns a business, gave him such work. The accountant made a mistake and paid him £2 over his weekly limit and the Benefits Agency is now claiming back incapacity benefit over a long time on the basis of some poor advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was a rare case in which someone was doing therapeutic work. Under the clause, how will the Government encourage therapeutic work, which may contribute to people's recovery or maintenance of self-esteem? The problem is complex because benefits, hours of work, the complexities of medical advice and people's knowledge of whether they can or cannot undertake therapeutic work interact. At present, it can be done only on the advice of a doctor. It would be helpful if people who felt able to undertake some therapeutic work were encouraged to do so in discussions with their personal adviser as part of the personal capability test, and if such work could be included as a category of achievement to which the person could look forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The use of work as therapy falls under the changed regime introduced by the Bill and needs much more positively to be taken into account in the thinking of personal advisers and the structure of the personal capability assessment. Given its potential, it could be used much more constructively than it has been.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister briefly mentioned the other area that I want to I speak about, and which I was planning to mention in this clause stand part debate anyway: that is the training that doctors receive. I am sure that most members of the Committee have had constituency cases that involve a dispute between someone who has undertaken the all-work test and the doctor or personal adviser about what was achieved at the test, who did what, how long it took, how great a depth of testing was undertaken and—to return to a subject that we have already discussed—what percentage of any information passed to people they absorbed at any one time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister gave me to understand that a greater depth of training was undertaken for doctors carrying out such tests. I should be grateful if he would reassure me
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0907">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>797</span>
that doctors and personal advisers are being carefully trained to try to ensure that what they are telling a person is not simply heard but thoroughly understood. In that way, the percentage of the information and advice being absorbed and understood would be considerably higher than 10 per cent. That comes down largely to training and it is crucial when it comes to doctors undertaking assessments. If the Minister could give us more details about how the doctors are being trained in developing the tests effectively, I should be most grateful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make two brief points to build on what my hon. Friend said about therapeutic work. Due to the nature of the amendments so far debated, we have been discussing the narrow question of whether someone qualifies for incapacity benefit. There is another piece to the jigsaw and perhaps the Minister, who has considerable knowledge, could explore the subject of getting people off incapacity benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two or three weeks ago, the Minister and I both served on a Standing Committee that considered a statutory instrument. Regulations were introduced to ensure that people could have an opportunity to start the process of getting back to work, to try it out for a time without any loss of benefit. It emerged from that debate that the regulations giving people that opportunity did not apply to part-time work. I think that the Minister originally thought that they did, but the explanatory notes demonstrated otherwise. Has the hon. Gentleman given any further thought to that anomaly, given that we want to give people the confidence and experience that comes from going back into the workplace and getting used to regular hours and the community of work. Conservative and Liberal Democrat Members of that Committee supported the regulations. As it is not possible to amend existing regulations, this seems a good point at which to raise the matter. It is a pretty good way of getting people back to work and giving them vital experience of the rigours of the workplace. They are secure in the knowledge that if it does not work out, that evidence will not be used against them in their personal capability assessment. Has the Minister further considered extending the regulations or introducing new ones to ensure that part-time work can be included?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for my second point, the hon. Member for High Peak tempted me to mention it, but you rightly reigned me in, Mr. McWilliam, on the basis that it was more appropriate to a stand part debate. I refer to the Secretary of State's statement that a number of people claim incapacity benefit because of dubious medical assessments. We know that there is no intention of changing the medical assessments substantially. The Government remain silent about how exactly they intend to attack the problem of dubious medical assessments. How will they go about the process, because nothing in clause 50 gives us any indication? Are the Government guilty of a spin, as my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford has so eloquently said on many occasions, or is there some substance? If it is a question of second-guessing medical advice, the authority should be consulted and we should receive some explanation. I look forward to hearing the Minister's reaction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>798</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have received an object lesson on the reasons for not making conciliatory speeches, and my hon. Friends will remind me of the importance of such an approach. Having been so conciliatory during debate of the amendments, I have suddenly been lambasted by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford. In view of his lack of faith in the new Labour Government, and as he so fond of classical quotations, I say to him
	<br><blockquote><p>"Esto fideles usque ad mortem et Deum dabat tibi coronan vitae".</p></blockquote>
While he is pondering the source, I should express my sympathy with the discomfort that he has suffered in his back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman made an important point. The all-work test specifically takes account of whether a person can, for example, stand for more than one minute, 10 minutes or 30 minutes. One of the aims of the assessment is to find out whether a person can sustain the type of activities necessary in work. Account is also taken of pain and fatigue caused by repeated or sustained activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Beckenham asked about the doctors involved in the all-work test. I should defend the doctors employed through SEMA. Those who carry out medical examinations are all required to be fully registered with the General Medical Council and to have relevant clinical experience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am practically speechless. The last thing that I would do for a moment is to suggest that the doctors used in the tests are not fully qualified. I am suggesting merely that they require some other skills, mainly communication skills. Anybody who has talked to doctors knows that most of them need such skills. That is where doctors need training, not in any medical capacity. I would not for a moment cast any aspersions on doctors' abilities in that direction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that reinterpretation. The hon. Lady suggested that the doctors involved needed further training. Doctors are fully and appropriately trained, and efforts are constantly being made to make that training as full and as appropriate as possible. As well as being fully qualified and having relevant clinical experience, doctors also have to be approved by the Secretary of State for making a disability assessment. The approval process requires doctors to undergo a formal training course, to pass written examinations and to demonstrate their practical skills and confidence in relation to the all-work test. The Secretary of State's chief medical adviser issues guidance on the minimum standards expected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Currently, training is supervised by a medical validation group that uses outside experts and is chaired by the chief medical adviser. Doctors are allowed to conduct incapacity tests only after passing the examination to a standard acceptable to the validation group. The Committee may be interested to know that that system will he replaced by a new diploma in disability assessment medicine. The new initiative is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0908">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>799</span>
under the aegis of the faculty for occupational medicine of the Royal College of Physicians, and is being developed by the Department's chief medical adviser.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry if the hon. Member for Beckenham felt that I misrepresented her views, which are clearly on record. I am certain, however, that concerns such as those expressed will be reflected in the improved training that is being developed for the doctors' understanding of the tests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Rendel 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am even more confused by what the Minister is saying than by what the Government have said in the past. My understanding is that the Government have claimed that the incapacity benefit regulations have been used by a lot of people so that they might retire early. People had also used the regulations so that they might not take up work when they otherwise could, going on incapacity benefit instead. I inferred from that that people were being allowed to go on incapacity benefit who should not have been—who were not sufficiently incapable of working—and that possibly they were doing that as a way of overcoming the difficulty of not being able to retire early.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder now about what the Government say about how they will reduce the use of incapacity benefit to stop more people appearing in the unemployment statistics. I think that that was what the Minister was accusing the previous Government of having done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The remarks that I have just made were to defend the level of professional confidence in the training provided to doctors to allow them to make appropriate assessments. I am sure that we will debate further the wider political point about the number of people eligible for incapacity benefit under the present arrangements. Medical advisers will be employed for the personal capability assessment—the matter under consideration. They and SEMA—the contractors—will be required to monitor the consistency of decisions. However, we have no evidence that individual doctors make assessments that are out of line with the norm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar asked questions about part-time work that were not especially relevant to the clause. We may be able to return to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause will replace the all-work test with the personal capability assessment and introduce two new provisions. The first will allow the process of assessment to start earlier than it can at present, and the second will make it clear that the assessment may be repeated periodically during the period of entitlement to benefit to ensure that people continue to satisfy the conditions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister planning to return to the issue of therapeutic earnings?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that we had discussed that issue at some length; I was not planning to return to it. The issue is not relevant to the creation of a new personal capability assessment I, and even the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford, believe that I might be ruled out of order if I respond to the point. However, I recognise that the hon. Lady raised the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have no intention of tightening the gateway to
	<span class='label label-info column'>800</span>
incapacity benefit, or of including a test of employability. People who fulfil the current entitlement criteria will continue to do so. There will be no change to the threshold of incapacity above which benefit will be disallowed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I must make progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford expressed surprise and pleasure when I indicated clearly that the medical criteria for entitlement to incapacity benefit will not change. However, that point had been made abundantly clear. On Second Reading, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I gave an undertaking earlier that the medical test for incapacity benefit will remain the same, but we are adding the capacity test to ensure that we have a better chance of finding out what people can do rather than what they cannot do."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 23 February 1999; Vol. 326, c. 223.]</p></blockquote>
That intention is at the core of the change. The clause will change the law in that respect because we want to make it clear that passing the threshold for entitlement to benefit does not mean that people have no hope of working again, and that they must resign themselves to spending the rest of their lives on benefit. Many people who satisfy the test criteria might be capable of work if they had the right help and support. Indeed, 100,000 of them move from incapacity benefit into work every year. We are introducing the single gateway to benefits and personal advisers to give people just that sort of support, so that they can fulfil their aspirations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are taking powers in part II of schedule 8 to add value to the all-work test process by using it to collect additional information about people's capability for work. Much useful information is already generated in the process, but it is not put to best use. We want to capture all the relevant information in the capability report, which will be passed to the claimant's personal adviser, so that he or she has the necessary information to provide the client with an effective, tailored service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new, positive role is reflected in the main personal capability assessment that the clause introduces. Subsection (4) enables the personal capability assessment to be carried out earlier than the all-work test. Currently, the all-work test process begins immediately for those who do not have a recent work record, but for most people it will not start until the 29th week of incapacity. During that initial period, they will receive either statutory sick pay or, if they are on incapacity benefit but have a recent work record, the own-occupation test will apply. The outcome will be known some time after the all-work test process in the 29th week and the delay could be as much as 20 weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the interests of claimants, who should not be kept in doubt about their entitlement, and of the official administration of benefit, the process should start sooner. When the personal capability assessment is introduced, it will be sensible to ensure that information that could help to support an early return to work is available as soon as possible. If, as we intend, the personal capability assessment can be started a few weeks before the 29th week, a final decision will be possible sooner than is currently the case.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oaten</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I presume that the outcome of the assessment will also be made available to the claimant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the Under-Secretary took umbrage at my comments about him. I paid tribute to his conciliatory tone and gestures—as I said, tearing up his speech was a conciliatory gesture—but, unfortunately, the conciliation ended there. The Committee deals not with tone and gesture but with substance, and he made no concessions. No doubt the virtue is his and the vice is new Labour's. I suspect that he wants to be conciliatory, but that his Treasury masters do not allow him to be. My strictures about the new Labour regime were therefore harsh, but right. I was not, however, personally unfriendly to the Under-Secretary—nothing that he has said has given me cause to be, although we are disappointed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must touch on two important matters—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Gentleman does that, I should say, belatedly, that hon. Gentlemen may remove their jackets. I am feeling tolerant today. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] They do not have to do so, but they may. It is probably fortunate that "Erskine May" has no rules about taste in braces. Committee members are probably thinking more about tearing up the M1 than about tearing up speeches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take your hint, Mr. McWilliam. The fashion parade that results when hon. Members take off their jackets is always fascinating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot let the Government get away with their dismissal of the point about therapeutic earnings. My hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham made a good speech on that subject, about which she is very knowledgeable. I gather that she is writing a note to the Under-Secretary, and I hope that she will get a satisfactory response.

Once again, it is clear that it is the new Labour Government's instinct to take no notice of what the
	<span class='label label-info column'>802</span>
outside world says to them. We—and, I am sure, the Government—received a note from the Disability Benefits Consortium that asked Committee members to seek a general commitment on therapeutic work from the Government during our debate on clause 50. It wants a specific commitment to alter regulation 17(1)(a) of the Social Security (Incapacity for Work) (General) Regulations 1995. The DBC wants to delete the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"which causes that person's incapacity for work;"</p></blockquote>
from paragraph (1)(a)(i) of that regulation, which deals with work that is undertaken on the advice of a doctor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The DBC's briefing makes a strong case for its view. The Government have obviously not listened to the DBC, and the Under-Secretary tried to dismiss the powerful arguments of my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham. With your consent, Mr. McWilliam, I shall therefore inflict the DBC's briefing on the Under-Secretary. I have great confidence that, even with your unfailingly close scrutiny of the relevance of everything that I say, you will agree that this is not an inappropriate juncture in our proceedings at which to raise this important matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. If I may assist the hon. Gentleman, quoting from documents is allowed, but reading from them in full, or in part, is not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I accept your ruling, Mr. McWilliam—I always do—but I do so on but the basis that what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. I know you are a fair-minded—and strict-minded—man. I can think of only one other occasion during the Committee's proceedings when I have read out any documents. I hope that I may be allowed to do so on a couple of occasions. My opposite numbers—if I may refer to them as such—the Minister of State, the Under-Secretary and the Minister seem to have benefited from your indulgence in this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It was not my indulgence. If the hon. Gentleman cares to consult Erskine May he will find that Ministers are allowed to consult their notes more copiously than ordinary mortals. Whether or not that is fair is a matter of conjecture, but it is in Erskine May.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is certainly not fair. I will not argue with the umpire, but I will argue with the rule book. I should like another opportunity to take the matter up. I shall proceed, Mr. McWilliam, and if you tell me to stop, I shall do so. The quotation seems to me to be extremely relevant to our debate, and describes the position more expertly than I could in my own words. The briefing states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Therapeutic earnings allow people in Incapacity Benefit, Severe Disablement Allowance or Income Support with a disability premium to do some work on the advice of a doctor, as long as the work is less than 16 hours a week. The earnings limit is £48 per week (£58 from April 5"—</p></blockquote>
I shall pass over the rest of the sentence. The briefing continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Take up of therapeutic work is low and regulations in force from 1995 have made it impossible for people with unchanging disabilities to have access to therapeutic work. Therapeutic work should be an
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0910">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>803</span>
option that a personal adviser can discuss with the disabled person under the single gateway."</p></blockquote>
That is implied criticism—with which I wish to associate myself—of something that happened in 1995. The other Conservative Members on the Committee and I have never taken the view that everything that happened under the previous Government was perfect. The Labour party won the last general election on the basis that they would improve things. In this context, and in many others, it is of no use to say, "You guys weren't any better". That is a pathetic justification for the new Labour regime. The briefing continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Before April 1995, it was possible to undertake therapeutic work if 'good cause' could be shown. The 'good cause' had to be on a doctor's recommendation and certainly included work that could provide exercise or take a person's mind off their disability. The 'good cause' rules were not intended to allow people who were able to work, to work and claim benefits, nor were they intended to allow people on Invalidity Benefit to boost their income or work for a wide range of non medical reasons. In other words, the work had to be therapeutic.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>From April 1995 therapeutic work is only allowable for people who work less than 16 hours a week. The work can only be undertaken if on the advice of a doctor, it helps to improve, or prevent or delay deterioriation in the disease or bodily or mental disablement, which causes the incapacity for work."</p></blockquote>
Given those provisions, it is impossible for someone o enjoy the derogation in favour of therapeutic work if their condition is stable. That is thoroughly unsatisfactory. The Government—with their wonderful new rhetoric—had an opportunity to make an improvement to the system. But they did not even listen to the representations made to them, and took no notice of the submissions from outside bodies. They cast aside the serious case made by my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman will relay my remarks to the hon. Member for Beckenham, who has to attend to some business outside the Committee Room for a few minutes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will consider in more detail the question of widening the provision's scope to include therapeutic work that helps people's general rehabilitation prospects. The doctor who performs the personal capability assessment will be able to make recommendations on whether certain types of work will be beneficial to the person's condition. Personal advisers will be able to raise awareness of therapeutic work and help people to understand the relevant rules.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for those comments. Perhaps we are making progress after all. The Minister's response may justify not only my raising the point but you allowing me, Mr. McWilliam, to quote fairly copiously from the briefing, for which I am also grateful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At this stage in the debate on clause 50, not all of which has been entirely satisfactory from our point of view, I should like to modify something that I said earlier. I said that, in replacing the all-work test with the personal capability assessment, the Government had been speaking with forked tongue. That is normally understood to mean speaking with two different voices, or giving two different messages, to two different audiences. However, I was wrong to give the impression that it was only two different messages—the fork is
	<span class='label label-info column'>804</span>
actually a three-way fork. The Government have been giving three different messages to three different audiences. To the disability organisations and the parts of public opinion that are concerned with the humanity of our benefits system and the extent to which it supports those who are suffering temporary or permanent misfortune, the Government's message has been: "Vote Labour and we will get rid of this nasty all-work test and replace it with something better—a system that is more positive and takes greater account of individuals' circumstances."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A different message went out to people who are concerned about public expenditure. The hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel) made a telling intervention about that before the sitting was suspended. Many people are concerned about public expenditure, especially the difficulty that the Government have had in delivering their commitment to reducing social security spending in absolute terms as a proportion of public expenditure to create room for more spending on health, education and other matters. To those people, the Government have been saying, "The new Labour Government will ensure that we no longer have a situation in which there is an excessive number of people on incapacity benefit. The Tories allowed too many people to get that benefit, which was very inefficient, and part of welfare reform must be to ensure that those people get off incapacity benefit and move on to the jobseeker's allowance or get off benefit altogether." That message, which has been delivered to a different audience, is entirely inconsistent with the first message. One cannot have it both ways, but the Government are trying to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the course of today's proceedings, we have heard a third message: "Don't worry, nothing has actually changed at all. It is still the all-work test. The whole thing was just semantics; the play of lights and mirrors. We are grateful for the assurances—although it was extracted with some difficulty—that individuals who face a personal capability assessment will find it no more difficult to pass, to qualify for benefit, than the all-work test. That is a third inconsistency. The Government cannot have it all these ways. The message is being delivered not by a forked tongue, but by a three-way split. It is up to Parliament to ensure that Governments do not get away with such inconsistencies and are held to account. I now feel that my Latin quotation was particularly appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I enjoyed the Under-Secretary's quotation, which appeared to indicate a mystical attachment to new Labour. He clearly gained a sort of sublime inspiration from the contemplation of the Prime Minister, Alastair Campbell and the rest of the crew. I can understand that he may think that they are effective as political players, at least in the short term, but I was surprised by the idea that they deserve the degree of religious fervour that was indicated by the quotation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My quotation came from the mouth of a rather sensible Trojan, who uses the words at the end of the second book of the Aeneid after the Trojans have been taken in by the Trojan horse. He is saying, "Learn now of the tricks of Danaum,"—for whom we can substitute new Labour,"—and from the wickedness of one, learn of the wickedness of all." That is why we must draw general
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0911">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>805</span>
conclusions from the business of speaking with forked tongues and trying to bemuse and bamboozle different sections of the public with different and inconsistent messages. That is a theme that does not merely emerge from the revelations this afternoon on clause 50 but crystallises the essence of the con trick that has been played on the British public by the new Labour Administration and all the spin doctors who accompany them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the sad lack of genuine concessions on the part of the Government on some of the issues on which we feel strongly, and because such inconsistencies continue, we should retain the existing regime in substance instead of in shadow. We see no reason to go along with the trick of pretending to replace the all-work test with something else. As far as I can tell, the only genuine change that has emerged is that you may have the personal capability assessment imposed on you earlier than the all-work test. No other change has emerged. It would be more honest to retain the previous regime in form as well as in substance; we shall therefore resist the inclusion of the clause in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before our sitting was suspended, the Minister made some important points about the status of medical records, to which I want briefly to return. I understood from what the Minister said that the medical records taken from the new capability test would be made available to those doing the interviews, but not to claimant. Can the Minister confirm whether that is accurate? If so, are any legal issues involved, given the changes that have been made to patients' access to medical records? I should be grateful if the Minister would confirm whether that has been checked and approved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no question of medical records being given to an adjudication officer; it is a matter of the personal capability assessment being given to the personal adviser. It should go to the adviser and the adviser should discuss it with the benefit claimant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oaten</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that clarification. At what stage in the process will the claimant be able to spot any misinformation, errors or factual mistakes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two separate issues here. Part of the personal capability assessment, which relates to eligibility for incapacity benefit, can be reconsidered by a review or appeal in the normal way. The discussion that takes place with the personal adviser in the single gateway will range over all matters which the personal adviser or the person on incapacity benefit wants to raise. The idea is to create a forum in which discussion is useful to the claimant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard Flight 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Arundel and South Downs)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I have understood the Minister correctly, nothing results
	<span class='label label-info column'>806</span>
from the new capability test. Although people's capability will be assessed in interviews, that will in no way affect their financial entitlement to incapacity benefit. People may qualify on medical grounds, and even if jobs are available to them and they have the capability to do them, there will be no pressure on them to take such jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To illustrate the point raised by the hon. Member for Newbury, I do not want to get our joint county ambulance service into trouble, but I visited it the other day. It is a good service, but I was advised among other things that the big wheeze was incapacity benefit and early retirement. There was general planning of when people would stop working early on some form of incapacity benefit. As they get older, it is of course easy for people who lift others into ambulances to get back problems such as those experienced by my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford. That situation is starting to impose some strain on pension arrangements for people who work in the ambulance service as well as giving rise to incapacity benefit. It would be better to regularise the situation through an early retirement age. Given that such wheezes exist in relation to incapacity benefit, the clause will not change matters at all in terms of assessing capability to work. I seek confirmation from the Minister through my little illustration that that is clearly the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All that I can say is that pension entitlements and their relation to incapacity benefit crop up under clause 52 and that is the appropriate place to discuss them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I just wanted to make a brief contribution, which may help the Committee. I am afraid that we have returned to the cloying consensus that existed on earlier parts of the Bill. Broadly speaking, the Conservative Opposition support the Government's move with regard to joint claims for jobseeker's allowance, although we have some reservations about
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0912">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>807</span>
the odd change, which may require some explanation when we deal with schedule 7.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should put the Minister on notice about one small thing. I am not entirely clear from the memorandum or the Jobseekers Act 1995 what the effect of the changes to section 1(2) of the Act will be on the calculation of people's incoming capital value in particular. I am concerned about the effect of adaptations with regard to disability. If the Minister could consider the matter and let me know what the position is before our deliberations are through, that would satisfy me. Otherwise, I am happy to proceed at some speed, providing that we make no further references to the Trojan wars and people in braces.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Obviously, I cannot constrain members of the Committee in what they try to mention. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not feeling sensitive about his braces.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Employment, Welfare to Work and Equal Opportunities (Mr. Andrew Smith)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Last time I dealt with a clause, a happy harmony broke out in the Committee. Notwithstanding the fact that there were lots of amendments, we progressed somewhat faster. I hope that we will follow that precedent in relation to the clause to which we have now come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 48 is necessary to give effect to schedule 7. Perhaps I may take your advice, Mr. McWilliam. Do I speak to the amendments to schedule 7 now, or do we dispose of clause 48 first and then move on?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is quite clear. Clause 48 merely gives effect to the schedule. The amendments apply to the schedule, which will be separately debated and voted on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I shall simply address the clause briefly and tackle the points of substance when we reach schedule 7.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 48 is a recognition of the change in society which means that it is no longer appropriate simply to treat dependants as passive recipients of benefit. Where one of a couple is in the 18-to-24 age range and the couple have no children, we propose to introduce this joint regime so that both must comply with active labour market requirements. The provision will grow with the couple with the passage of time. Progressively, therefore, childless couples will be required to be actively engaged with the labour market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I looked up some statistics that back up this measure. Some 90 per cent. of dependents are women. The figure for the participation in the labour force of those in the 25-to-30 age group who are not claimants is remarkable. Of course, that is the age group immediately above the one that we are discussing, but it is relevant because the position is not complicated by the presence of so many students in that group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not know before that the proportion of women aged 25 to 30 who are married or cohabiting, who have no children and who work, is no less than 94 per cent. That is a very high proportion indeed and sets a context in which it is entirely appropriate that we should expect a recipient of the jobseeker's allowance in the 18-to-24 age
	<span class='label label-info column'>808</span>
range without children to be fully engaged with the labour market. Moreover, if they have been unemployed for six months or if special circumstances apply before then, they will enjoy all the benefits of full participation in the new deal for young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus, the measure takes into account the change that there has been in society and the happy level of women's participation in the labour market. It is a matter of basic equity. The clause should be supported, as should the schedule to which we shall come shortly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amdendment provides that one of the polygamous partners should be nominated as the one to whom the requirement of the joint claim will apply. I considered carefully whether it would be possible for the requirement to apply to all the partners who did not have children, but the number of cases we are talking about in the social security system is so small—and the complexity and administrative costs involved so great—that it is not worth it.

For the purposes of social security, polygamous marriages are recognised if they have been made in a country where they are legal. People in such marriages receive usual payment for couples in respect of one wife, and an additional payment representing the difference between a single person's payment and that of a couple for each of the other wives. I am assured that the clause has been

Amendments Nos. 233 and 234 are minor technical amendments that ensure that the cross-references made in sections 2(1) and 3(1) of the Jobseekers Act 1995 to section 1(2) are correct. Amendment No. 235 permits the Secretary of State to exercise discretion to make payments to the member of a joint-claim couple who is not the nominated member. Such provision is clearly important for cases of alcoholism, abuse and so on. Amendment No. 236 makes a minor drafting change, ensuring that the wording of new section 4A(2)(b) is consistent with the wording of existing section 4(7)(b) of the Jobseekers Act.

Amendments Nos. 237 and 243 amend section 31 of the Jobseekers Act 1995 and section 124(1)(f) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 respectively to cater for joint-claim couples.

This is a probing amendment, whose aim is to ensure that the Government have the opportunity to make their intentions clear. One or two organisations have been slightly concerned at the precise wording of the Bill, especially at something that appears in the explanatory notes which state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"where the claimant who has not breached the rules meets JSA contribution conditions, he will be paid an amount of income-based JSA equivalent to the rate of contribution-based JSA for the duration of the period of the sanction".</p></blockquote>
That has led some people to believe that there might be means-testing for those on contribution-based jobseeker's allowance. I believe that the Child Poverty Action Group has been in touch with the DSS, which gave the assurance that that is not the intention, but as there is some ambiguity here, we want to press the Government to make it plain that that is not their intention.

Where that is contribution-based, it should be at the contribution rate. Where it is income-based, it will be subject to means-testing. Relatively few people in the 18-to-24 age group will receive the contribution-based entitlement because most of them will not have had time to build up their entitlement, but those who have accrued the entitlement will receive it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rendel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to have the Minister's confirmation that that is the Government's intention.

	<div class='title'>SPECIAL SCHEMES FOR CLAIMANTS FOR JOBSEEKER'S ALLOWANCE</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 238, in page 48, leave out lines 3 to 5.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 239.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are technical amendments. Amendment No. 238 removes clause 49(2)(c). As the Bill stands, subsection (2)(c) expressly allows for the making of regulations that would confer an entitlement to a lump sum on employment zone participants. This is unnecessary, as the mechanisms for funding participants will be laid down in our contracts with delivery agents. Those contracts will ensure that those participating in employment zones receive an allowance at least equivalent to the money that they previously received in jobseeker's allowance. They will also allow delivery agents some discretion to decide what additional moneys they can pay participants. Removing the subsection will not affect the amount of funding available. The amendment is therefore entirely consistent with the greater flexibility that we want to provide in employment zones and I imagine that the Committee will welcome it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 239 corrects an anomaly that could prevent any employment zone run by an executive agency from paying its participants anything other than an allowance. All other potential employment zone delivery agents will have the ability to pay their participants using a variety of methods, including grants or loans. The amendment will ensure that all participants receive equal treatment, regardless of who is running their zone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rendel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 144, page 48, line 5, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2A) Regulations under this section shall require account to be taken of the degree and nature of a person's disability.".</p></blockquote>
The first thing to say about the amendment, and it possibly applies to the clause generally, is that the Government's consultation on employment zones ends on 30 April—a fortnight away. That seems to be another example of the Government paying little heed to its attempts at consultation and to the responses of interested organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear from the idea of employment zones that the Government recognise that people in different parts of the country may have different difficulties in obtaining suitable sustainable employment. Similarily people with different disabilities may have different difficulties in obtaining employment. The amendment would make the Government recognise different disabilities and take account of them in setting up the zones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>812</span>
It is a straightforward amendment, which I hope the Government want to take up. It would help them make their scheme more effective if they were sensitive to the different needs of claimant groups. The Government recognised the different approaches needed for people with disabilities by setting up a special new deal for disabled people. That shows that the Government recognise the point that I am trying to make. Even though that specially tailored scheme has helped only 50 people into work so far, the principle is there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With that special new deal, the Government have recognised the need to treat people with disabilities in different ways. I hope that they will extend that understanding of the needs of disabled people to employment zones, so that those people are treated fairly under the employment zone scheme. It is important that the personal job accounts that the Government are trying to set up are accompanied by relevant advice and support for people with disabilities. The amendment would give the Government an opportunity to do that, which I hope they will accept.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with the sentiments behind the amendment. Of course we want employment zones and our other employment programmes to be delivered in a way that is sensitive to the needs of disabled people and which enables them to make the most of their potential. However, it would be inappropriate for that to be required under primary legislation. As part of the employment zone proposals, we shall ensure that personal action plans are drawn up for and with participants. When participants have particular special needs, such as disability, those needs will be recognised sensitively in the plans, and appropriate training and other support will be available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we have said on sufficient occasions in Committee how strong is our commitment to enabling disabled people to make the most of their potential. The hon. Member for Newbury will recognise that I am giving a straightforward assurance. In regulations and in the detail of the contracts with those dealing with employment zones, we shall set out the factors that we would expect to be taken into account in the drawing up of personal action plans and in the provision of appropriate support and training programmes. Those factors will include arrangements for assisting disabled people. Moreover, we shall be monitoring arrangements on a regular basis. I hope that those assurances provide the substance of what the hon. Gentleman asked for, and that he will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rendel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted with those assurances so far as they go. It is good to have them on the record. However, this is another occasion on which an amendment fits in with the Government's wishes. I do not see why it should not be on the face of the Bill. The Government do not seem to have produced any arguments as to why it should not be, beyond saying that it is to happen anyway. If that is to be the case, the amendment might as well be accepted and we shall therefore press it to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>6.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 265, in page 54, line 23, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'() the use by a person within subsection (2) of social security information held 'by that person,'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take Government amendments Nos. 266 to 280.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be helpful if I first explain that, as drafted in the Bill, the power contained in clause 60 will support the Bill's employment measures by enabling cross-Government working to deliver the single gateway and employment zones. Regulations made under the clause will also ensure that information can be used to the best effect in operating the new deal for partners of unemployed people, for disabled people for lone parents and the new personal capability assessement. I shall not detain the Committee by setting out in detail how information will be passed in all circumstances, but it might be helpful if I provide an example by explaining how the clause will underpin the operation of the single gateway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause will allow staff from any organisation administering the single gateway to use and disclose information relating to claims for all benefits involved in the single gateway. That is an essential component of our plans for a more streamlined service that provides claimants with a single point of contact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we want a more integrated service—as I am sure all Committee members do—we must have a more integrated information system, which enables data sharing, with proper protections in terms of access authorisation, the Data Protection Acts and so on. Under existing legislative requirements, that is not possible.
	<span class='label label-info column'>814</span>
Currently, with regard to the single gateway, a local authority employee—a personal adviser, for example—cannot access the labour market system that is operated by the Employment Service. We need the provision for that reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Income support and housing benefit are similar in structure and most of the information that is required for one is required for the other. However, claimants are required to provide much of that information twice—to the Benefits Agency and again to the local authority. That is administratively time-consuming and does not offer the claimant an efficient service. Our aim is to capture the relevant information once and then to ensure that it is passed to the relevant agency to calculate entitlement to the benefits which the person wishes to claim and to which he is entitled. That will also enable the gathering and passing on of information about a claimant's employability, which is an essential element of the single gateway. For example, information on employability gathered at the registration and orientation stage by someone from one organisation will need to be passed on to the personal adviser for discussion at the work-focused interview. The personal adviser is likely to be from another agency, so the provision is necessary to enable the information to be passed on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are conscious of the need for safeguards. Information may be supplied or used only for the purposes defined. The effect of the clause is limited by subsections (3) and (4) and the use and disclosure of information under the clause is limited to people in the categories set out in subsection (2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments narrow the clause and tighten the circumstances in which social security information may be made available. Amendment No. 277 removes subsection (6), which was widely drawn and might have attracted understandable criticism from hon. Members either now or at later stages of the Bill. The amendments tighten the provision to provide additional safeguards and to ensure that the clause provides for the sharing of information relating to the employment aspects of the single gateway and other work-related schemes, such as the new deals, between all the agencies administering the system, but without going wider than necessary to achieve those goals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oaten</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. The measure seems to he sensible and is an example of joined-up government—that is an awful phrase—but I wondered about the cost implications. With so many different agencies involved, which agency will have lead responsibility to ensure co-ordination between agencies? Will other agencies, such as local authorities and the Child Support Agency, be reimbursed for the cost of bringing their computers and data up to speed so that the seamless join that we all want takes place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman sees the good sense in the provisions. They are a step towards not joined-up government, but integrated government and service delivery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Gentleman also recognises that in the medium term money will be saved. If information is collected only once and then transmitted electronically instead of being collected twice and saved on different
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0916">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>815</span>
data systems, that must save money. Some up-front investment will be required to enable the scheme to work effectively and for the pilot schemes that will start in June and November. We are setting about the matter in two stages. First, we are pulling together the existing information systems and, secondly, we shall undertake the more ambitious work of integrating them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The extra resources being made available for the single gateway pilot schemes total £79 million. That will cover everything, not just additional information technology requirements. The detailed budgeting is being worked out and will be made available in due course. In the medium term, resources will be saved and a better standard of service will be provided. More work will be undertaken because of the number of people who will be interviewed, but who are not interviewed under the present system. That will have implications for the overall resourcing for a national roll-out of the single work-focused gateway. Information-sharing must provide efficiencies as well as a more effective, user-friendly and convenient service to claimants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 265 to 269 and 274 to 277 allow subsection (6), to which I referred, to be left out. As I said, it provided wider powers than we now believe are needed. Amendments Nos. 270, 271 and 272 simplify the clause, as we have concluded that it is not necessary to prescribe particular services and functions within the clause. Amendment No. 280 simply provides a fuller definition of
	<br><blockquote><p>"purposes connected with employment and training",</p></blockquote>
to make the intention of the clause more clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These provisions are all about providing clients with a modern and integrated service, our aim is to help people into work more effectively. This is not a general power to share information among Government agencies, but is about breaking down artificial organisational barriers and creating a more integrated service that will better meet the needs of clients and of society as a whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is very sensible, but I have a couple of Questions for the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are examples of agencies like this working closely together, not necessarily in terms of data exchange, but certainly in terms of the exchange of information, and hotlines between local government departments and, for example, the Benefits Agency. That is very effective, and the Minister is right to say that in the medium term, it will save money. More importantly, it delivers a better service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past decade, we have seen in councils of all political persuasions the development of one-stop shops, so that people do not have to go through the process of continually relaying exactly the same information to different agencies. That is welcome. However, there are dangers, and the Minister rightly mentioned confidentiality. We need to guard against that most carefully. At one extreme, we find the selling-on of information. It is not unknown for local authorities to make money, quite properly and legitimately, by selling mailing lists to companies. We must ensure that information relating to claimants is not part of any such sale. The Minister said that it was the Government's intention to ensure that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>816</span>
Another aspect that I could not see in the provisions was a reference to the Data Protection Act 1998 and the role of the registrar, although I am slightly handicapped by having poured a glass of water over my copy of the Bill. I do not want to detain the Committee too long, but I would like an explanation about that. The hon. Member for Winchester, who is not in his place and has probably popped out to deal with some important matter, asked who would be entitled to see information at any particular time, if information is retained electronically, a person has a right under the Data Protection Act to look at and correct that information, to ensure that this information is not passed on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be grateful if the Minister would say something about data protection in terms of protecting the individual and of ensuring that claimants have access to information about themselves, and the opportunity to correct that information. If it were earlier, I would have a lot more to say on this issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That matter was largely in the hands of the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome this opportunity to reiterate and expand on the assurances that I have already given on the important Question of safeguarding confidentiality of access to sensitive data, and the controls that are appropriate. It is important for people to know that information is being properly used, and that there is not a bigger risk of its getting into the wrong hands. A number of safeguards are in operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To answer the hon. Gentleman's question: yes, where data are stored and transmitted electronically, they will be covered by the Data Protection Act. People will also have the right to see the data that are transmitted on them, in accordance with the principles contained in that Act. The Bill, and subsequent regulations, will limit the people who can authorise access to the information. There will also be audit trails, which will show who has accessed personal information. The same controls will apply to private and voluntary sector employees who work with that information. They will do so, for example, in relation to the single work-focused gateway pilots and in the call centres that will be at the registration and orientation stages' of those pilots. All of those safeguards will be in place. Section 123 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 makes it a criminal offence for employees to make an unauthorised disclosure of social security information. Our proposals involve strong safeguards, which we shall ensure are maintained in the management of the system and in the contracts that are agreed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to consider the following: Government new clause 13—	<i>Sharing of functions as regards claims and information</i>—
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government amendment No. 264.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>818</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new clause will replace clause 58, and amendment No. 264 will remove the reference to clause 58 that is currently in the commencement provisions of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 30 March, we launched our White Paper on modernising government. Our aim is to improve public services in every sphere. Public expectations are rising sharply and the public expect a better service from the Government, which we are determined to provide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause is an important step in modernising the social security system. It involves giving our customers an efficient, effective and more streamlined service—a joined-up service that works across government boundaries. In short, it is the sort of service that our clients want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The powers in the clause build on the clause 60 provisions relating to the supply and use of social security information, which we recently discussed. That clause related to information sharing on employment issues. The new clause paves the way for an integrated claims service, and will give new functions to local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our first aim is to enable local authorities to play a full part in our plans for a modern, integrated social security system. Currently, local authorities may deal with claims only for housing benefit and council tax benefit. They will be key players in the seamless customer service that we want to achieve with the single work-focused gateway. They must therefore be able to handle claims and information that relate to a wider range of social security benefits. Clause 58 aimed to do that. However, claimants should be able to access the system at any point and to transact a range of business at that point, and they should have to provide the information that is needed for all of their claims only once.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should be no doubt about our ability to make regulations that will ensure that our partners, in joint working arrangements with local authorities, the Benefits Agency and the Employment Service, can provide the same level of customer service in respect of claims for housing benefit and for council tax benef it. That is why the new clause is necessary. We believe that it is better to include all of the additional powers that are necessary to give effect to an integrated service in one clause rather than to amend existing legislation. The new powers complement rather than replace existing powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are making no changes to current responsibilities for deciding claims. The information that local authorities collect about social security benefits, war pensions or child support will be passed directly to the appropriate agency for processing. In the same way, any information collected by other agencies that relates to housing benefit or council tax benefit claims will be sent to the relevant local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The necessary safeguards will be introduced to minimise any risk of unauthorised disclosure of social security information. Regulations will set out clearly the limits of the new powers and will specify what
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0918">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>819</span>
must be done with the information collected. As hon. Members will be aware, the regulations made under the new clause must be compatible with data protection law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government aim to develop a modern, streamlined welfare service, which is better focused on the needs of the customer. I therefore hope that hon. Members will accept the new clause as a replacement for clause 58.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
