Draft Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1996 (Code of Practice) Order 1999</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move.
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1996 (Code of Practice) Order 1999.</p></blockquote>
The order was laid before the House on 8 March 1999. The background is that the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1998, which received Royal Assent on 8 April 1998, amended the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1996 to make provision for police interviews to be audio recorded and for the audio recording arrangements to be governed by a code of practice.<br><br>
Audio recording will add to the range of existing safeguards. For example, a statutory code of practice is already in place governing the detention, treatment, questioning and identification of terrorist suspects in police custody. It requires, amongst other things, continued detention of suspects to be reviewed at 12-hourly intervals; the maintenance of detailed custody records; and breaks for all normal meal times.<br><br>
It also provides for regular visits and examinations by a medical practitioner, and a right for the detained person to have a continuous period of eight hours in any period of 24 hours free from questioning, travel or interruption. Audio recording will run alongside the existing system of silent video recording. That, too, is governed by a statutory code of practice and has been mandatory since 10 March 1998.<br><br>
The posts of independent commissioner and deputy commissioner for the holding centres provide valuable assurances that the range of safeguards is being fully and properly applied. These safeguards demonstrate that the Government continue to attach the greatest importance to the protection of the rights of those held in police custody.<br><br>
The draft order before the Committee today will bring into operation a code of practice governing audio recording, which was laid in draft before this House on 23 February 1999. It was drawn up to mirror as closely as possible the equivalent Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 code of practice on tape recording of interviews with suspects.<br><br>
The draft code sets out a range of requirements that must apply when interviews with terrorist suspects are audio recorded; it also gives guidance for police officers and others on the application and interpretation of the code.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
Section 1 of the code describes to whom it applies; defines some of the terms that appear in it; and requires that it be readily available at all police offices that are designated for the detention of terrorist suspects. Section 2 is concerned with the integrity of the system and requires that a twin deck tape recorder be used, with one tape—chosen by the detained person— serving as the master tape.<br><br>
Section 3 specifies when audio recording shall apply. Section 4 deals with the interview from prior to commencement: the loading of the tape recorder, through to cautioning; dealing with objections or complaints; changing tapes; breaks in the interviewing process; and the conclusion of the interview, including the removal of the tapes from the recorder.<br><br>
Section 5 describes what happens after the interview in terms of the preparation of written records of the interview; and sections 6 and 7 deal respectively with tape security and the destruction of tapes.<br><br>
The laying of the draft code of practice followed a public consultation exercise last autumn, when all interested parties were invited to comment. Of the 70 or so individuals and bodies who received a copy of the draft code, 12 made comments. Apart from the legal agencies, these included the Standing Advisory Committee on Human Rights, the Committee on the Administration of Justice, Northern Ireland Committee, Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the independent Commission for police complaints.<br><br>
Most respondents expressed support for the move to introduce audio recording of terrorist interviews. It is a constructive measure, which will do much to build confidence in the police interviewing system. In the interests of maintaining parity with the equivalent provisions of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, only minor amendments were made to the code in light of the detailed comments received.<br><br>
Once the draft order has been approved by both Houses of Parliament and is made, the Secretary of State will make a further order. That order, which will be subject to the negative resolution procedure, will require from 24 May the audio recording of police interviews with persons detained under section 14(l)(a) and section 14(l)(b) of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989. The second order will also specify additional circumstances in which police interviews will be audio recorded in accordance with the code. I shall explain what those additional circumstances will be.<br><br>
Occasionally, a person is brought before a magistrates court after being charged with one offence, and the police need to interview him further at a holding centre about other offences. In such circumstances, the police are not required to make a section 14 PTA arrest, or a further section 14 PTA arrest, as the case may be. Instead, they will apply under article 47(4B) of the Magistrates Courts (Northern Ireland) Order 1981 to have the accused remanded into custody of a police officer for the purposes of further inquiries into other, terrorism-related offences. It is proposed that interviews that take place in those circumstances will be required to be conducted in accordance with the code.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0545">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
I am sure that the Committee will welcome the step that the Government have taken to bring the draft code of practice into operation on 24 May. Keeping it closely in line with PACE provisions is consistent with the Government's declared aim of aligning holding centre procedures with those applicable under ordinary criminal law.<br><br>
The Government have consistently taken the view that the many benefits of audio recording make the measure a worthwhile step. Audio recordings will provide the best available evidence in court proceedings. Their disclosure to the courts should reduce the length of contested trials arising from confessions. Tape recordings will provide the best available evidence to prove or disprove allegations of psychological abuse or harassment.<br><br>
I am happy to say that the Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary<i>—</i>RUC<i>—</i>fully supports the move. On his authority, the audio recording system has been operating in the holding centres since midnight on 10 January 1999. That has provided a useful opportunity to test the system. I am sure that the Committee will wish to note that, since then, the police have experienced no procedural difficulties conducting the numerous audio recorded interviews.</span></p>
<p>10.7 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Moss <span class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Cambridgeshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As we said during the passage of the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1998, we welcome the introduction of audio recording of interviews. We therefore welcome this order, which sets out the code of practice and the implementation date of 24 May.<br><br>
Why has it taken so long to establish the procedure? Reasons were given last year, and the delays may be due to the cost of equipment and training, and to the consultation process. Nevertheless, a year has passed, which seems an inordinately long time. Perhaps the Minister will tell the Committee why it has taken so long to achieve implementation. I presume that the equipment will be available in the three holding centres, and that it will be the same in each of them.<br><br>
There has been consultation, to which the Minister alluded, but has the system been monitored in trials? Are we sure that the code of practice is set out in a way that offers the RUC a workable and practical system? Is the system replicated elsewhere? Is the system—and its procedures—used on the United Kingdom mainland, elsewhere in Europe, or in the United States? Is it a bespoke system devised and brought together by the RUC and the Northern Ireland Office, albeit after consultation with outside bodies?<br><br>
If the system begins in May but, after some time, does not seem to be working as well as it should, what are the procedures for making changes to the code of practice? Are they already built into the order, will further legislation have to be introduced or can changes be made simply by the RUC in consultation with the Northern Ireland Office or the Assembly, if the latter has any influence on these matters in future?<br><br>
We welcome the introduction of audio recording. I am puzzled as to why we still have silent video recording. I accept that a separate audio recording is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
necessary, but why can there not be two sets of audio recordings, one alongside the video with the tape, so that, as people speak, the words fit their mouth movements and one can see what they said and when? That will assist the judicial process, as the Minister said. I hope that it will ensure that justice is done, that time wasting in the courts is a thing of the past and that the real criminals are brought to book as speedily as possible. We support the order wholeheartedly.</span></p>
<p>10.11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Cohen (Leyton and Wanstead)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a good code of practice and I support it, but I seek some clarification. At the end of the code of practice, section 7, headed "Tape Destruction", says:
<br><blockquote><p>"At the conclusion of criminal proceedings, or in the event of a direction not to prosecute, the contents of a working copy of the tape shall be completely erased."</p></blockquote>
It goes on:
<br><blockquote><p>"Unless the provisions of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996, Code of Practice, apply, or unless civil proceedings have been instigated or it is clear that none will be, master tapes will be destroyed six years after the date of the interview."</p></blockquote>
My concern is that miscarriage of justice cases can come to light after six years. How do the provisions of the code relate to that? If a person is found guilty on the basis of the tape evidence and the case comes up subsequently as a possible miscarriage of justice, it might be necessary to return to the original interview. Will the master tape be destroyed after six years?</span></p>
<p>10.12 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jeffrey Donaldson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Lagan Valley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The order, which my party welcomes, deals with one aspect of the emergency provisions Act—the introduction of the new code of practice for audio recording.<br><br>
There have been problems in Northern Ireland in the past with regard to confession evidence, and a number of renowned cases involve controversy over confession evidence. One thinks, for example, of the Neil Latimer case, in which his contention of innocence centres on the validity of confession evidence. I have no doubt that, had audio recording been in place at the time, the controversy surrounding that case would have been resolved. Therefore, the safeguards are important.<br><br>
It is a matter of regret that, during the past 30 years of terrorist violence in Northern Ireland and in the lifetime of the emergency provisions legislation, the judicial process has found it difficult to convict people of terrorist offences. Although we welcome the order, there is no doubt that, in terms of the conviction rate against terrorist suspects, a large number of cases remain unresolved. The measures introduced by audio recording and the accompanying code of practice are fine, but when a terrorist suspect refuses to utter a single word in an interview it is difficult to secure a conviction.<br><br>
We are dealing with a narrow issue today. While there is terrorist activity in Northern Ireland—there was yet another incident last night—the emergency provisions legislation remains relevant. We should like
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0546">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
other aspects of it to be strengthened, but we note that the chief constable supports the introduction of this code of practice. We welcome anything that makes it easier for the police to gain convictions and to have evidence that will stand up in court and help to convict terrorist suspects.</span></p>
<p>10.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank hon. Members for the welcome that they have given to the order and the process that it puts in place. I shall deal first with the points raised by the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss). He asked why it had taken so long to put that in place. The chief constable had already put the process in place on 10 January. Before that there was a consultation process, and the equipment had to be obtained. Finally, the order was brought before the Committee.<br><br>
If the chief constable had not applied the code of practice on a voluntary basis, there might have been greater urgency, but the very fact that the system was in place assured us that it was working. It also gave us a testing ground for detecting any faults in the operating process or the mechanics of the system. We shall not be able to satisfy those who wanted it from day one, but it will be in place on a mandatory basis by 24 May. That will satisfy everyone who has an interest in the matter.<br><br>
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire asked whether the equipment would be the same in all the centres. I can confirm that it will. The 1996 Act provides for the Secretary of State to revise the code of practice and sets out the procedures to be followed. A revision of the code would have to be issued for consultation, and once that process had been completed the new code would be laid before Parliament and a fresh order, similar to that before us today, would be taken through both Houses. Given the process that we have gone through and the fact that it is compatible in the main and achieves parity with the PACE provisions, the likelihood of that happening because of the change that we are introducing is not high. There have been no technical difficulties with the equipment, and the way in which the code has been applied has not been called into question. I would therefore expect these provisions to apply for a considerable time.<br><br>
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire also asked about silent video recording. That was introduced at an earlier stage, at the time of the change to the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1998, and was put in for a different purpose. Silent video recording is in a sense unique to Northern Ireland. Some use is made in Great Britain to interview children, but it is not extensively used. We have adopted that unique approach in response to allegations that there has been physical abuse of suspects. If a complaint of physical abuse was made, the tape would be made available as evidence.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
The audio recording approach is different, and is introduced in line with PACE. There could be an argument that, if audio recording had been in place in advance of silent video recording, it would have been sufficient protection and a silent video recording would be unnecessary. But the two types of recording are there for different purposes: audio recording reflects the totality of the interview, with the questions and responses throughout whereas a silent video recording is used for the purpose that I have explained.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Leyton and Wanstead (Mr. Cohen) asked why the tapes will be destroyed after six years. I am advised that the master tapes will not be destroyed; if a case were on-going, tapes would not be destroyed after six years.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Lagan Valley (Mr. Donaldson) gave a general welcome to the order. He mentioned, correctly, some of the criticisms that are made of the RUC at present and made a valuable comment on that. The police do a difficult and, in many ways, unique job, as does the RUC in the range and type of suspects that it has to interview. If those people are subsequently proved guilty, we all benefit. People should be careful about criticising the RUC in the difficult jobs that it undertakes.<br><br>
The RUC must operate with the best practices and to the best standards available. That is one reason why we are introducing the independent ombudsman, which is unique to the United Kingdom. That will give additional protection to RUC officers and to those interviewed by them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donaldson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to make it clear that I was not criticising the RUC per se. I raised one case as an example of where controversy can arise over confession evidence. We need safeguards of this kind in that process. That is why I welcome the order. I echo the Minister's words that the RUC has done an excellent job in very difficult circumstances. Given the chief constable's welcome for this additional proposal, I hope that it will strengthen the RUC's hand in exercising its difficult role.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that the hon. Gentleman was criticising the RUC; I would not think of doing so. I said that there are those who take the example of a case where there is controversy and which is proven by one set of standards and then apply it generally.<br><br>
The procedures that we are putting in place—silent video recording, audio recording and the soon-to-be-appointed independent ombudsman—will enable the RUC to operate with greater integrity. They will show in a particularly good light the way in which it has carried out its duties and responsibilities during the past couple of years as a police force, and will continue to do in the years ahead.<br><br>
On that basis, I commend the order to the Committee.</span></p>
