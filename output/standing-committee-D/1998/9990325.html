	<p>	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mrs. Barbara Roche)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Value Added Tax (Finance) Order 1999 (S.I. 1999, No. 594).</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the Value Added Tax (Buildings and Land) Order 1999 (S.I. 1999, No. 593).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that this is the first time that I have had the pleasure of being in a Committee under your chairmanship, Mr. Olner, and I look forward to the experience tremendously. I am sure that I speak for the whole Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are committed to fairness in taxation, the orders demonstrate that commitment. Order No. 593 is an anti-avoidance measure. Order No. 594 confirms that certain backroom services supplied to businesses in the finance sector should properly attract VAT.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The buildings and land order is designed to stop VAT avoidance. It amends schedule 10 to the Value Added Tax Act 1994 to strengthen an existing anti-avoidance measure introduced in March 1997 that restricts the scope of the option to tax land and buildings. Section 51(2) of that Act allows for schedule 10 to be amended by a Treasury order. The order stops a device that is used to get around the original measure, and it will protect £30 million of revenue each year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may help if I explain the background to the orders. Businesses supplying services that are exempt from VAT, such as banks, insurance companies and universities, do not add VAT to their income. In turn, however, they cannot claim back all the VAT that they incur on their own capital and overhead costs, which includes the construction of the buildings that they occupy. Some businesses have tried to get the best of both worlds by not adding VAT to their income but by entering into avoidance schemes to spread the VAT cost of their buildings over many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The method of doing that was complicated. Instead of occupying the buildings immediately, some of the businesses that I have referred to leased the property to associated companies and then took a lease back again before taking up occupation. By opting to tax the rents they were able to recover all the VAT incurred on the building, whereas without that device, very little of the tax would have been recoverable. Although they paid VAT on the rents charged by the associated company, that was spread over a considerable number of years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
The measure introduced in March 1997 was intended to counter those lease and leaseback schemes by preventing exempt businesses from opting to tax the leasing of buildings that they actually intended to occupy. In that way, businesses could not inflate their recovery of VAT on the cost of the buildings. That measure, however, was confined to buildings falling within the capital goods scheme—essentially those buildings that cost £250,000 or more to purchase, construct or refurbish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some people, still seeking to avoid tax, have found a way around that by artificially bringing forward the date of the lease to a time before the building actually existed—that is, before construction has started. At that stage, the building is not a capital item within the capital goods scheme, so the 1997 anti-avoidance measure does not apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These newer schemes have mainly been used by universities and colleges of further education, although they were capable of much wider use, and there was a real risk of others jumping on the bandwagon. Many of those using the schemes were already receiving funding from the Government, which is calculated on a gross cost basis. Tax avoidance undermines the basis of managing public expenditure, with the result that the shortfall in revenue could lead to other worthy causes being deprived of their fair share of state funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order will stop that VAT avoidance scheme. It will bring into the scope of the 1997 measure not only a building that is regarded as a capital item under the capital goods scheme, but the lease of land on which such a building will be constructed. To prevent the parties from merely transferring the development after the lease is granted but before building works have started, the measure will apply either when the building is a capital item for the person granting the lease or when it is a capital item for a person to whom the site is subsequently transferred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been a mischievous scheme, which has been marketed and taken up even though the Government's views on avoidance have been made clear and although Customs and Excise has explained time and again that such schemes are likely to be closed. I propose today to do just that. Not only will the order stop any future use of such schemes, but it will bring existing schemes to a timely halt. That will be done by treating the original lease as though it had been made on 10 March 1999, the date that the order came into force. Consequently, any rents received after 10 march 1999 in respect of an existing scheme will become exempt from VAT. The practical effect of the measure is that the VAT originally recovered will become subject to annual adjustments over 10 years under the capital goods scheme in order to reflect the true use of the building.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order merely tightens an existing anti-avoidance measure. People who tried to avoid the measure knew full well its purpose and knew about our commitment to stop tax avoidance. They should not be surprised that the schemes have been closed down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, as part of our commitment to fairness in taxation, we believe that each group or business sector should pay its fair share of tax. Recent decisions taken by the courts have meant that the share of VAT paid by the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0594">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
finance sector has been reduced. The amendments made by order No. 594 are designed to redress the balance and restore the position to what was intended before those cases and to what is required under European law. I stress that they do not introduce new taxation. They do not affect the treatment of the services that financial institutions offer consumers or businesses. The amendments affect some services bought in by financial institutions, which were always intended to be taxable and are taxable in other member states of the European Community. The changes therefore restore a level playing field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most services provided by financial institutions are exempt from VAT, but the finance sector makes its contribution by paying VAT on the goods and services that it buys in, which are generally taxable. The VAT on them is not recoverable by the institution if it is used in making exempt supplies. Recent court decisions have extended exemption to cover may such services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the finance sector, European law requires a clear distinction to be made between intermediary services, which are exempt, and financial management services, which are taxable. That distinction has been blurred by the courts. While those cases were developing, Customs and Excise undertook extensive consultation in Europe on the issues, which established that the way in which the exemption was being interpreted in the United Kingdom courts was out of step with the position elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those hon. Members who follow such matters, there has been some comment suggesting that the changes introduced by the order are contrary to European law—in particular, that credit card management services are exempt under the sixth EC VAT directive, and that the European Court of Justice has ruled to that effect. That is quite wrong. The changes have as a primary aim the proper implementation of the relevant EC directive, in accordance with the UK's treaty obligations, and reflect the consultation exercise, the relevant rulings of the European Court of Justice, and —very important—our legal advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may help the Committee if I give a few examples of the kind of services at issue. They include services provided by a motoring organisation to a bank in connection with devising and marketing an affinity credit card; clerical, administrative and management services in connection with a hire purchase operation; and, in a case currently before the courts, computer processing of credit card transactions and general management of the card operation. In none of those cases does the subcontractor provide the exempt credit. Contracting out such administrative services is no different from contracting out book-keeping, secretarial or legal services. They should all be taxable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The changes were introduced without notice by Treasury order laid on Budget day, 9 March, and coming into effect on 10 March. There is a history of the finance sector forestalling tax changes by artificial prepayment schemes, and the timing was designed to limit the opportunity for that. We received clear legal advice that it was impossible under existing EC law to provide anti-forestalling provisions in the circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
The changes restore the proper scope of exemption for services bought in by financial institutions. They do not introduce new taxation, nor do they constitute any widening of the scope of VAT. They are necessary to ensure that the finance sector continues to pay its fair share of VAT.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Heald 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Hertfordshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How much extra revenue will result?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we have shown in the Red Book, the changes wil protect revenue. It is estimated that the Value Added Tax (Finance) Order 1999 will restore about £100 million of revenue currently being lost as a result of court judgments. It is not about raising extra revenue, as the hon. Gentleman suggests, but about protecting the revenue base.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order is necessary to ensure that the finance sector continues to pay its fair share of VAT, and to ensure continued compliance with European law. It does not introduce a tax on supplies made to consumers or businesses, other than the financial service providers themselves, and will ensure that the finance sector shoulders its fair share of the tax burden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I look forward to a constructive debate and hope that at its conclusion, both orders will meet with the approval of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.43 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Whittingdale 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Maldon and East Chelmsford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I start, Mr. Olner, by joining the Minister in welcoming you to the Chair. I think that it is the first time that I have had the pleasure of serving under your chairmanship. I have no doubt that you will be firm but fair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also grateful to the Minister for her introductory remarks explaining both of the orders. We are debating two separate orders; both are somewhat technical and difficult, but they are extremely different. The first is narrowly targeted and intended to close a loophole that the previous Government first moved to attack. The second is a substantial extension of the VAT base, in direct breach of the Chancellor's assurance. Its effect is likely to be to push up the cost to banking customers, and it is highly probable that it also contravenes European law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me deal first with the Value Added Tax (Buildings and Land) Order 1999. Prior to 1997, a financial institution, such as a bank, which was VAT-exempt, could get around that by exploiting the option-to-tax rules. If a bank, say, decided to construct a new building, it could set up a subsidiary company to which it would lease the land and then construct a building on it. If the bank opted to pay VAT on the rents that it charged to the company, all VAT on construction costs would become recoverable. The subsidiary could then sub-lease the property back to the bank, at which stage VAT is payable on the rent and is not recoverable. The benefit to the bank is mainly in terms of cash flow because the VAT that is recovered on construction costs is offset by the VAT on rental payments. There is a potential substantial cash flow saving.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0595">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
In 1997, as the Minister explained, the previous Government tried to prevent such schemes by disapplying the option-to-tax rules for expenditure on a capital item that cost in excess of £250,000, where the intention was that it would be used by a partially exempt business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Burnett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Torridge and West Devon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that those expenses would not be entirely recoverable against subsequent rents? In so far as they are capital expenses, they are not recoverable and would, therefore, be a net loss to the exempt organisation, which would usually be the bank.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to summarise the matter in a reasonably succinct way, and I agree that I may have glossed over some complications. In some circumstances, what the hon. Gentleman says may be correct. I did not want to take up too much of the Committee's time with the detail of what went on in some cases. The general principle, however, which I hope that the hon. gentleman accepts, is that the scheme was intended to get around the VAT payment and to benefit cash flow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The previous Government moved to close the scheme. However, they disapplied the option-to-tax rules only where the grant of the land was made within the period that applied for the capital goods scheme. That allowed the anti-avoidance rules to be easily circumvented by ensuring that the land was leased through a subsidiary before construction began.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The buildings and land order closes that loophole by disapplying the option-to-tax rules for the entire period after the expiry of the capital goods scheme. I assume that that was the original intention in 1997, so the Opposition do not oppose the order. However, we have some concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister explained, the order comes into effect for all grants signed after 10 March 1999. However, it also deems that those signed previously will apply from that date. That means that, because of the operation of the capital goods scheme, VAT on construction costs will be clawed back by Customs and Excise over the next eight years from schemes from which it has already been recovered. In that respect, the order is retrospective. It will upset arrangements that a business entered into in all good faith in 1997.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some might say that it is not unreasonable for a financial institution that exploited the loophole in the way that I described to be prevented from getting away with it. The new rules apply, however, not just to inter-group schemes, but to third-party arrangements. A company that has calculated rental yields on the basis of capital costs may find that it has to pay back VAT as well over the next seven or eight years. That will completely upset the economics of the original transaction. In such cases, third-party arrangements will need time for renegotiation. What estimate has been made of the number of such schemes that will be affected?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measure is not confined to the financial services sector. Potentially, all those in the exempt sector may be affected, including private hospitals, universities—which
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
the Minister mentioned—sports clubs and charities. Has the Minister made any estimate of the potential cost of the measure to those institutions? Why should they have to bear that cost when they were merely taking advantage of the rules as they stood at the time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Angela Browning 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tiverton and Honiton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that it would have been extremely helpful if a compliance cost assessment had been made available to the Committee in advance of this debate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. The Minister produced a figure in her speech, but there has been no real breakdown of the sectors in which the recovery of VAT will take place. I hope that the Minister will give us a little more detail about the costs and who will have to bear them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the Value Added Tax (Finance) Order. It is not a narrow measure, nor does it close a loophole. It represents a major extension of the VAT base. That may come as something of a surprise to Opposition Members, because they will recall the Chancellor saying in his Budget speech:
	<br><blockquote><p>"On VAT, today I propose there will be no increase in rates and no extension of VAT." —[	<i>Official Report,</i> 9 March 1999; Vol. 327, c. 186.]</p></blockquote>
If I remember correctly, Labour Members all waved their Order Papers at that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are used to the Chancellor failing to mention tax rises in his Budget speech—they become apparent only when one examines the Red Book. This is actually worse. The Chancellor said one thing in his speech, but the truth is exactly the opposite. This measure is a major extension of VAT which, according to the Red Book and according to the Minister a few moments ago, will bring in an extra £100 million a year. The Government said—and the Minister repeated it this afternoon—that the change merely restores the position prior to recent legal challenges, but that is not true either.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under paragraph 13(b)(d) of the sixth directive, financial services institutions are generally exempt from charging VAT. That is translated into UK law by schedule 9 of the Value Added Tax Act 1994, under which the exempt categories are spelled out in group 5. The fifth of those deals with the making of arrangements for any transaction covered by the first four categories, which generally cover dealings in money, securities or credit. In fact, many financial institutions have chosen to outsource certain services. In particular, those offering credit card facilities frequently use a third party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the time of the introduction of VAT in 1973 until 1995, credit card management companies were exempt from VAT. That was certainly the case for the original Joint Credit Card Company, which used to administer Access from Southend. When that company, which had by then become Signet, was acquired by FDR, it was on the understanding from Customs and Excise that it was exempt from VAT. In 1995, however, Customs and Excise arbitrarily changed its mind and declared that credit card management was no longer exempt. Since then there have been several legal challenges. Three of them—the Civil Service Motoring Association, Lloyds TSB and Continuum—all resulted in defeats for Customs and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0596">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
Excise. The hearing of the fourth case, FDR, was not concluded until January this year, but a judgment is expected imminently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There can be no doubt that the order is intended to pre-empt that judgment. It has been made with no consultation with the industry and under the cloak of Budget secrecy, for which there is no justification whatever. The Minister attempted to justify it by saying that there was a danger of forestalling, but it is extremely difficult to see how such a measure could be forestalled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is in marked contrast with the position under the previous Government, when a similar measure affecting insurance was introduced. On that occasion, a consultation document was issued which led to the publication of draft clauses. That allowed the industry to make representations and the order was improved as a result. The failure to consult in this instance flies in the face of the code of practice of Customs and Excise, which says that the Government intend to consult on tax policy matters wherever it is reasonable to do so. It sets out a number of benefits that come from consultation, but it also gives cases where consultation might not be appropriate; none of those apply in this case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have mentioned the three legal cases that Customs and Excise lost. Even more significant, however, is the judgment in the Sparekassernes Datacenter case. That was a ruling by the European Court of Justice that the services provided by Sparekassernes Datacenter fell within the exempt categories as laid down in the sixth directive. That is highly relevant, because the services provided by SDC were essentially payment transfer services. SDC acted as an outsourced data centre—essentially, a back office for a large number of small Danish savings banks. It dealt with automatic teller machine transactions and with Dankort card transactions—Dankort is the Danish credit card. The Danish Government attempted to claim that the services provided by SDC were not VAT exempt. The European Court of Justice ruled, however, that specific payment functions had been delegated to SDC and that it should therefore be exempt under the sixth directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that Customs and Excise and the Minister have attempted to argue that the SDC judgment has only limited application. To date, however, that has certainly not been the view of the tribunals, and there is good reason to believe that it will not be the view of the tribunal in the FDR case. We therefore face the real prospect that in perhaps just a few days the order will be found to be illegal under European law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is hardly surprising that the industry was astonished and aghast when it learned of the order. It had been widely understood that the FDR case would be the test decision, and its outcome would be watched throughout the industry. Suddenly, however, the Government are attempting to pre-empt that decision. My question to the Minister is, why? What does she propose to do if the tribunal rules in FDR's favour under European law, as many observers believe that it will? Will she introduce a new order to reverse the decision? I can tell her one thing that will happen: the Government will immediately find themselves faced with an application for judicial review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order is not confined to the provision and management of credit card services. It may cover call centres, sponsors of affinity cards, loan administrations,
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
fund administrations, dealing systems and many other corporate finance services. It is very unclear, however, which of those will be covered and which will not. It is hardly surprising that the British Bankers Association has said that the measure is flawed, that it will create uncertainty and that it will lead to increased litigation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that we do know is that Customs and Excise expects the measure to bring in £100 million. Will the Minister provide a breakdown of that figure, so that we have a better idea of who will be expected to charge VAT? One thing is certain: someone will have to pay, and the most likely person is the banking customer. VAT will increase the cost of credit card management and all other services affected by the 17.5 per cent. charge. Clearly, the chances are that those extra costs will be passed on and that the customer will end up paying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The alternative is that banks and other financial institutions will take such services back in-house, so that they do not have to pay VAT. If that happens, operators such as FDR will be likely to move overseas to somewhere where VAT is not charged. The Minister spoke about creating a level playing field, but the playing field is not level at all. A number of other countries in the European Union, such as Luxembourg, do not levy VAT on the services in question. It would be not in the least surprising if some British operators decided to set up in such a country. It is worth noting that FDR alone employs about 2,500 people based in Basildon, which is next door to my constituency. Those jobs and many others are being put at risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order is dishonest, because it directly contradicts Budget assurances; it is flawed, in that it is ambiguous and vague about which services it covers; it is damaging, as it raises the cost of particular financial services and threatens jobs; and there is a very strong likelihood that it is also illegal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not too late. I appeal even now to the Minister to withdraw the order and to think again. That is also the view of the British Bankers Association, which has asked for the order to be withdrawn to allow time for the industry to sit down with Customs and Excise and redraft it. At the very least, we should wait for the tribunal judgment to see whether it is in accordance with European law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister refuses to listen, the Opposition will have no alternative but press the orders to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to join the Minister and the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale) in welcoming you, Mr. Olner, to the Chair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the Value Added Tax (Buildings and Land) Order, I should state the liberal Democrats' support for anti-avoidance legislation. Such legislation should, however, be fair, and it should not catch innocent transactions. It should also be accurate and effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members who debated last year's Finance Bill remember the Government's trumpetings about the effectiveness of their anti-avoidance provisions. We saw the immense errors made in the stamp duty reserve tax anti-avoidance provisions, which as a result of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0597">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
incompetence, have cost the Exchequer more than £1,000 million. That resulted, I believe, from just two deals—the BP-Amoco deal and the Vodaphone deal. If we are to have anti-avoidance provisions, will Ministers please ensure that they are effective and fair?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Freehold land and leasehold property of more than 21 years' duration are invariably presumed exempt from VAT, so VAT is not payable on the supply of a property—on the transfer of a property or on rent. That is not always a benefit, because a landowner or lessor cannot recover VAT on costs. Costs or fees for architects, planners and lawyers will be even higher when brown-field land rather than green-field land is developed. A land owner can elect to waive the exemption to VAT and bring property into charge for value added taxation. The land owner therefore has to charge VAT on subsequent sale proceeds or rents and can recover VAT on his inputs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not too bad if the purchaser or lessee is registered for VAT because the VAT can be recovered on the price of freehold land or the VAT on the rent. It would not suit a bank or insurance company, which are exempt, because, omitting a complication of partial exemption, any VATable supply to a bank or insurance company is not recoverable by the exempt organisation. There is an in-built cost on the transaction of about 17.5 per cent.—the rate of VAT.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Order No. 593 is overly complex and its rules impact on entirely innocent transactions. A great onus of inquiry is being put on vendors and lessors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall return to that, but perhaps I may refer the Minister to coincidental funding. If a bank funds the construction of a new shopping centre and decides to take one of its units as a branch, will that transaction be caught by the order? Will the option to tax not apply to the letting to the bank and, thus, the rents payable to the exempt company?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My next point is on funding. If a developer borrows to undertake development and grants a lease to, say, an insurance company—an exempt organisation—and uses the premium on the lease to repay the debt, wholly or in part, will the option to tax be disapplied so that the developer cannot recover VAT on its development costs?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister and other members of the Committee are aware of my next point, which, again, relates to funding. If a developer undertakes fitting-out works for the tenant, which the tenant pays for separately, is that in fact funding, and will the option to tax be disapplied?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, the option is disapplied if the intended use is not wholly or mainly for eligible—that is, taxable—purposes. Wholly or mainly is usually arbitrarily interpreted as an 80 per cent. test. As a matter of fact, I am sure that the Minister will agree that as far as "mainly" is concerned, anything over 50 per cent. complies. This definition adds the word "wholly." I should like the Minister to tell the Committee whether the 80 per cent. rule is intended to apply, or a slightly lower percentage. Will the Minister also elaborate upon new paragraph (2) (3AAA)
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
and the meaning of the word "transferred"? Does that cover the grant of a lease or does it cover only an outright transfer of a freehold?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Vendors and landlords will have to have significant information about their purchasers and tenants. If they were in the capital goods scheme, and potentially caught by the disapplication, the 1997 rules require vendors and lessors to know the intended use—for example, by reference to the unlegislated 80 per cent. test to which I referred. The new rules mean that even if they are not in the capital goods scheme, if the purchaser or tenant undertakes work—maybe just fitting-out work—which will put the building into the capital goods scheme, will that be caught? The test is not about the vendor or lessor's intentions, but about the intention of the person responsible for financing. I look forward to the Minister's comments on those points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the Value Added Tax (Finance) order No. 594. It may help the Committee if I go back to basics on value added tax, which is supposed to be fairly simple. The best rate, strangely enough, is to be zero-rated on one's supplies. One does not have to charge VAT, but one can reclaim it. Businesses that are standard-rated—that is, most manufacturing businesses and many service industries, but not banks and insurance companies, to which I shall refer later—charge VAT, currently at 17.5 per cent ., on what they supply or make, which is their outputs. However, they can recover the VAT on what they purchase. For example, a spanner factory pays VAT on the steel that it buys, and can recover it, and when it sells its spanners it charges VAT on what it sells, and accounts for the difference to Customs and Excise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a third main category for VAT, which is the exempt category into which fall banks and insurance companies, among others. It sounds very good being exempt, but I am afraid that it is not as good as it sounds. One cannot charge VAT to one's customers and when one pays for one's supplies one cannot recover it. I shall not confuse the issue too much by talking about partial exemption, but that means, roughly speaking, where a supplier makes standard-rated and exempt supplies and in those circumstances there can be some recovery of input tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is much to criticise in order No. 594 as it impacts on the management, processing and clearing, including settlement, of payment card transactions and others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether the Minister has any idea of the VATable turnover of this industry now. I understand that it is something like £500 million a year. It excludes Barclaycard, but I shall come back to Barclaycard in a while. That company is a vertically integrated business, which means that it falls within Barclays Bank plc and its services are VAT exempt notwithstanding the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should add for the Minister's benefit that the companies that make these currently exempt transactions that will fall foul of the order, such as FDR, have very little partial exemption recovery and, if the statutory instrument becomes law, they will have very little benefit indeed from the recovery of input tax. So, effectively, it is a one-way ticket that hikes up the cost by 17.5 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not dealing here with tax avoidance, these companies have been exempt for VAT purposes since the inception of value added tax in 1972. The problem now
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0598">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
is that the Government are seeking to bring them into the VAT net, which will add 17.5 per cent. to their costs. The companies are currently exempt from VAT and deal exclusively with banks, which are also exempt from VAT and cannot recover VAT on supplies made to them. It is rather like the Government saying to members of the Committee, "You have a very valuable researcher to whom you pay £20,000 a year. From tomorrow, that goes up to £23,500 a year—an increase of £3,500 a year."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in the long run the Government will not be any better off, as the hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford said. These activities will be brought in-house, like Barclaycard, and there will be redundancies and even less competition. I shall outline a number of aspects, but I hope that members of the Committee will bear it in mind that the order is likely to bring about significant redundancies and less competition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other grounds for criticising the Government on account of the order. It is as though Ministers are almost being bounced into some of this stuff by precipitate, ill-judged and ill-considered advice without having thought the orders through. There has been a complete lack of consultation, as evidenced by letters that I have received from the British Bankers Association and leading accountants Erns and Young. Incidentally, the latter firm acts for FDR, completely contrary to Customs and Excise policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Maiden and East Chelmsford—and possibly the Minster—said, FDR appealed to the VAT tribunal. I understand that the appeal was heard in January 1998 and that the appeal decision is imminent—and likely to be given within a month. The appeal was rightly founded almost entirely on European law and the sixth directive. It is highly questionable whether the order can actually change the law, because the law in this matter stems from the sixth directive and European law supervenes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the Committee's attention to the Sparkasennes Datacenter case, which is a European Court of Justice case. In it, the European Court made it quite clear that outsourced financial services remain exempt from value added tax. If there is a conflict of laws between the United Kingdom and Europe in this matter, European law prevails. The Minister must concede that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the work done by FDR is not entirely credit work. I believe that about 30 per cent of it is cash transfer work—for example., Switch and other card charge transactions. Therefore, it cannot be said that it is wholly management of credit. The sixth directive says that it is VATable if the credit is managed by a person other than a person who gives the credit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I hope that the Minister will withdraw the order and do what has been requested by numerous members of the industry and by us—consult, reconsider, think again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to serve on a Committee under your chairmanship again, Mr. Olner. I want to cover in a little more detail one or two points mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford,
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
because, in moving the order, the Minister should be aware of the concerns that exist. I shall begin with consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The words "justice" and "fairness" permeate the Government's sentences—indeed, the Minister used them this afternoon. It is part of the Government's stock in trade. However, I want to quote a short passage from a letter that I received from the British Bankers Association about its reaction to a decision that came into effect immediately after the Budget, although many of us were unaware until we read the small print that it formed part of the Budget. Although a statutory instrument was already available to the Minister, it was not made available to those who had to implement the legislation. In its letter to Her Majesty's Customs and Excise the British Bankers Association says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"instant introduction of the new rule has left banks in an impossible situation—made even more difficult by Customs' refusal to make available the statutory instrument, even though it had been laid before Parliament. This practice contrasts unfavourably with our experience with the Inland Revenue. Our members were astounded that they were expected to comply with law which they were not permitted to read."</p></blockquote>
By anybody's standards, and however insistently the Minister makes the case that she wants to pre-empt any action by the industry, I should have thought that, simply on the basis of natural fairness and justice, the Minister should investigate why the documentation was not available to those who have to apply her Government's legislation. If she cannot give me an answer today, I hope that she will undertake to look into it and write to me at a later date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also want to press the Minister on the issue raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford in some detail. I shall not repeat his points about the FDR tribunal appeal, of which we are awaiting the results. The Minister was quick to say that she had taken legal advice on this matter, but if the statutory instrument is passed today there will be legal challenge on the Government for all the reasons given by my hon. Friend, not least because it was seen to be a test case and we know that several other cases are lined up behind the FDR case, awaiting the tribunal result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will be well aware of the timing of the statutory instrument. It can only be a short time before the tribunal makes its decision public. Is she pressing the statutory instrument today because her Department has prior knowledge of the tribunal's findings? The Minister is shaking her head. I hope that she will put it on record that she has not. That was what I was led to believe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that she has taken legal advice about the Treasury's legal position in bringing the order before the Committee. She knows, as I do, that in any proposed legislation it is incumbent on Ministers to ensure that they do not incur an unnecessary charge on the public purse by allowing the introduction of a Bill that would almost certainly be challenged legally and where the advice is that Government are unlikely to win the case. Ministers have a personal duty to ensure that they do not preside over measures that result in undue legal costs being charged to taxpayers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0599">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
The Minster said that she took legal advice. Did she consult law officers or did she receive legal advice from the Treasury? That is pertinent, given the complexity of this case. In such cases, one would expect to ask law officers for advice, not simply rely on internal legal advice from a Government department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will provide specific answers to the points that I have raised. She seems to be in an undue hurry to pre-empt a tribunal result that she does not know in advance, but which might then subject businesses to a further unsettling period in which they do not know what will happen, as there will be further legal challenges to Customs and Excise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Should the Minister be unable to provide answers, will she write to us? We will not leave the matter when the Committee Room door closes this afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.21 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not intend to speak. However, the SDC case seems to have been decided on the basis that SDC was acting as an outsourced data centre providing clearings operations and payment transfers for Danish savings banks, including the processing and management of a credit card, the Dankort card, and automatic teller machine transactions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Court of Justice said that those services fall within the terms of article 13(B)(d)(3), which covers transactions including negotiation concerning deposit and current accounts, payment transfers, debts, cheques and other negotiable instruments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How does the Minister square that with the order, article 6 of which defines management of credit—which appears in a different article of the sixth directive—so as to cover the activities undertaken by SDC? For example, article 6 includes authorisation services. How can a centre process credit card transactions and not be involved in the payments to be made, which are an essential part of the processing function for a credit card?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Article 6 also includes in credit management:</p>
	<br><blockquote><p>	<ol>	<li>"(d) taking decisions relating to a grant or an application for a grant of credit;</li>
	<li>(e) creating and maintaining records relating to a grant or an application for a grant of credit one behalf of the credit provider; and</li>
	<li>(f) monitoring a creditor's payment record or dealing with overdue payments"?</li></ol></p></blockquote>
	<p>A payment centre undertakes those clearing works in addition to the processing of payment transfer. Is the Minister saying that there is some argument which justifies her imposing such duties on processing centres in Britain and which allows the European Court not to have such duties imposed on processing centres in Denmark? If so, we have failed to penetrate that argument.</p>
	<p>If the Minister is going to be up against European law and if the order is found to be fatally flawed and ultra vires, thus resulting in legal action, would not it be better to pull stumps now and do something that is legal?</p>
	<p>5.24 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an interesting debate. We heard a lot of sound, fury and froth from the hon. Members for Maldon and East Chelmsford, for
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald) and for Tiverton and Honiton (Mrs. Browning). I shall start by dealing with some of the specific points that have been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked whether the buildings and land order was retrospective, and concern was expressed about its effect on third parties. The order is not retrospective; it ensures that such avoidance schemes cannot be put in place in future. It removes the option to tax from avoidance schemes that are up and running, but only from 10 March 1999—the date that the order came into effect. Past transactions remain undisturbed, and the input tax already recovered by the tax avoider will remain in the bank account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was suggested that innocents would be hit by the order, but everyone involved knew what the situation was; the order merely impacts on artificial avoidance schemes. I was also asked about the potential cost to those taking up the schemes of closing down the schemes. I repeat that, from 1997, those taking up the schemes knew full well the risks that were involved and were left in no doubt that the schemes would be closed down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Chelmsford and Maldon East—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked how many charities might be affected. Universities and colleges have been the main users of the scheme, but, as I said earlier, the Government treat all business sectors fairly. Tax avoidance is tax avoidance, whoever perpetrates it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many specific questions were asked. I was asked what "transferred" means. It is freehold and leasehold transfer. I was also asked what wholly or mainly eligible means, and about the 80 per cent. rule. The 80 per cent. rule is a rule of thumb, used elsewhere in legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I raised the transfer question and asked about the 80 per cent. rule. Will parties in future transactions be able to rely on the 80 per cent. test?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a case of reliance; it is a rule of thumb to give an indication to the parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was also said that anti-avoidance measures should be fair and effective. I certainly agree with that, but a balance must be achieved between fairness and effectiveness, which is what the Government seek through the order. I was asked whether the measure would apply if a bank funds a shopping centre and takes out a unit. It will not, provided there is no link between the funding and the taking of the unit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So if the bank funds the transaction and takes a lease of part of the property that it funds, it will fall foul of the rules. Is that correct?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asked a specific question and I gave a specific answer. I do not want to give detailed replies to hypothetical questions. He also
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0600">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
asked whether the anti-avoidance measures require landlords to make exhaustive checks. I understand his position on the matter and reassure him that the measure is designed to hit tax avoiders. It will not affect the legitimate business activities of ordinary property developers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several questions were asked about the other order. We were asked about the current case against Customs and Excise—the case of FDR, which has been mentioned. The Government and Opposition interpretations of that case are clearly different. We are confident that the tribunal will not make a decision purely on that basis. I was asked what would happen if the tribunal finds against the Customs and Excise under European law; As the decision will be based on UK law prior to 10 March, the courts should have the opportunity to hear cases based on the amended legislation. The only court that has the authority to decide that the UK contravenes European law is the European Court of Justice. We believe that the order fully implements the only European Court of Justice judgment on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Whittingdale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I point out to the Minister that the tribunals have on three occasions found against Customs and Excise. The Minister says that she is confident that it will win on this occasion. Would it not be more sensible just to wait until the tribunal makes its ruling and we know one way or the other?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A steady line of cases have interpreted the law in a way that we feel is contrary to the practice that has occurred and which is certainly contrary to the interpretation made by other member states. It is vital that we have certainty on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the European case of SDC, it was found that SDC's activities came within article 13(B)(d)(3). What is the difference between the activities undertaken by SDC in Denmark and the activities of FDR undertaken in the UK?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is a little precipitate; I shall deal with those points later. All that I shall say now is that his interpretation of that case is different from mine. Opposition Members and my hon. Friend the Member for Nuneaton asked why there was no consultation. I said in my introductory remarks that because of the history of forestalling in the sector, it was necessary to introduce the order with immediate effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even if one accepts that, can the Minister explain why, after the Chancellor had sat down from his Budget speech and Customs and Excise decided to implement the law, the people who were being asked to apply it did not have access to a copy of the statutory instrument—indeed, were denied a copy of it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note what the hon. Lady says. She asked me to investigate the matter and I will do so. Having been a Minister herself—although not at the Treasury—she will be familiar with all the Treasury press notices that are immediately available to the public and to industry after Budgets. All the changes were made very clear. She raised
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
a specific question and I undertake to write to her on it; I shall copy the letter to other Committee members. She also mentioned the lack of consultation. That is because of forestalling. The financial sector could forestall by prepaying for a number of years. It is ideally placed to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford says that he considers the scope of VAT to be contrary to the Budget speech. I have been moderate in my remarks, but it is outrageous for Conservative Members to attack us on that when they broke their promises on taxation and VAT. The changes merely restore the position prior to recent changes.

Conservative Members asked what services were to be covered. Committee members will see from the order that the former exemption of making arrangements is replaced by an exemption for intermediary services in relation to a specific exempt financial transaction. The exemption for
	<br><blockquote><p>"The issue, transfer or receipt of, or any dealing with, money, any security for money or any note or order for the payment of money"</p></blockquote>
now specifically excludes preparatory services. That is intended to exclude data preparation services preparatory to a money or credit transfer if a supplier stops short of transferring funds. Credit management services are specifically excluded from exemption.

Other questions were asked about forestalling. We should have liked to consult the industry, but we felt that the risk to the Revenue was too great. The position of Customs and excise and the Government could have left the industry in no doubt about our attitude.

There has been a great deal of discussion about the European Court's judgment on the Danish case. We believe that Opposition Members have misread the judgment. The court adopted the position that was submitted by the United Kingdom that a subcontracted credit transfer service can be exempt only if the subcontractor effects the transfer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The undertaking of the transfer is obviously the principal activity, but what about the other activities that have to take place at the same time, including the authorisation of the payment, the clearing activities and the records? It is part and parcel of the same work. SDC, which was exempt under European law, undertook those activities and FDR undertakes them. What is the difference?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman and I have the misfortune—or the fortune—to be lawyers, and our interpretations of the judgment differ. I believe that it supports our position. The widespread consultation, which examined the situation in other European states, reinforced our view on that.

The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon asked whether VATable turnover would be hit. That has been subject to VAT and was subject to VAT under the previous Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The object of the order is to impose value added tax on suppliers for management, processing and clearing payments.

I am grateful to the Minister for saying that she will write to members of the Committee on the matter raised by the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton. Will she also write to the Committee on another, technical point? The sixth directive states that the management of credit is VATable if it is management by a person other than the person who gives the credit. I believe that Customs and Excise is arguing that companies, such as FDR, are managing credit, but how can they be managing credit if a substantial slice of the transactions does not involve credit, but is dealt with by Switch or charge cards? That is important. I do not expect an answer now, but I should very much like to hear from the Minister in writing how she reconciles those points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Roche</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly write to the hon. Gentleman on that point, which is, as he said, important and technical.

Comment was also made about whether the changes will cause distortion. The industry says that VAT is not a determining factor in outsourcing decisions and that many other factors come into play.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton asked about advice. We have not received advice from the Law Officers, but we have, as she would expect, received advice from leading counsel.

Conservative Members tried to portray us as doing something unusual in introducing the changes without notice. Something odd is happening to the Opposition. They seem to be suffering from collective loss of memory of what happened over the past 18 years. I remind them that, not so long ago in November 1996, the last Budget of the previous Administration included four significant changes to the VAT system that were effective from Budget day. They also made VAT changes after court cases. Let us have no pretence from Conservative Members that what we are doing is unusual. They were part and parcel of the procedure, yet they come to this Committee and try to pretend otherwise.

The first order deals with tax avoidance and is an anti-avoidance measure. The other order does no more than safeguard the position when businesses have sought and temporally succeeded in extending the exemption. It is consistent with the EC directive and the views of the fiscal authorities of other member states and the Commission. We believe that it is consistent with the only decision on the subject by the European Court of Justice.
