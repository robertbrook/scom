<p><i>Amendment proposed</i> [2 February]: No. 1, in page 1, line 7, leave out first 'tax'.—[<i>Mr. Pickles.</i>]</p>
<p>9 am</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments: No. 2, in page 1, line 7, leave out second 'tax'.<br><br>
No. 4, in clause 2, page 1, line 10, leave out 'tax'.<br><br>
No. 5, in clause 2, page 1, line 11, leave out 'tax'.<br><br>
No. 11, in schedule 1, page 10, line 6, leave out 'tax'.<br><br>
No. 12, in schedule 1, page 10, line 8, leave out 'tax'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eric Pickles <span class='memberconstituency'>(Brentwood and Ongar)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Roe. I want to raise a matter of which I gave you and Mrs. Dunwoody notice last night. At roughly 10 o'clock last night, we were given the two promised items—the impact assessments. I refer you to our proceedings on Tuesday, in particular to column 22. We repeatedly asked when the impact assessments would be delivered and we were given to understand that we would get them in ample time.<br><br>
Mrs. Roe, you are here to represent the Speaker, who represents Back Benchers. It is wholly unreasonable to deliberate with this lack of information. Had the old rules been in operation, the impact assessments would have been delivered a little after midnight. We are expected to debate important legislation and to make decisions that will affect people's rights without adequate knowledge of the issues. I believe that we should adjourn to allow members to consider properly these two vital reports before we amend the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman's point of order, but it is not a matter for the Chair. There is nothing to prevent us from proceeding with the debate. I am sure, however, that the Paymaster General has listened carefully to his comments and has taken note of them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mrs. Roe. The draft regulatory impact assessment has been published and it is pertinent to clause 5. We said that we would publish it in time for proper consideration. That has been done. We are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 44</span>
debating clause 1. Members will want to study the impact assessment closely because they rightly have a great interest in what it contains.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mrs. Roe. Do I take it that the Government are undertaking to publish draft regulations at least three clauses ahead of debate? A number of our amendments that are attached to clauses 1 and 2 are affected by the impact assessments. The Paymaster General's suggestion that we have plenty of time is a bit thin. It might have been more helpful had she read the amendment before making that statement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mrs. Roe. The regulations have been published. Clause 1 is a short clause that is pertinent to the Bill's main provisions. Committee members have the document in front of them, as we said they would, before we debate clause 5. If intense debate is to take place on clause 5, we may reach it a little quicker by making some progress.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is always an opportunity to table amendments on Report. We have covered this point thoroughly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Julian Brazier <span class='memberconstituency'>(Canterbury)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Roe.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have dealt with the point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a different point of order, Mrs. Roe. In the Essex local paper, the <i>Evening Echo,</i> last Thursday an advertisement for Marks and Spencer caused me to believe that privileged information, which has yet to reach the Committee, may have been given to commercial companies. The advertisement appears to give details of child care costs—information that we have been requesting for some time—which suggests that families who earn up to £30,000 a year may be eligible for child care payments under the working families tax credit.<br><br>
We have been pressing for that information since the beginning of the Committee's proceedings, Mrs. Roe. I should be grateful for your ruling on whether the Committee can proceed if commercial organisations are being told more than we are about the regulations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That would be a matter for Madam Speaker.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nick Gibb <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On Tuesday, in arguing for the amendment, I raised the fact that the Government are always trumpeting the minimum income of £10,000. On Second Reading, the Paymaster General said that the Bill
<br><blockquote><p>"will give families with children a guaranteed minimum income of £10,000 a year—£190 a week."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 26 January 1999; Vol. 324, c. <i>150.</i>]</p></blockquote>
That is not accurate, because that guaranteed minimum income applies only if the recipient is working full time. Indeed, elsewhere in her statement, the Paymaster General refers to the fact that a minimum income of £10,000 is guaranteed to families in full-time work.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0384">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 45</span>
The press release makes the matter clear. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The new Working Families Tax Credit (WFTC) will guarantee the lowest paid families a full-time income of around £10,000 a year".</p></blockquote>
When the Government trumpet their mantras, it is important that they do so accurately. The mantras are carefully crafted to say one thing but convey another. Ministers must repeat them in their entirety, so that the public are not misled, whether deliberately or inadvertently, by the skipping over of particular key phrases.<br><br>
We asked for the £10,000 figure to be recalculated. It became clear that, to achieve £190 a week, a recipient must work at least 34 hours a week. Out of the current total of 782,000 recipients of family credit, only 402,000 work full time. On the same basis, family credit would generate an income of £187.19, compared with the £190 that the working families tax credit will generate. That is a mere £3 a week more under the new regime, which will be more than eaten up by the array of stealth taxes that the Government have imposed on all income levels since taking office.<br><br>
As I said on Tuesday, in terms of the amount of cash received, the working families tax credit differs from family credit in minute ways only. That is particularly true for those on very low incomes—the very group that the Government claim the measure will assist.<br><br>
In essence, the amendment seeks to delete the word, "tax" from the phrase, "tax credit" to show that, in terms of the level of benefit that it will provide to those on low incomes, the current regime is similar to family credit. The working families tax credit's unique selling point is that it pays through the pay packet, which supposedly signifies that it is a tax credit rather than a benefit. The raison d'être behind such a payment method is that it is meant to reduce stigma. On Second Reading of the Tax Credits (Initial Expenditure) Bill, The Paymaster General said that
<br><blockquote><p>"As a tax credit rather than a welfare benefit, it should also reduce any stigma associated with claiming in-work support. We believe that that will encourage higher take-up."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 7 May 1998; Vol. 311, c. <i>874.]</i></p></blockquote>
For the benefit of those who were not ploughing through the draft regulatory impact assessment and accompanying regulations during the early hours of this morning, paragraph 10 of the assessment states that,
<br><blockquote><p>"as a tax credit rather than a welfare benefit,"</p></blockquote>
the working families tax credit will
<br><blockquote><p>"reduce the stigma associated with claiming in-work support, and so help encourage higher take-up."</p></blockquote>
Despite our pressing Ministers continually, we have yet to hear precisely what take-up rate the Government expect from the new working families tax credit. We know that family credit has a take-up rate of 72 per cent. by case load and 84 per cent. by expenditure. It will be helpful if the Paymaster General can tell us exactly what the take-up rate will be. Unless she can show that it will be higher than under family credit, how will the working families tax credit reduce stigma?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 46</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Steve Webb <span class='memberconstituency'>(Northavon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, I have a great deal of sympathy with the points that he makes. The only reason that I can think of for not supporting his amendment is that, if the new benefit is described as a tax credit, it might be more readily accepted by claimants, even though it is only spin. For that reason I hesitate to support the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising that valid point. The Government's claim is based on the belief that, simply by packaging this benefit as a tax credit, stigma will be reduced. Let us look at the evidence for that.<br><br>
Martin Taylor, the architect of the new benefit, said in evidence to the Social Security Committee:
<br><blockquote><p>"As far as I am concerned, it does not matter whether the body which determines whether or not you are entitled to the WFTC is situated in the DSS or in the Inland Revenue. I do not really think it matters where it is. As far as the stigma goes, the hard and fast evidence in all these non-financial and psychological matters is difficult to come by."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, the man who devised the system admitted that there are no surveys with empirical evidence to suggest that merely putting the claim into the Inland Revenue rather than the Benefits Agency will have an effect on stigma.<br><br>
Then we hear from Richard Baron, who works for the Institute of Directors. In his evidence to the Social Security Committee he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I do not think there will be any perceived reduction in the stigma at the point of claim because claimants will still have to claim. They will still have to fill in a form which will go to the Inland Revenue rather than the Benefits Agencythe claim and the claim form are still going to be there."</p></blockquote>
Indeed, Mr. Knox from the Federation of Small Businesses, who gave evidence with Richard Baron, said:
<br><blockquote><p>"In fact, there could be the added stigma of being an employee who receives, and knowingly receives, benefit within the workplace."</p></blockquote>
There we have it: the people who have looked into this matter most thoroughly believe that there is no reduced stigma from an earned income tax credit or working families tax credit.<br><br>
One of the great hopes when the scheme was devised was that it would be paid through the PAYE tax code. It could be argued that, had it been paid through the code, that might have reduced stigma because there would be nothing on the face of it one way or the other. However, as we know, the Revenue cannot pay those benefits through the code, because when it experimented with an N code, after several payment periods a distortion appeared in the amount of money that the tables were telling the employer to pay the employee, which was unacceptable.<br><br>
The Confederation of British Industry has similar concerns about stigma. It says that employees should not have to receive the credit through the pay packet if they do not want to. Therefore, single parents—not just couples—should have the choice of receiving the working families tax credit as a benefit. Otherwise, the payment of credit through the wage packet could increase rather than reduce perceptions of stigma.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 47</span>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Dari Taylor <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stockton, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman respond to a number of clear problems about family credit? The first relates to the slow take-up of family credit over a number of years. The advertisements came out again and again, pushing and persuading, but the take-up was very slow.<br><br>
Secondly, will the hon. Gentleman respond to the fact that it is a costly benefit because a similar form must be filled in every few months to legitimise and control payment of family credit? Will he also respond to the fact that, for many part-time workers, the payment was unpredictable because their working lives are not regular and the amount of their part-time work varies? They could not trust the payments and were very unsure about treating family credit as an operational feature of their family income.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady raises some interesting points, but the working families tax credit system is no different from family credit. The main differences between working families tax credit and family credit is that the taper is shallower, the income level at which it starts to apply to the working families tax credit is £10 higher, and the new credit is paid through the payroll. Those are the three key differences between working families tax credit and family credit.<br><br>
9.15 am<br><br>
The slow take-up to which the hon. Lady referred is inevitable with any new benefit. There are now 776,000 people claiming family credit, which is a 72 per cent. take-up rate by caseload and an 84 per cent. take-up rate by expenditure. Few people who can claim are not claiming. The only people who are not claiming are those who would be entitled under the formula to a very small sum and believe that it is not worth claiming, which is why there is an 84 per cent. take-up rate by expenditure. That implies that is not worth the while of the remaining people to claim. The take-up rate is very high and I challenge the hon. Lady to come up with any other benefit with such a high take-up rate. If she is convinced that working families tax credit will be more successful in take-up than family credit, why have no Ministers said whether they expect the take-up rate to be higher or lower and, if higher, what level they expect? All we have heard from Ministers is that 1.3 million people will claim the benefit. They have not given an expected take-up figure.<br><br>
The hon. Lady referred to forms being filled in every few weeks. The new benefit will apply for six months, as does family credit. Despite any changes in family circumstances during that period, payment of family credit does not change. That will apply also to working families tax credit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Julie Kirkbride <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bromsgrove)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend always makes good points, but he may have missed one small matter. The Government stated that 1.3 million people will be able to claim the new family tax credit, but that relates only to the greater generosity of the benefit and not to new claimants; it merely reflects the greater generosity of the benefit and the extension of the taper.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 48</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The £1.5 billion of extra spending is being spent mainly on the shallower taper and moving the benefit up the income scale.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb) referred to the naming of the new benefit as a tax credit and the fact that it will appear on the pay slip. Will that reference to the benefit on the pay slip increase or reduce stigma? Conservative Members believe that had the benefit applied through the PAYE code, it might have reduced stigma, but because it will appear separately on the pay slip, it will present a problem. Under clause 5(2) regulations will be introduced
<br><blockquote><p>"requiring employers to provide information to employees (in their itemised pay statement or otherwise)".</p></blockquote>
Page 8 of the glossy document, which sets out how the scheme will work, states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The amount of tax credit paid will need to be shown separately on the employee's payslip."</p></blockquote>
The regulations that we received at 10 o'clock last night state—I raise this merely to try to impress my hon. Friends that I have read them—under regulation 5(3):
<br><blockquote><p>"The employer shall record on the employee's payslip for the relevant pay period, as a credit described as a 'tax credit', any payment made under paragraph (2)."</p></blockquote>
Does the appearance of the words "tax credit" help to reduce stigma? It may be argued that referring to it as a "tax credit" instead of "working families tax credit" will reduce stigma, but no one in the payroll department of a firm, company or small business would be confused by that phrase. It clearly means a state benefit because no one's mortgage tax relief is on their payslip. People will know that the phrase, "tax credit" refers to the working families tax credit, and that if they see that phrase on someone's payslip, that person is in receipt of a state benefit.<br><br>
We want the word, "tax" to be removed from the clause because, as all employers' organisations that have sent representations to Committee members have said, it is a benefit rather than a tax credit. As my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) said on Tuesday, the Government's proposal is really a rebranding of an existing benefit—the family credit benefit—with small changes to the taper and a minor rise in the level of benefit. Ultimately, the only difference between the working families tax credit and the family credit benefit is the delivery mechanism—it will be done through the payroll, which does not change the payment's nature, namely that it is a state benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My perspective has improved somewhat since recovering my glasses.<br><br>
The amendments are epitomised by the clause's title, which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Certain benefits to be known as tax credits."</p></blockquote>
Far be it from me to suggest that the Paymaster General is a Marxist—she is a glowing member of new Labour—but there is a Marxist dictum that to undermine the existing order, one must first debase the language and, if I remember rightly, the currency.<br><br>
I have an interest to declare: as president of the Conservative family campaign, I have taken a close interest over the past 10 years in how taxes and benefits
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0386">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 49</span>
impact on the family structure. I want to identify the two main reasons why so many people are coming round to the view that the tax system rather than the benefit system should play a larger role in looking after families, and I want to show why the Government's proposal meets neither of those criteria. As such, the clause is wrongly labelled, which is the point that lies behind the six amendments to which my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar spoke.<br><br>
I can outline my two reasons simply and quickly. The first was referred to earlier as the problem of "churning." Many years ago, several independent-minded Back Benchers on both sides of the House pointed out that it seemed an absolute nonsense on the one hand to tax people with income tax, which is expensive to collect, and, on the other, to pay out means-tested benefits, which are expensive to deliver. As such, there is a strong case for saying. "Let's get these people out of the tax system on administrative grounds alone."<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) has already alluded to the fact that attempts to get the Government's proposal into the tax code have failed. The Inland Revenue spent much time examining the proposal—it studied several different models, but, even in the era of computerisation, it found that it could not be done, and the fact that it proved to be impossible was not simply a question of mathematics.<br><br>
That shows that the Government's proposal involves no administrative simplification. Our system of organisation continues to involve the calculation of a tax, on which a benefit is calculated, which gets fed back on a six-monthly basis into the tax system. That system involves exactly the same administrative complexities as the current family credit benefit. No administrative simplification is involved.<br><br>
I do not want to return to the speech that I made on Second Reading—you, Mrs. Roe, would rule it out of order—but the proposed system will bring employers into the calculation and, as such, it will add another dimension of complexity. It will also reach further up the income scale, thereby bringing more people into that complex arrangement.<br><br>
On the first of the two criteria, the Government's proposal clearly fails. The Government want the proposal labelled as a tax credit, but it is a benefit. Within a couple of years of entering the House of Commons, I came around to the point of view held by the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) and Sir Brandon Rhys Williams. I wish I had entered the House one year earlier and voted against the 1988 benefits changes, which took us along the road that the Government are now taking us further down.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Collins <span class='memberconstituency'>(Westmorland and Lonsdale)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is making a powerful case. Would he reflect on remarks—which might explain the reasons for the Government's rebranding of the benefit as a tax measure—made on my birthday in 1997 by the Prime Minister, who said that he had told Ministers at the Department of Social Security to consider reducing social security bills? This rebranding measure shifts £4 billion

from the DSS spending line to—I suppose—the Treasury tax cut line. That may be the simple and sole reason for the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, I fully appreciated the significance of my hon. Friend's birthday. He is absolutely right, and I am perhaps being a little naive. Perhaps a straightforward "Political" point underlies the measure. I accept my hon. Friend's point that it is a way of dishonestly disguising social security expenditure as a tax benefit. None the less, I shall press on with the two well-worked and well-thought-through theoretical points.<br><br>
The second reason is a little more difficult to outline than that relating to churning, but it is even more important. A family can be lifted out of the tax system with a sufficient structure of tax allowances to ensure that it can support itself without benefits. The national insurance and tax takes, even where extra benefits such as housing benefit exist, tend to be at a level that leaves people with a decent incentive to earn more, work overtime, undertaking training and improve their lot. To use the Prime Minister's phrase, they are more interested in a hand up than a hand out.<br><br>
If the measure took a step in that direction, I would stand up and cheer it—I made myself unpopular with a number of Ministers in the previous Government by continually speaking against their benefits policy. But the measure does not take such a step. The reason for that is not obscure or difficult, but simply that it is a focused measure rather than a universal measure. Universal measures appear to be expensive—although I have never understood how taking less tax can be expensive—but by focusing on a target group, the Government are forced to impose a taper. The taper reaches all the way up—as was pointed out on Second Reading, to which I shall not allude at length—to £37,000. The taper on working families tax credit is therefore imposed on top of income tax, national insurance withdrawals, housing benefit, council tax benefit and so on.<br><br>
The result, which was a point made eloquently and often by Sir Brandon Rhys Williams and the right hon. Member for Birkenhead is to leave people with little or no incentive to better themselves. We have not seen the regulations yet—they arrived just before midnight last night, and it will require a lot of hard work and calculation to see how they work—but if the child care tax credit and its taper is included, two extra tapers will be imposed on top of income tax, national insurance, means-tested housing benefit, council tax benefit and so on. A much larger body of people will be struck in what is very nearly a trap—one can argue that it is not quite a trap because it does not rise above 100 per cent., but they will be stuck on very high rates of marginal tax and benefit withdrawal, now working families tax credit withdrawal. That is the second reason why what the Government claim is a tax relief fails to achieve what a true tax relief would achieve.<br><br>
I hope that I have explained why I support the amendments. There are no grounds whatever for relabelling this benefit a tax relief, other than the purely nominal point that it will be raised through the Revenue—and even that is specious because the Government are introducing another measure, which will provide for national insurance contributions to be raised through the Revenue.<br><br>

9.30 am<br><br>
Three or even four Labour Members intervened during our previous sitting to challenge Conservative Front-Bench Members on what they would do about the issue. Those Conservative Members replied that they could not be expected to produce detailed measures at this stage. Indeed, when I served on the Committee that considered the Bill to introduce the poll tax, the Labour Opposition produced no alternatives. They did not need to because we had to abandon the idea within a couple of years, as, I believe, this Government will have to abandon this measure.<br><br>
None the less, I shall say what I would do. For eight years, I have argued that the only way to solve the problem is to do what the Government are pretending to do under clause 1: solve the problem through the tax system and introduce a decent collection of transferable allowances and child allowances, so that low-income families are taken out of the tax system completely.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Jacqui Lait (Beckenham))</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise to support my hon. Friends' amendment, which would remove the word, "tax" from the Bill. I support the amendment for much the same reasons as those that have already been explained. As has been shown, the tax credit is equal to the current benefit, and has merely been moved from one Department to another. It reminds me slightly of what is called in the City "creative accounting". Companies that indulge in creative accounting tend to come to grief. I contend that the Government are likely to come to grief with these proposals, because they have not calculated the real cost of the benefit.<br><br>
Logically and sensibly, people act in their best economic interests, and if generous tax allowances are available, they will order their affairs in order to maximise their income. It is a well known phenomenon. The Labour party is prone to attacking people at the top end of the income scale for araraging their tax affairs to maximise their income. However, provided that it is not tax evasion, of which none of us approves, I have no problem with people at the top end of the income scale arranging their affairs to maximise their income. Equally, I have no problem with people at the lower end of the income scale doing precisely the same. They would be foolish not to. My experience, both as former Member for Hastings and Rye and now, as Member for Beckenham, is that people visit my surgery, week after week, and say "I need to maximise my income. I am told that the best way to do that is to go on benefits or stay on benefits". I have an opinion about what such people should do, but it is difficult to argue against them organising their affairs in order to maximise their income. Should the Government make available very generous tax credits—we prefer to call them benefits—the number of people claiming the benefit will substantially increase.<br><br>
Therefore, I have no difficulty whatever in supporting the Institute for Fiscal Studies' estimate that it will cost £4 billion. When I first brought up the subject in the women's day debate last year, I was the only person to do so. The debate took place before the Budget, and we were dealing in speculation. At that time, I was easily able to calculate that the total cost, taking away all the family credit benefits that the Conservatives had put in place,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 52</span>
would be between £10 billion and £15 billion if people behaved logically, as I fundamentally believe that they will. That is one reason why the Government have found themselves on a hook. They will find it difficult to get off it merely by moving the benefit from the Department of Social Security to the Treasury. Not only will that cost a lot, but it will have businesses complaining bitterly.<br><br>
We have had the draft regulatory impact study for only a few hours—I saw it only after 10 o'clock last night. It was a case of putting a cold towel round my head and concentrating hard, but I have had a good look at the study. Far be it from me to suggest that the Paymaster General has made a mistake—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roger Casale <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wimbledon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Lait</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will just finish the point. The regulatory impact assessment impinges on clause 1. I will explain why once I have answered the hon. Gentleman's question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Casale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady said that there would merely be a transfer of authority from the benefits budget to the Inland Revenue and that we were talking about nothing more. Before that, however, she began to argue about incentives for people on the lower and higher ends of the income scale. Will she explain why working people will have less incentive to work and increase their incomes under working families tax credits than they do under the current system of family benefits? Will she set out the two scenarios and argue her case through, rather than simply stating it into the air?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Lait</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has only recently joined the House and may not have had as much experience as some of us of surgery cases. People come to us and explain precisely how they will maximise their income. I have no difficulty with that. Somebody who wants to maximise his income has every right to do so, regardless of whether he does it by working and claiming tax credits or the credit before us, or by staying out of work and—far be it from me to suggest this—claiming benefits while working in the black economy. I could suggest that some of the reduction in the unemployment figures can be put down to that phenomenon, but that would take me right out of order—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Completely out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Lait</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Tempting though it was.<br><br>
May I return to the reason why the draft regulatory impact assessment impacts on the clause? Our amendments show why the clause will impact on employers. It is clearly up to employers to pay the credit. The amendments remove the word "tax" from the clause and imply that employers no longer pay for the credit. The provision will be expensive for employers. The estimate in the draft—which seems to have been arrived at using slightly rose-tinted spectacles—is that the cost to small employers will be about £35 a year. That depends, however, on how much small employers earn and on how many hours they spend on the credit. If they spend 10 hours over the year, they will be paying themselves at
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0388">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 53</span>
employment rates of £3.50 an hour, which is not even the minimum wage. The estimates in the impact assessment are, therefore, significant underestimates. I hope that the Paymaster General can explain matters in greater detail. We will seek comments from small businesses about the practicalities of the sum involved.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) referred eloquently to the problem of churning, about which I had already spoken. The proposed system will cause an expensive administrative churning of benefits, and in due course the National Audit Office will realise that it is a complete waste of money. That is a further consequence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In her eloquent discourse, my hon. Friend reminded me of a conversation that I have had. I realised that the poll tax was fated to utter disaster when a constituent of mine who had just retired from the Inland Revenue sat down and explained to me how the tax was uncollectible. The Inland Revenue has made it clear that it is impossible to devise a tax code that works for the provisions. Surely that suggests the same fate for the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Lait</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to my hon. Friend. He merely reinforced the point that he made in his eloquent speech, and which I am trying amateurishly to make as well.<br><br>
When the Conservative party was in government, Conservative Members were attacked time and again by the then Opposition for encouraging low-pay policies through what they called the generosity of our family credit, which they said was allowing employers to pay low wages. The impact of the Bill will be precisely the same, even with a minimum wage of £3.60, which will impact heavily on a number of industries. Currently many companies pay more than £3.60 an hour, but under the Bill they will have no incentive to pay a penny more because taxpayers will pay the extra.<br><br>
That is one of the Bill's fundamental flaws, which will reinforce what the Labour Opposition called the low-pay culture, and which Conservative Members firmly believe is the first step in employment. There is no chance of raising pay, unless it is done by regulation and statute to increase the minimum, which will put businesses in some sectors of the economy under greater pressure. The culture of low pay, criticised by the Labour party when in opposition will be reinforced.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Claire Ward <span class='memberconstituency'>(Watford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: How can the hon. Lady use those arguments about employers paying low wages when her Government introduced family credit?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Lait</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady must recognise that the Opposition have a different approach to pay: we regard pay as an opportunity to advance, whereas the Government regard it as something into which people are blocked and set. The Bill will reinforce the low-pay culture that they attacked so eloquently in opposition. I am sorry to break that news to the hon. Lady.<br><br>
Having pointed out how ineffective the credit will be as administered by the Treasury, and having spoken in support of the amendments seeking to remove the word, "tax" from the clause, I draw my remarks to a speedy end.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 54</span>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Kirkbride</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to endorse many of the comments made by my hon. Friends about the Government's proposals, and to speak in support of the amendments that seek to take the word, "tax" out of tax credits. The proposed system is really family credit with a different delivery mechanism. I do not believe that it will achieve many of the things that the Government intend. It is deeply misguided and could in time become a serious administrative nightmare for the Government. That makes me wonder how they arrived at that position. I think that what happened was that Labour in opposition, desperate to return to power after 18 years in the wilderness, was keen on its own public relations and spin and the idea that, if only it handled things better, everything would be all right. Labour also knew that the British public were deeply concerned about social security in general, how it was distributed and its cost.<br><br>
The Government are introducing the working families tax credit for those two reasons. The Prime Minister appealed to the British public with the idea that we must "think the unthinkable" on social security—that we needed new, big ideas to make things all right, so that social security would be not a millstone around our necks, but a great benefit to our citizens. At the same time, he encouraged the public to believe that, in thinking the unthinkable, he would cut the cost of welfare. We all know that, far from doing so, the Labour Government have already massively increased the welfare bill by much more than their trumpeted increase in health and social security spending—by about £38 billion, on the projected forecasts.<br><br>
9.45 am<br><br>
As we discovered to our cost when in government, projected forecasts do not always turn out to be accurate. Once people pick up the idea of new benefits, they become more attractive. The expected cost of benefit is much less than the real cost. I fear that the increased cost will be considerably more than the current estimate of £38 billion.<br><br>
The Labour party was desperate to find a big idea, and it was keen to pinch the idea of the working families tax credit, which has been in effect for some time in the United States—where it has caused problems—along with many other American branding mechanisms. Much of President Clinton's campaign style was mirrored by the Labour party's election campaign. The working families tax credit appeared to fit in with all of that, because it sounded wholesome and good, it reinforced the attempt to persuade the British public that the Labour party offered something exciting and different that would change the world—that was the pitch. That is how the Labour party arrived at the working families tax credit—not by thinking it through.<br><br>
The working families tax credit also had the neat advantage that it could be off balance sheet. The Paymaster General is in Committee because instead of calling it a social security benefit and accounting for it in the Department of Social Security, the Government call it a tax benefit. A huge part of the £5 billion expenditure
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0389">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 55</span>
is being transferred from the social security budget and apparently lost. My hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton knows better, because as a former accountant he knows exactly which part of the Treasury forecast accounts for it. If I recollect correctly, it falls under "minor adjustments", it is not properly accounted for.<br><br>
A member of the public asking this supposedly open Government, "Where is my money spent?" could not see that the working families tax credit costs him as a taxpayer £5 billion. It is buried under the bottom line, in italics at the bottom of the page, under "minor accounting adjustments".<br><br>
The Government introduced the credit because of its two nest advantages. The problem is that, having thought of a big idea and announced it, the Government are now between a rock and a hard place. How will it work? It will not work as a pure tax credit, as does the American system; it will remain essentially a benefit administered by the Benefits Agency. People will have to apply for it in the same way as they do for family credit. There will be no real difference in that respect. People will still have to apply in exactly the same way, but the delivery mechanism will change. The benefit will be paid through the employer instead of by cheque from the Benefits Agency. That is the only difference between the existing family credit and the new working families tax credit.<br><br>
The Government have said that millions more people will be able to go back to work, but they have not been brave enough to put an exact figure on that. The 1.3 million people who, they say, will claim the credit are already claiming it—the change will merely draw more people into the net. It will not attract new people into employment. That is the conclusion to be drawn from the Government's figures.<br><br>
The Institute for Fiscal Studies has calculated that there will be 40,000 new entrants to the labour market as a result of the changes. That is an incredibly meagre amount of people. I have not been in the House for long, but I observed it for many years as a journalist in the Lobby. That incredible change will upset many employers—when they wake up to what is to happen to them—for the sake of only 40,000 more people going to work, who could well be pushed into it in another way. I suspect that the Government will come to regret this undertaking.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Casale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Lady suggesting that encouraging 40,000 more people into the labour market and helping them to find work is not a worthwhile objective?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Kirkbride</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman completely misses my point. I am saying that the Government are introducing an overly bureaucratic change, which lacks proportion in relation to its potential benefits. The prospect of 40,000 people going back to work is welcome, but there must be many other ways of achieving that without changing the entire system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Lait</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Institute for Fiscal Studies is right that only 40,000 people will go back to work, the cost of £1.5 billion works out at £35,000 a job. Is it not likely
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 56</span>
that many more people will try to claim the benefit—hence the IFS's other predicted cost of £4 billion for the child care tax credit alone?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Kirkbride</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point. In addition to the difficulties that the benefit will cause employers, it unleashes the potential for a hugh cost to the Treasury in child care tax credit. It is a shame that the scope of the Bill does not allow us to discuss that in greater detail. I fear that the Treasury will be in for a great shock when people begin to understand how the tax credit could make a difference to their income. The introduction of new benefits often has a hugh behavioural impact. It takes time before people realise what the impact on their incomes might be. It has been predicted that the level of take-up of many benefits will result in a relatively modest cost to the Exchequer and yet, some years later, lo and behold, the cost is found to have grown out of all proportion to Ministers' expectations. I confidently predict that the child care tax credit will fall into that category.<br><br>
The problem that the Government have in selling their big idea is exemplified by the evidence that was given to the Select Committee on Social Security by Martin Taylor, the former chairman of Barclays bank, who was the Government's guru on the development of the working families tax credit. He confidently told members of the Committee that it was a great idea. His gut feeling was that calling it a tax credit, instead of a benefit, would mean that more people would go back out to work. That was his view and he thought that we should accept it. He could not draw our attention to any relevant studies, or to any experiences elsewhere in the world, to prove that calling it a tax credit instead of a benefit would have the incredible behavioural effect of sending people out to work. Nevertheless, he believed that it was more likely to happen than not and he intended to proceed on that basis. However, he also said that, as he confidently expected the benefit to be paid through the tax coding, it would be a simple change, straightforwardly administered, and would result in the behavioural effect that has been suggested.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Webb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Unlike the hon. Lady, I am not a member of the Social Security Committee, but from what I have seen of the minutes, we may be traducing Martin Taylor somewhat by describing him as the architect of the scheme. Am I right that he said in his evidence that he was told that there would be a tax credit, so he devoted most of his attentions to national insurance reform? Therefore, the Chancellor is really responsible for the scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Kirkbride</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a wonderful point, as he usually does in his interventions on social security debates. I would not gainsay what he has said.<br><br>
As the hon. Gentleman says, Martin Taylor was interested in the national insurance changes; he also believed that the working families tax credit scheme could be implemented through the tax coding. So we took it on trust that that would happen and started our cross-examination of Treasury officials on that basis. They looked at us rather gravely and said that it could not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0390">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 57</span>
be done in that way. They had run a lot of models through the tax coding to see whether such a thing was possible, but it leads to distortion in just a few weeks. They said that it would have to be a separate item on the payroll.<br><br>
This came as a great shock to all members of that Committee, not merely to Conservative Members. We were suddenly faced with a very different change from the one that the Government had proposed. That is fundamental to the problems involved in changing family credit to the working families tax credit. Without the simplicity of doing it through the tax coding, it is not worth the changes that will have to be made.<br><br>
Putting that separate item on the payroll will be a terrible imposition on businesses, especially very small businesses, which are mainly likely to employ people who are eligible for the working families tax credit. That is not to say that problems will not also be felt higher up the system. There will be people in big plcs who will also be eligible for working families tax credit. However, by far the greatest impact will be on the smaller businesses, which already feel overburdened by Government regulations, especially those which have been introduced in the past 18 months. Lo and behold, now there is an even bigger regulation coming down the tracks, and I warn Labour Members that people have not yet even begun to wake up to it.<br><br>
Just the other day, I was having my bracelet fixed in a little jewellery shop in Bromsgrove high street. I told the owner about the change and his face went white. He said, "I have had enough. Here I am, trying to sell my watches, clocks and gold necklaces for Christmas and all I get is more regulations. Why do I bother? I'm glad that I'm going to be 65 soon and that I can retire. I certainly wouldn't suggest that my son does this."<br><br>
Small businesses have not realised what the Government are about to do to them, or the burden that will be imposed on them. When they do wake up to it, Labour Members will get a shock, because the many disgruntled business men in their constituencies will have a lot to say about the Government's regulatory burden.<br><br>
I accept what the hon. Member for Watford (Ms Ward) said about the problems of family credit, there was always that potential for collusion with employers who would try and abuse the system to pay low wages. The hon. Lady should reflect on how much greater the potential for such abuse will be when employers, by definition, are forced to understand the working families tax credit to administer it. At the moment, there is anonymity—employers do not necessarily know who in their work force gets it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alan Johnson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hull, West and Hessle)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes they do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Kirkbride</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman intervenes from a sedentary position, but I beg to differ. I suspect, however, that employers can surmise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To help the hon. Lady, the pay claims that are made by an employee for family credit have to be verified by the employer, so the employer knows that a claim is being made when he or she verifies the wages.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 58</span>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Kirkbride</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I fear that the new system will make such information much more transparent because it will appear on the wage slip.<br><br>
Furthermore, with regard to the point made by the hon. Member for Watford, employers will have to understand the system; that is the difference. They will have to understand who the mechanisms work to know who is eligible for what level of working families tax credit. The minute that some unscrupulous employers understand that, they will use it as a depressant on wages. They will tell an employee, "I will pay you X so that you can claim Y". Because they are obliged by the new system to understand how the working families tax credit works, they will know how they can alter wages.</span></p>
<p>10 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Ward</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady does not seem to be getting the point. Under the current system, the employer is required to know who is claiming family credit, so her argument—and that of her hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait)—that the new system will make matters worse is wrong. With the introduction of the minimum wage package, there is a much greater chance that employees will be far better off under the new system than under the current system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Kirkbride</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the hon. Lady says, but we must agree to differ. Employers will know how much employees get in their wage packets, whereas previously there was much less clarity about the family credit benefit. Employers will now have to understand the system.<br><br>
Some employers will not collect sufficient money in taxation from their employees to pay them the working families tax credit and will have to apply to the Inland Revenue for a cash float. Thus, there will be much greater clarity in the system and much more understanding on the part of employers. I therefore contend—although Conservative Members clearly differ from the Government on this—that there will also be a much greater chance that some employers will manipulate the system, because they will see the advantages of getting the state to pay some of their wages.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Lait</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the new system will mean that more people will officially know about claims than did before, hence more employees will feel that their affairs are more open to scrutiny by a wider audience in any company?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Kirkbride</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point. Moreover, there will be a stigma attached to the working families tax credit because everyone in the company will know who is claiming—or who is eligible. It will be an open secret from pay slips. The benefit will be much more open to scrutiny and could therefore be an embarrassment to some people, who would not want their fellow employees to know that they are claiming a state benefit—whatever it is called.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Stockton, South (Ms Taylor) made some curious points, if I may say so. Her argument would lead to maintaining the family credit system. When the hon. Lady intervened on my hon. Friend the Member
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0391">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 59</span>
for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, she claimed that take-up had been slow. Yes, it was slow to begin with because it was a totally new benefit and, at the time, a totally new concept—perhaps it was a misguided concept, but it was certainly new, In fact, take-up is now incredibly high—for a social security benefit—because people understand what they are entitled to. Conservative Members believe that one of the good things about family credit is that people understand it and claim it. In broad terms, it is a success because it has had a good take-up and therefore has matched our expectations for it.<br><br>
The hon. member for Stockton, South was also concerned about the security of knowing that payments will come through under the family credit system. Again, that system was a much more robust and secure delivery mechanism, because the credit came as a cheque from the Benefits Agency through the front door. The hon. Lady shakes her head but if, under the new system, a company suddenly disappears or goes bankrupt, where will the employees' money come from? They expect a pay cheque every week, which pays them not only their pay but their benefit. If a company goes bankrupt or if an employer has not got his act together to claim back money from the Treasury to have a sufficient cash float to pay the benefit, suddenly the employee will not have the money. I argue strenuously that under the new system there is a significant possibility that people will be left vulnerable and without money, because the company for which they are working has disappeared, gone bankrupt or not got its act together and cannot pay the working families tax credit that is owing to some of its employees.<br><br>
The hon. Lady should consider that point, because one the working families tax credit is in place many of her constituents may come to her saying precisely that. Under the old family credit system they knew that the money was coming through the post, but under this system their employer, whom they never thought much of, can suddenly do a runner on them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend accepted interventions from the hon. Member for Stockton, South which suggested that there was no substantial difference between the systems. My hon. Friend's instincts were right. When a person originally claims, he has to send the employer a discreet letter. The difference is this: under family credit, on renewal the employer simply accepts pay slips; now the employer will have a reminder every week.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Kirkbride</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friend for explaining that point, because the Government Front Bench's earlier intervention was deliberately misleading. My hon. Friend has greater knowledge of these issues than I have. Nevertheless, there will be a substantial difference for employers, as my hon. Friend explained.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In no way did I seek to mislead the Committee. The record will show that the hon. Lady said that employers did not know when people were claiming family credit. I merely pointed out, to assist her, that in the majority of cases they would know.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Paymaster General is doing my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove a grave injustice. All that the employer knows at present is that at one time in the past an employee applied for family credit. The employer has no idea whether the person is getting family credit now. The working families tax credit involves the employer week on week in their employees' private affairs.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Miss Kirkbride</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Lady intervening?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can I make an intervention as a point of fact? I do not know how I do it in the Committee. I ask for your guidance, Mrs. Roe.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Lady is making a point of order on the way in which the Committee is being run, that is fine. If she wants to intervene she should direct her remarks to the hon. Member who is on her feet. Will the hon. Lady tell me exactly what she wants to ask?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mrs. Roe. I wanted to make an intervention on the Front-Bench spokesperson.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members may not intervene on an intervention. The hon. Lady may intervene only on the speech being made at this moment by the hon. Member for Bromsgrove, (Miss Kirkbride). She may want to do so to elaborate on a point that she is making, in which case the hon. Lady can leave some of the points. However, I am sure that the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar will speak later, so the hon. Lady will be able to make her point direct to him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to you, Mrs. Roe.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Miss Kirkbride</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On that exciting point, as we wait to hear what the hon. Member for Stockton, South says to my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar, I shall close my remarks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mrs. Roe, good morning. In responding to the Opposition's amendments, I shall try to help the Committee—I hope that it will be help—on the figure that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton was given when he asked the Library to calculate the different income from family credit and working families tax credit. The hon. Gentleman said that there was no difference. Just for the record, the figure of £187.19 that he obtained from the Library is incorrect. It used the post-April 1999 family credit rates—that is fine—but then it used the working families tax credit earnings threshold rather than the post-April 1999 family credit threshold. That makes a difference of £10 a week.<br><br>
I do not wish to detract from the hon. Gentleman's general views on the Bill or the clause, or the comments of other hon. Members but it helps to have the correct
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0392">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 61</span>
calculation. I am happy to send it to the hon. Gentleman and for him to pursue the matter if he is unhappy with my answer, but the difference is £10 and not £3.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Webb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, the figures are slightly out. As the Paymaster General has the figures in front of her, can she say what figure corresponds to the £10,000 under working famines tax credit for a person working the same hours in the same circumstances on family credit? What is the difference between those two numbers?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman referring to the calculation that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton used, which came out at £187? That should have been £181 and, for the working families tax credit, £191.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Webb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I understand the Paymaster General, she is saying that the £10,000 a year that a person will receive form a full-time job and the working families tax credit is to be compared with £10 a week less, or £500 a year. Is she saying that the corresponding figure for a person on family credit is £9,500 and that, as a result of the Government's policy, a full-time job that used to guarantee £9,500 now guarantees £10,000?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The figures are clear. The hon. Gentleman can work them out. I was addressing the point about family credit as the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton calculated it, and working families tax credit. The other element that was missing from his calculation, which I left out as well, is the effect of the child care tax credit.<br><br>
I realise that the Committee will want to discuss these issues in some detail, but the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton made the point again this morning and I thought it best to point out that some incorrect assumptions have been made which I am sure he would like to check.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Lait</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are most grateful for that information, which we have no reason to doubt. We understand how the Library got in a muddle. On the basis of the Paymaster General's correct and more generous interpretation, will she revise her estimate of the number of families who will start to claim working families tax credit?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. It does not matter whether the Library made an error or was given incorrect information. I am merely trying to provide the right figure. The Government's view on take up is clear: additional people will be entitled to claim working families tax credit. The number of eligible people will increase to 1.3 million. I do not understand why I should revise that figure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Paymaster General give way?</span></p>
<p>10.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman allows me to answer the questions that have been posed, he may find his question answered.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 62</span>
I am delighted that the hon. Member for Canterbury found his glasses. It must be a great relief to Opposition Members that they no longer have to share.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman has argued his views on the family for some time. I do not agree with them, but I respect them. The difference that he drew between transferable allowances and the assistance that the Government want to give through the working families tax credit was fair enough because it outlined the difference between the hon. Member for Canterbury and the Government. However, I am not sure that his opinion is widely held or reflects Opposition policy.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned hiding and increasing social security expenditure. The real average growth in Department of Social Security expenditure, including the working families tax credit, is 2 per cent. a year over this Parliament. That compares with 4 per cent. in the last Parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The figure of 2 per cent. is a forecast whereas the figure of 4 per cent. is an actual. The forecast of growth in social security expenditure that we optimistically produced in 1988 was modest. I believe that the figure will be much higher than 2 per cent. because, as the right hon. Member for Birkenhead and my former colleague Sir Brandon Rhys Williams said, the incentives to stay in the system and not to better oneself because of high tapers will be extended up the income scale.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman made the point that working families tax credit expenditure will be hidden because it is being transferred from social security expenditure to the tax system. I am trying to explain, even if he is not reassured, that that is not the case. Expected growth in expenditure, including working families tax credit, is 2 per cent. over this Parliament. He argued that working families tax credit is not included in that figure because we have hidden it. I have answered that point.<br><br>
There has been a great deal of discussion about the identification of expenditure, to which both the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Beckenham referred.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Paymaster General give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will be happy to give way when I have finished this point.<br><br>
It was suggested that expenditure on the working families tax credit would not be included in the Government's accounts, and that it would not be open to scrutiny, but will be hidden away. That is incorrect. Opposition Members have forecast what they think will occur and painted a picture of doom. When the figures are available, they will be able to see whether they were right or not, but the cost will not be hidden away.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What a pleasure it is to see the hon. Lady in her place. I am sure that she took the opportunity to read the Committee's deliberations and understands that the matter was discussed extensively at the previous sitting.<br><br>
However, I put it to her that there was an attempt by the Government to hide the figures, and that it is only due to the Office of National Statistics that the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0393">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 63</span>
figures are now in the open. I also put it to her that the figures for the last two years of the Conservative Government show a 1 per cent. drop in social security spending and then a 1 per cent. increase; and now the present Government's proposals will cause a 5 per cent., 2.7 per cent. and 3.4 per cent. change over the next three years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course I read the <i>Official Report</i> of the Committee's previous sitting, as I am sure all Committee members did in order to remind themselves of the points that were made.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar will know that the ONS accounting rules under the European system mean that the cost of working families tax credit will be included in the presentation of the national accounts public expenditure aggregate. I think that that was what he wanted me to confirm and that it deals with the points raised by Opposition Members about expenditure being concealed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady confirm that the expenditure will be included in the social security line of the Red Book?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a tax credit and it will appear as a tax credit, although I realise that Opposition Members do not wish to accept the argument.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Beckenham also referred to the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates for the cost of child care tax credit. In replying to the debate, I am being careful not to stray too far from the amendments, Mrs. Roe.<br><br>
The hon. Lady probably knows that the IFS uses a scenario in which there is a complete shift from informal, unregistered child care to formal registered child care; but there is no reason why that should happen. It just gives the IFS nice big round figures. I know that the hon. Lady has followed the issue closely. Indeed, on Second Reading, in an intervention on my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, she discussed the nature of child care provisions, both formal and informal, that parents would choose.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Paymaster General give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I finish my sentence?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My intervention might be helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that all the hon. Gentleman's interventions are helpful. I simply want to finish my sentence.<br><br>
The child care tax credit will give parents the choice. There is no suggestion that every parent will abandon his or her informal relationship, which is better for some parents: it suits their working practices and they think that it is better for their children.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to help the Committee and the Paymaster General. The hon. Lady appears to have turned over two pages of her brief, no doubt from pressure of work and because she wants to make progress. We are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 64</span>
currently discussing not the child care amendments, which we shall reach in a few moments, but whether the Government's proposals involve a tax credit. However, she was making some wonderful points, and I look forward to hearing her speech again—perhaps in half an hour.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me offer to do a deal with the hon. Gentleman. Does he want me to discuss only the amendments and to ignore the comments and questions that Opposition Members put to me? Those comments and questions have nothing to do with the amendments but, out of courtesy, I was responding to them. If he will not complain about the fact that I have not answered those questions, I should be happy not to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. If anything was out of order, I have made a note of it. The Paymaster General should continue with her speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, Mrs. Roe, I knew that you would take note of that. I have been careful to give courteous answers without straying too far from the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No disrespect was intended.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If those on the Government Front Bench and the Opposition Front Bench keep this up, Mrs. Roe, you are in danger of being killed by niceness. However, in my attempts to keep my contributions in order I enjoy the comments of the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar, and I appreciate his persistence.<br><br>
The amendments raise the question of whether the word "tax" should be in the Bill. Opposition Members dispute whether moving the working families tax credit into the tax system and paying it through the wage packet—thereby rewarding work—will, as we believe, give people the right incentives, encourage them to work more and, because of the change in the tapers, let them gain more and keep more. It is odd that the Opposition do not agree with the work incentive or the need for encouragement.<br><br>
Family income supplement, which was the predecessor of family credit benefit and which we discussed in our previous sitting, was intended by the previous Government to be the first step in an attempt to unify the taxes and benefits that apply to working families and to give those families incentives to work. That system had its problems, and it was superseded by family credit benefit, for which the rationale again involved incentives to work—to work more, to be paid more and to get appropriate rewards.<br><br>
There have been many discussions about whether those incentives work. Opposition Members say that they will not, but our clear contention is that having a tax credit in the tax system that is paid through the wage packet underlines the fact that work pays and that, because of the change in the tapers, the more one works the greater one's pay and the more one keeps. That is why it is essential to use the tax credit system.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0394">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 65</span>
It is not often that I quote the Confederation of British Industry to support my argument—indeed, it may be quoted against the later in our consideration of the Bill. However, in its press release of 26 January 1999, it said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Confederation of British Industry believes that the Working Families Tax Credit has the potential to play a very important role in raising incentives to work."</p></blockquote>
We are therefore not alone in our view.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The press release continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"We have some real reservations about how well the system will work in practice."</p></blockquote>
It goes on to make reference to burdens and to stigma.<br><br>
If the Paymaster General is so persuaded by the incentive effect of the working families tax credit, will she give the Committee her estimate of the take-up rate? Will it be higher or lower than that for family credit? If it will be higher, what percentage does she expect?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In seeking assurances from the Government, the press release goes on to say some other things about the working families tax credit. Hon. Members will doubtless raise those points in due course.<br><br>
The central points that have been raised are the use of the word, "tax", and the question of tax incentives and incentives to work. I have pointed out to the Committee that the Government are not alone in believing that the provision, which is part of an important package of reforms, will create a very strong incentive to work.<br><br>
10.30 am<br><br>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton repeatedly asked about the question of eligibility on Second Reading, as well. Up to 1.3 million families will be eligible, although I recall that he was not satisfied with that answer. The Government will seek to ensure that those who are eligible claim their entitlement under the working families tax credit. The 800,000 families who currently receive family credit will automatically receive reminders for working families tax credit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Paymaster General talks about eligibility, which provides the denominator. Is she therefore saying that the take-up rate numerator will be 100 per cent.? She has said that she expects all those who are eligible for the new tax credit to raise the take-up rate. Does she now predict that the family credit take-up rate of 72 per cent. will increase to 100 per cent. under the working families tax credit?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am saying what I hope the previous Government said about family credit: Governments have a duty to ensure that people receive their entitlements. We will strive to ensure maximum take-up but, as the hon. Gentleman knows, I cannot forecast the exact rate. The point that I am trying to make is about eligibility.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 66</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Webb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Paymaster General give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will give way to the hon. Gentleman, who has been very quiet, although I do so in fear and trepidation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Webb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, the Government cannot know precisely what the take-up rate will be. However, there public expenditure projection for the next three years must include a take-up assumption, otherwise they could not have arrived at a figure for the number of claimants. What take-up assumption underlines the Government's actual public expenditure projection?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will know—indeed, he has said as much—that the extra £1.5 billion is a generous figure that consists partly of the extra take-up. He argued on the Floor of the House that he would choose to spend the £1.5 billion differently, and I know that he has done a great deal of research on the matter.<br><br>
Because they will be sent reminders, those who are already claiming will receive the money. We must then make a reasonable projection of the subsequent take-up, and set money aside. As the hon. Gentleman knows, that inexact science depends on issues such as public awareness. Assessing take-up is a matter of estimating potential, particularly with regard to child care tax credit. We have made it clear that we expect expenditure to be in the region of £250 million. However, without a crystal ball, it is impossible to say now precisely what will happen, and it would be foolish of me to try to do so.<br><br>
The discussion has centred on whether the word, "tax" should be removed from the clause. I have dealt with incentives to work and ensuring that work pays. The Government want to deal with the problem of working families who are trapped in the poverty or unemployment trap, as did the previous Government. Working families tax credit is designed to ensure that the main obstacles faced by those families—unemployment, poverty and the lack of affordable child care—are tackled.<br><br>
It is not surprising that hon. Members can see similarities with family credit. We have used the best aspects of family credit, built on it and improved it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Paymaster General give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman for the last time and then I would like to finish my remarks on the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Paymaster General said that the aim was to help families in the unemployment and poverty traps. However, the poverty trap is occupied by those who are earning but have no real incentive to better themselves, and the Paymaster General has used the word "taper" only once or twice in her remarks so far. She has not looked at the arithmetic at all.<br><br>
Several Opposition Members have put heavy emphasis on the combined taper of income tax, national insurance, housing benefit, council tax benefit and now, working families tax credit. The latter has exactly the same defects
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0395">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 67</span>
as family credit, but it extends much further up the income scale. Far from less people being caught in the poverty trap, more families will be caught in it. When will the Paymaster General deal with the arithmetic of the taper? The Government have been very coy about letting us have the relevant figures.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That does not relate to this amendment, which proposes that we take out the word "tax". As the hon. Gentleman knows, the taper in the working families tax credit is considerably lower than the taper that operates in family credit. He will no doubt want to make his point again when we reach the relevant point in our discussion.<br><br>
The word "tax" creates the link with the tax system and the pay packet. That is the radical change that the Government seek to make. It demonstrates the reward of work and underlines the incentive for people to work, earn more and keep more. Clearly a stigma is associated with claiming benefits, which we are seeking to tackle. I understand that hon. Members will want to ensure that that stigma is not attached to those who claim their rights, whether in the tax or benefits system. We believe that that stigma can be tackled by providing benefit in the pay packet and rewarding work with a tax credit. By removing the word "tax", hon. Members would break that link, distort that view and remove that incentive.<br><br>
Opposition Members will not be surprised to hear that we will resist their amendment. By using the tax system, which will provide a tax credit through the wage packet, reinforce work, assist families in work with the more generous disregard and the taper, and provide the option of claiming the child care tax credit, we will make that shift of perception and assist in solving the problems that all Committee members have identified—the poverty trap and the unemployment trap. I am sure that hon. Members will follow the progress of the working families tax credit vigorously to ensure that incentives are firmly in place and that they work as the Government expect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make a few brief remarks. The amendments stem in some respects from an intervention that I made on the Paymaster General on Second Reading. I do not mean this disrespectfully, but she did not seem to understand my point. I said that the Bill does not introduce a tax credit—it may be called that, but that is not what it is.<br><br>
I can do no better than to quote a Chartered Institute of Taxation document, which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Despite the name, the extent to which the proposed credits will be integrated with the current tax system as it affects employers is very limited."</p></blockquote>
It goes on to state:
<br><blockquote><p>"there is to be no direct link between the PAYE tax for the period or the pay on which it is based, and the amount of the credits paid out to the employee."</p></blockquote>
The matter might be better summed up by an excellent book that was posted to me by its author, Mr. A. J. Carroll. It was probably the first thing that the Paymaster General chose to read on receiving her new appointment. The book is up to date, and deals with whether the Government are introducing a tax credit. It states that the Contributions Agency
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 68</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"was outmanoeuvred by the professionals: in 1998 the Inland Revenue staged a successful takeover, brandishing the weapons of greater efficiency and cost savings.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>As in most revolutions, the defeated did not disappear, but survive as moles within the Revenue structure. They are involved in the wily plot to re-label benefits as 'Working Families Tax Credits'. In reality WFTCs have nothing to do with tax at all, but are simply handouts masquerading as tax reliefs. They are part of a dastardly plan hatched by ex-DSS officers to make people work for their benefits instead of child-minding, cooking, cleaning and watching daytime TV."</p></blockquote>
Those are the author's words, not mine. It is clear, however, that the Bill involves not tax credits, but a mechanism that will deliver benefits in a much more difficult way. While I assure the Whips' Office that the Opposition do not intend habitually to divide the Committee, I shall seek to press the amendment to a vote because it deals with a matter of principle.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before we come to amendment No. 26, I should tell the Committee that, although it is unusual to appear to go backwards in consideration of amendments, it is procedurally perfectly proper to do so. As <i>Erskine May</i> states on page 524:
<br><blockquote><p>"if an amendment is withdrawn or negatived"—</p></blockquote>
as was amendment No. 1—
<br><blockquote><p>"it is open to the committee, subject to the Chairman's selection, to entertain amendments back to the point at which it last came to a decision."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 26, in page 1, line 7, leave out 'families' and insert 'families".<br><br>
I do not believe that the amendment will be an issue at the next general election. Nevertheless, it is worth tabling it to raise the subject of the wording of the working families tax credit. It does not have an apostrophe after the final "s", whereas the disabled person's tax credit has an apostrophe. It would be helpful if the Paymaster General dealt with the grammatical phrasing of the tax credit.</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am stunned that hon. Members are not all rushing to speak to the amendment, which is curious because it is partial—it deals with only one missing apostrophe. To prove to the Committee that I am

not an unreasonable person, if the hon. Gentleman withdraws his amendment, I undertake to ensure that, on reprinting, the Bill is corrected throughout, rather than only in one place that the hon. Gentleman suggests. It is unusual for amendments to concern punctuation, but none the less, I am grateful for the official Opposition's assistance in the matter, and we will restore the apostrophe to its rightful place.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Lait</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It gives me pleasure to speak to the amendments and the new clause. In a sense, this is a continuation of our previous debates, given the number of times that we have mentioned the child care tax credit. It is an integral part of the Bill but—surprise, surprise—nowhere does it appear in the wording. The primary purpose of the amendments and the new clause is to include in the Bill reference to that crucial part of the working families tax credit.<br><br>
The Bill does not contain a huge number of clauses, but it is not terribly easy for people who do not understand legislative wording to know what it is all about. Therefore, in the spirit of helpfulness, we invite the Government to accept the amendment, to make it clearer to the outside world exactly what the Bill means. I hope that we will get a positive response of grateful thanks from the Government for our suggestion.<br><br>
Child care is a crucial part of what the Government are trying to achieve with their working families tax credit. It is potentially an expensive part of that credit. We were not able in previous debates to entice the Paymaster General into giving us any estimate of how many people she expects to claim the benefit in the next few years. As I said earlier, we are concerned that people will arrange their affairs to maximise their income. Part of that will be to arrange their child care costs accordingly.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 70</span>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury said, the taper has been increased to a much higher level of withdrawal—we discovered from parliamentary questions that it could go up as high as £37,000. As the Paymaster General implied in the answer—I do not suggest anything underhand in that—not many families have an income of £37,000 and five children. However, a number of families earn enough to be paying 40 per cent. taxation and have children, so they will be eligible for this benefit. I can imagine all those families—who are the ones most likely to have an accountant's advice—altering their child care arrangements to ensure that they maximise their tax position. As far as they are concerned, that is the sensible, laudable and right thing to do.<br><br>
Then there are those further down the income scale whom the Government say, rightly, they are trying to help. It is my firm belief and contention that they too will alter their arrangements to ensure maximum access to child care tax credit. The hon. Lady said that she did not expect many people to change their informal child care arrangements. I am sure that she says that with the best of intentions and that many people would not wish to change them because, as the hon. Lady said, they suit them. However, the Bill will in effect allow those people to formalise those arrangements.<br><br>
For example, mum, aunt or a neighbour might be looking after the children. That is an informal child care arrangement, with which most of us have no problem. It is probably one of the most effective and loving situations in which child care can be offered to a family. However, given the incentives that are built into the Bill, such informal arrangements are likely to be formalised as result of those people registering as child minders. That will lead to a huge increase in the number of registered child minders—there would need to be an increase in registration to meet the provisions of the Children Act 1989, so that children between the ages of eight and 14, or 16 if they are disabled, can go home after school or to their next-door neighbour, granny, auntie or whoever to be looked after. Not everyone wants to go to homework clubs or take up the variety of other suggestions that the Government have come up with Not only will the Children Act need to be amended accordingly, so that children get proper care, but that is a further incentive for grannies, aunties and whoever to register as child minders.<br><br>
There will therefore be an explosion in the number of child minders. Local authorities will find it difficult to register and inspect them—they will certainly need more money to do so. Those people will be able, rightly, to claim child care tax credit. I do not have a problem with that. Indeed, it will bring yet more people into the formal employment network, which I am sure that all hon. Members on both sides would support.<br><br>
When I represented Hastings and Rye, I remember urging various people that it could be a logical step for them to register as child minders under the child care disregard and family credit which existed when we were in Government. The child care tax credit makes that even more logical and sensible.<br><br>
As well as a huge explosion in the number of formal, registered child minders, I submit that there will also be an explosion in demand for the child care tax credit to pay for those child minders who register. I have no

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 71</span>
objection to that. Conservative Members accept that people behave as logical economic beings and that that is what they should be doing. Whether we approve of the consequences is another matter. The Government clearly have not taken on board the costs that are involved. They have also chosen to ignore the consequences to the ordinary taxpayer, who will pay 40 per cent. tax—yet another hidden tax from the Government—with none hand and get it back with the other. The usual costly administrative chaos approaches.<br><br>
Given the scope of the Bill, this is the Committee's only opportunity, to discuss child care tax credit and the problems surrounding it. The tax credit will be available to two parents who are working and, in particular, to single parents. It will be more difficult for the traditional family, in which the mother is usually at home looking after the children, to claim child care tax credit. I suspect that such families, if they wish their children to have access to the sort of child care that is developing, will organise their affairs so that they are able to claim.<br><br>
Yet again, the Government are further reinforcing their desire for the strengthening of an a typical family pattern. That is not the traditional pattern, where the mother stays at home and looks after the children—certainly, at least, when they are under the age of five. The measure represents even more pressure to get both parents working and, rightly, gives further encouragement to single parents to go out to work. However, it makes single parenthood more attractive, which Conservative Members find problematic.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Webb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady mentioned the traditional family and the incentive for it to adjust its affairs. I am unclear as to whether the mother in her example could register as a child minder and be paid by the father, through a contract, to bring up their children. Does the hon. Lady believe that they would be eligible for child care tax credit?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Lait</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an option that I had not considered. It is a reasonable point and one that is worth exploring. I hope that the Paymaster General will be able to clarify the siltation. I may be wrong, but I do not believe that we have yet seen the relevant regulations—[<i>Interruption.</i>] I see that I am wrong. I am sorry—I have not been able to get a cold towel around my head to read that part. Will the hon. Lady tell the Committee whether a mother could register as a child minder and claim working families tax credit for her children? That is an interesting wrinkle that we had not considered. It is well worth getting an answer to the question. I shall be happy to wait until later for it.<br><br>
The Paymaster General said that the regulatory impact assessment will not come into play until we reach clause 5. The impact assessment in my possession states, on page 10:
<br><blockquote><p>"The figure in Table 3"—</p></blockquote>
it is not necessary to quote them at this stage—
<br><blockquote><p>"do not include any estimates for the additional costs arising for the childcare industry from having to deal with the verification of claims to childcare tax credit".</p></blockquote>
As this is the only opportunity that the Committee will have to debate child care tax credit, will the Paymaster General tell us whether she is doing any further work on the matter?<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 72</span>
If my argument is correct and there is a huge increase in child care provision, it will be an issue for those who become part of the industry—that is quite apart from the present nature of the industry. Inevitably, there are a lot of small businesses, many of which involve only one person. Several nursery schools are part of chains and fall into the larger employer category. Those chains will, however, probably employ people who have the right to claim WFTC and CCTC. They will, therefore, face a heavy regulatory burden. So, too, will small businesses and the country's many child minders. They will have to cope with local authority registration and inspection systems that are not the easiest. Claims are made throughout the country of different standards of inspection. We will probably have to issue national guidelines. Local authorities will have to employ more people. People who register as child minders will have to come to terms with a lot of bureaucracy. They will face the continuing costs that arise from collecting and verifying claims for child care.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
It would be helpful if the Paymaster General could advise us as to whether the child care industry is being consulted on how much it thinks that the provisions will cost as that will come into our debates later. It is mind-boggling that the draft passed it over so lightly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Collins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that it would be helpful if the Paymaster General reconciled her remarks with the Prime Minister's comments in a speech earlier this week in Bristol? He accepted that excessive regulation destroyed jobs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Lait</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I very much hope that the Paymaster General will do so. It is clear from my consultations with local businesses that red tape and bureaucracy have taken over as the No. 1 concern in business. I am afraid that, for many reasons, the working family tax credit will impact dramatically on businesses' perceptions. Many of them do not realise what will happen to them and how quickly. Indeed, I talked this week to representatives of a large company that employs and does business with many women. I briefly explained how the provisions would work and a senior person from that business paled visibly. The same happened when my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove talked to her jeweller. That business man will have to grapple with the paperwork that goes with all the measures that the Government have introduced. The thought of yet another level of bureaucracy was clearly a great concern.<br><br>
I want to draw my remarks to a close and I hope that I have raised most of our concerns about the child care tax credit, although I am sure that my hon. Friends will want to contribute. However, I want to raise a point that I made on Second Reading. It comes entirely from my experience of the Child Support Agency, which I am sure that many hon. Members who were here in the previous Session of Parliament share. I promise that my point is in order, Mrs. Roe—I am sure that you will pull me up if it is not.<br><br>
Because of my experience with the Child Support Agency I seek, through new clause 9, to amend the way in which the child care tax credit is paid. I want to take
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0398">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 73</span>
account of the situation in which two parents with shared care do not live together. Many of us entirely support the principle behind the Child Support Agency. However, I encountered several big and distressing issues when dealing with problems that arose with the agency. One was that of two parents who do not live together but share the care of the children. Quite legitimately, the parent who looked after the children for the shorter period—usually the father—claimed a reduction in maintenance payments to the mother.<br><br>
Given that I believe that people are rational economic human beings and given the value of the child care tax credit, in cases where care of children is shared, has the Paymaster General given any thought to the problem of claims that will inevitably arise for a share of the child care tax credit? If a father is looking after the children for just one third of the year—which is broadly the qualification for the Child Support Agency definition of shared care—he could legitimately also claim for a share of the child care tax credit. It is up to the mother and father to decide how those children are looked after, and we all know the infinite variety that exists when it comes to family structures and looking after children.<br><br>
I am assuming that the Treasury and the Paymaster General have considered that important point, but there has been no comment on it so far. Will there be any flexibility in the way in which the child care tax credit is paid? I suspect that without flexibility heaven forfend that we get into the same administrative nightmare that we did with the Child Support Agency—we shall reinforce some of the problems about maintenance of children and antagonism between parents. People will come into our surgeries demanding what they see as a fair share of the tax credit. The Treasury will have to think again and work out some way of sharing the tax credit between both parents.<br><br>
This is our only opportunity so far to debate the child care tax credit, although our ingenuity may well provide us with some more. It is a crucial part of the working families tax credit and I very much hope that, as this is one of their key policies, the Government will recognise that it would be sensible to put the child care tax credit on the face of the Bill. Then at least they can take the credit for introducing a benefit of which they are proud.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Webb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to take the opportunity to make one or two brief remarks about the amendments. The hon. Member for Beckenham has obviously thought deeply about these issues and is right to bring them to the Committee's attention. To the extent that amendments Nos. 20, 21 and 22 are facilitating measures that enable us to table other amendments about the child care tax credit, I warmly welcome them.<br><br>
In passing, Mrs. Roe, I apologise for the absence of my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable). I have had a note saying that he is at home in bed with flu and asking that his apologies be conveyed to the Committee.<br><br>
I have reservations about the practicality of what is proposed in new clause 9. I understand the hon. Lady's point. One can envisage a situation in which a couple are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 74</span>
separated and the child spends weekends or holidays with one parent and week days with the other, or some days in the week with one and some with the other.<br><br>
New clause 9 proposed that the child care tax credit, if paid to one parent, would be available pro rata to the other. Surely that is not necessary, because my understanding is that if the parents are not living together they are potentially separately eligible to claim working families tax credit. If each of them were spending money on child care, that could be factored into their claim for the working families tax credit. My presumption is that if both are on a low income separately—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Lait</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the hon. Gentleman's thinking and would not disagree with it, but I am fascinated that he seems to be suggesting either that two parents will share the same working family tax credit or a doubling of the cost. Will he comment on that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Webb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am certainly not suggesting that two parents would share the tax credit. Without new clause 9 and if both parties were on a particularly low wage, both would be able to claim working families tax credit, providing that they are receiving a share of the child benefit, because that is the eligibility rule. There could be two children in the family, one living with one parent and one living with the other. A simpler mechanism might be for each party to make independent claims based on their actual income. They would not be assessed as a joint benefit unit if they were not living together, but trying to work out how much of the total was related to child care tax credit and who was spending what in which week on how many nights a week seems to be fiendishly complicated.<br><br>
The hon. Lady is trying to tackle a genuine problem in an increasingly common situation. The original proposal may be necessary and I have a nasty feeling that the subsequent proposal might be even messier.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Lait</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let us hope that the Paymaster General can clarify the matter for us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Webb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On that upbeat note, I hope that the Paymaster General will also respond to whether mothers can register as child carers and for child care, and under what circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may deal with that point first. The answer is, no, it will not be possible. The draft regulations that we exposed on Monday show that we are building on the rules for child care disregard in family credit. The existing family credit rules prevent the child care disregard from being used in the way described in the scenario in which a father pays a mother for looking after their children.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Beckenham also referred to page 10 of the impact assessment and the costs on the child care industry in paragraph 46. The costs are not dealt with in the table because the calculations are extremely difficult to make with any certainty. The hon. Lady will see that paragraph 46 makes it clear that the figures fall within approximately 5 per cent. of the recurrent and non-recurrent costs. The figure is mentioned there because
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0399">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 75</span>
it is the best estimate of the likely costs if proof was required that the payment had been made. I know that the hon. Lady supports that.<br><br>
The hon. Lady's amendment is unnecessary and would be horrendously complicated. Opposition Members have spoken at length about the need not to create problems under the Bill—for example the problem of those who might make less-than-honest applications. The Bill provides the power to make regulations covering the scheme for the WFTC and the DPTC. The provisions of the child care tax credit are included in those regulations; they are part of the overall scheme. The child care tax credit is an integral part of the WFTC and the DPTC. The credit will provide extra help to cover child care costs for people receiving those two tax credits. The draft regulations show the structure of the child care tax credit an dhow it fits in with the WFTC and the DPTC. Therefore, the points raised by the hon. Lady are unnecessary.<br><br>
New clause 9 proposes that if child care tax credit is paid for a child whose parents are living apart, it should be split proportionately between them. I remind the Committee of a few basic facts about working families tax credit. It will be paid to family units to help low-income families with children. The level of the award will be calculated on the basis of total household income, which was, I think, the point made by the hon. Member for Northavon. Child care tax credit will be awarded if, having qualified for WFTC, families are paying eligible child costs. Clearly, one set of child care costs should not be calculated twice in two separate claims.<br><br>
11.15 am<br><br>
Working families tax credit is awarded where the applicant has responsibility for the children as members of the household. The regulations provide that when a child spends time in different households, parents can decide who receives the payments, but it cannot be split. Child care tax credit is part of the WFTC and is awarded only when a parent qualifies. A parent must qualify on income to receive WFTC.<br><br>
The new clause would split the WFTC package, giving rise to an impossible situation. It would not even produce a pick-and-mix bag of measures, it would cause chaos. What the regulations propose is clear. I have dealt with the hon. Lady's points on the parent with responsible care. Parents can choose who receives the credit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Paymaster General comment on the cost of child care tax credit, in particular the discrepancy between the Government's estimate of £200 million and the IFS's estimate of £4 billion? In its evidence to the Social Security Committee, the Inland Revenue said that the £200 million is based essentially on estimates of the extent to which people would move into paid child care. It is clear that the Government have made some calculations. Will the hon. Lady provide those estimates—how many people will move into paid child care and on what assumptions are those estimates based? What figure will be inserted into the blank in regulation 12 on the disregard for weekly maintenance payments? The figure was 15, now there will be a blank.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 76</span>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I dealt with the IFS estimate of £4 billion in the previous debate. It was based on the assumption that everyone would move from informal to formal, registered child care. As for the blank, the figure will be a 100 per cent. disregard for the CSA.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Webb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Paymaster General has taken me aback by saying that the disregard will be 100 per cent. Will she clarify that for the record? I understand that the regulations refer to the current rate, which allows £15 of maintenance to be disregarded in the calculation of family credit. Is she saying that all maintenance paid will be disregarded under WFTC? I am grateful that she dealt with whether a mother could be the approved child carer. Is that the only exemption? Can a grandmother, sister or aunt register? Are mothers the only relatives to be ruled out?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, the person has to be engaged in a business, registered for childminding under the terms of the Children Act and fall within the eligibility criteria for family credit. Secondly, I am happy to confirm that for the purposes of the WFTC there will be a disregard of 100 per cent. of any maintenance that is paid as a result of the CSA's intervention. That standard is used in the tax system and it is another way of showing the difference between the WFTC and the family credit benefit. It should also reinforce the work incentive.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Paymaster General said that she had dealt with the difference between the Government's figures and those of the IFS. She has done, but only to some extent, not completely. There is still a piece missing from the jigsaw and having it would speed up our deliberations. This is the key question: is there anything to prevent those in informal child care from registering as childminders?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The rules for our proposed system are the same as those that apply to family credit benefit. Those people could not register under family credit benefit and they should not be able to do so under the WFTC, because the two benefits use the same eligibility criteria. The question is, could a mother be paid by a father to care for their own children? The answer is no. If the hon. Gentleman is making a different point that I have overlooked, I hope that he will write to me so that I can deal with it. The eligibility criteria are the same for both benefits. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that such people could register under family credit benefit? If so, he should give some examples.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Paymaster General should examine the IFS's comments on the matter. She has not helped the situation very much. She said earlier this morning, "We will take the family credit benefit, and extend and build on it." She also said—and I am certain that my recollection is correct—that one of the key elements of that extension is the child care tax credit. She cannot say one thing at roughly 10.30 am and something quite different at 11.22 am. The incentives will be greater under the Government's proposed system and, as she eloquently pointed out, its regime will be different. Why does she
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0400">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 77</span>
think that the current criteria will prevent those who are currently engaged in more informal child care from registering?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The simple answer is that the rules will prevent it. The eligibility criteria, in combination with the provisions of the Children Act 1989, state that paid child care, which includes a childminder or an out-of-school club, has to be involved. The rules for family credit are also tight in this context. It is the rules about who qualifies that matter, not the incentives. If people think that they can fiddle the system, they are sorely mistaken.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to pursue that point. The Paymaster General will recall that the Select Committee on Social Security met officials from the Inland Revenue, who suggested exactly the opposite. They said that it would be "permissible".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What would be permissible?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 78</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To register. The officials said that there was nothing to prevent that. I press this matter not to embarrass the Paymaster General but because it is the key question. The Children Act 1989 says one thing, but experts in taxation gave the Select Committee on Social Security straightforward advice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They have to register and to comply with the registration criteria, which are contained in the provisions relating to family credit benefit and to WFTC. Under both sets of criteria a wife could not register for a husband to pay her to look after their children. I have now answered that question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have a further point to put to the Paymaster General—</span></p>
