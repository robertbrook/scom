I apologise to the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel) for interrupting, but some members of the public have now arrived and it seems unreasonable and unfair to place them at the end of such a vast Room, as they will have difficulty in following the proceedings. That is not how Parliament should treat the people who send us here. Would it be possible to ask the Serjeant at Arms to produce the rope that he produced at an earlier sitting, so that the Bar can be moved closer to the Committee? That would allow the public to move forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We cannot disrupt our proceedings now, but inquiries will be made about an alteration for our sitting this afternoon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rendel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall ensure that my voice is heard even in the far corners of the Room.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 4 deals with the inspection that may be required of the premises of firms that are, or should be, setting up pension schemes. That was discussed at our previous sitting, and concern has been expressed on both sides of the Committee about the level of expenditure that may be needed for businesses—particularly small businesses—to comply with the terms of the provision. We have tabled our first probing amendment to ask the Government to discuss in greater detail the exposure to cost that businesses may face as a result of the inspections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 26 and 27 in my name and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten) are closely linked. I feel no need to speak to them separately, so I shall discuss them together. They are probing amendments and if they receive a satisfactory response from the Minister I shall ask the Committee for permission to withdraw amendment No. 26. I want to know how the Government expect the inspectorate to work, what difficulties they expect businesses to face as a result of the inspections, what costs those businesses will face, and how they may best be able to reduce the necessary expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is considerable worry that, if the inspections are draconian, they may prove over-burdensome to the businesses concerned. We do not want that to happen. However, what often happens in such cases is that the inspection powers may initially be over-burdensome while the inspectors are finding out how best to carry out their inspections, what action they need to take, and how long they need to spend on the inspections. For that reason, we propose that the Government should consider a review of the inspection powers after a year, and annually thereafter. The Government would thus have the opportunity to assess whether the inspection powers are causing problems for businesses, whether all the powers that inspectors are given are necessary, and whether those powers are being used in a way that causes unnecessary problems. An annual review would give us the opportunity to assess regularly how the powers are being used and whether we could relieve businesses of some of the unnecessary burdens that they might otherwise face.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should explain in greater detail how they expect the inspections to be carried out, what sort of burdens they expect to impose on businesses and how those burdens could best be reduced. Do they accept that the inspectors' powers should be reviewed annually?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak to the amendments that stand in my name and the names of my colleagues—amendments Nos. 15 and 33.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have previously discussed the additional—and in some cases gratuitous—burdens that stakeholder pensions will place on employers. In that connection, I made a strong case that was not refuted by the Government. There is a danger that the need for small employers to provide a stakeholder pension may be a disincentive to taking on their first few employees, which would be a perverse and sad consequence. The Government gave an assurance that the regulations that they will make under powers that are contained in the Bill will establish a threshold relating to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0586">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>211</span>
the number of employees below which the obligation to provide a stakeholder pension will not apply. I greatly welcome that valuable concession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the specialised burden on employers of inspections, which are contained in clause 4. We all know that we currently have an extremely interfering, nannying and over-regulating Government. Businesses in my constituency increasingly complain about that. Although they complained about the burden of excessive Government regulation under the previous Administration, they all say that a bad situation has become a great deal worse over the past two years, and that they do not want it to go on. One of the many burdens faced by employers is that of inspections that are carried out by bureaucrats operating on behalf of central or local government, or on behalf of one of the agencies. The Inland Revenue the Contributions Agency, and Customs and Excise have the power to carry out inspections, and they regularly do so. Traditionally, Customs and Excise have extremely intrusive powers to search without a warrant, which is a power to which they are very attached. Those inspections cause great problems for businesses—they hold up their operation and take up the management's time. Businesses are also increasingly at the mercy of other forms of inspection, such as those made by health and safety and environmental inspectors. A vast number of people in this country earn their living by inspecting others, not by contributing to the gross domestic product. The nanny state is built by stealth. It is much easier to bring forward new ideas for regulation than it is to take a stand against creeping bureaucracy and regulation. We live in an over-regulated society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is almost making a clause stand part speech. This is a very narrow amendment and I should be grateful if he would stay within its confines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The object of the two amendments is to place some restrictions, and therefore some discipline, on inspections. There are circumstances in which the financial services regulators—whether they be the Financial Services Authority or the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority—will need to inspect businesses, but the bureaucracy should not indulge in vast empire-building. The job of its teams of inspectors is simply to inspect: it is not their job to disrupt the operations of people who are conducting their business correctly and reasonably, and about whom there is no suspicion of wrongdoing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mark Oaten 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Winchester)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that a good company, which is putting in place good practice, would welcome an inspection process? It would be encouraged that the bad practice of some of its competitors was being inspected in a proper and robust way. Surely the Government's suggestion should be welcomed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman. It is important that those who are not conducting their business properly and about whom there is some suspicion about
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>212</span>
the integrity or efficiency of their pension arrangements should be open to inspection. If the hon. Gentleman does me the compliment of reading amendment No. 33, he will see that it would ensure that people who are the subject of inspections are people about whom there is reasonable suspicion that things are not as they should be or that the employer concerned has behaved unreasonably by not answering written inquiries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The object of the two amendments is to establish that if undue costs are imposed on employers by virtue of the inspection, the regulator will have to meet those costs. Clearly, as a matter of common law, the regulator would not have to meet those costs if he discovered that an abuse was taking place. But if a burden is placed on an innocent business for no good reason, the regulator should pay, which is the purpose of amendment No. 15.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When inspectors visit premises and delay matters or make unreasonable demands—for example, by involving actuaries or accountants—which cause a firm to run up expenses, and then discover that there is nothing wrong with the way in which the firm has been running its stakeholder pension scheme, the regulator would be held to account. All bureaucracies have their own budgets within which their employees are supposed to stay. A real sanction would be to make the regulatory body aware that undue costs that are imposed on an innocent employer would be to the account of the regulator. To avoid de minimis issues, amendment No. 15 provides for a cost of more than £100 to fall on the regulator.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 33 is even more important. It goes to the heart of the rationale of the inspections. Clause 4 is widely drafted by a bureaucrat who wants to give himself and his colleagues the widest possible scope for carrying out inspections of everyone at all times and for any particular purpose, and to go on a fishing expedition, which will, no doubt, incur expenses. That is not good enough. It is elementary that an inspection should not take place unless there are grounds for it. If an inspector wants to find out whether a pension scheme is being run properly, he should first write a letter and ask questions, to which the employer should respond within 30 days. Failure to do so would be unreasonable and, in such a circumstance, amendment No. 33 would enable inspection to take place. If unsatisfactory answers were given or if, through other means, prima facie evidence of abuse came to light, inspection could then take place regardless of the 30-day limit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, in the event of serious misbehaviour, the regulator must be empowered to carry out a dawn raid to seize evidence and he would retain that power under the amendment. In such a circumstance, it would be a complete defence for the regulator to plead that the inspection was conducted on the basis of prima facie evidence held in good faith.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kali Mountford 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Colne Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening to the hon. Gentleman's thesis. Is he saying that inspections should take place only after an apparent misdeed has been committed? Would not it be sensible instead to carry out inspections to prevent the committing of misdeeds?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0587">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>213</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should be grateful to the hon. Lady for one of the most revealing interventions so far. She spoke from the heart and put forward in a few lucid sentences the new Labour philosophy of the nanny state, which argues that to prevent someone doing something wrong on a particular day, the whole country should be subject to regular inspection by bureaucrats. Clearly, she believes that the Government should run a kindergarten state, although I doubt whether even kindergartens are run in that way. When one thinks about it—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That was an interesting diversion, which I allowed to continue for a moment or two. We must now return to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was responding to the broad point, Mr. Malins. I leave it to your imagination and the imaginations of Committee members as to how that principle would work. In every walk of life, honest and honourable people going about their daily business would be inspected to prevent their doing something wrong. I shall move on, but there was something distinctly Orwellian about the intervention by the hon. Member for Colne Valley (Kali Mountford). I recognise that Labour Committee members are sincere democrats who do not want an horrific, totalitarian state—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sure that all Committee members are democrats. We must stay within the terms of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Colne Caley has in any case made my point. We must prune in the bud the tendencies that she expressed so graphically. We must ensure that powers of inspection are not abused or used excessively onerously. Such powers should be the exception not the rule, and should be held in reserve. They should be used only when exceptional interventions are warranted. Inspectors should not look over the shoulders of every honest working man and woman in the hope—I am almost inclined to say—that they can spot mistakes and claim credit for their correction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would define more sharply the powers that the clause will grant to inspectors. First, those who conduct inspections without reasonable grounds and who impose burdens and costs on the inspected, would have to pay. That is a useful principle that could be widely applied elsewhere. Secondly, there must be prima facie evidence of abuse or unreasonable behaviour and/or failure to answer questions in writing, and the inspection must be the second or third stage, not the first stage, as it appears to be in the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gainsborough)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can understand why the Government felt that the clause was necessary. There must be comeback to force employers who are not prepared to fulfil their statutory duties to do so, whether we agree with those duties or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 26 and 27 tabled by our Liberal Democrat colleagues and amendment No. 33 in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies) are sensible because they give the Secretary of State flexibility to keep the powers under
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>214</span>
review. Amendment No. 33 in particular is a fall-back position. It is common ground between both sides of the Committee that we do not want to impose undue burdens on business. Therefore, an inspection should take place only when an employer has failed, as the amendment says,
	<br><q><p>"within 30 days to give satisfactory responses to written enquiries".</p></q>
I am sure that the Minister will say that it is not a new power. In the light of the amendments, what is contained in similar legislation? I look up the explanatory notes that the Government have helpfully provided and I see that under section 99 of the Pensions Act 1995, OPRA is given power to inspect documents. Is that power on all fours with the power in the clause? Is it a similar sort of regulatory burden?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause involves a major new undertaking for a small employer. Given the Government's majority, clearly they will have their will and the clause will stand part of the Bill. How does the Minister see it operating on the ground with small employers? They already have to cope with the increased burden of the working families tax credit and, as they have always done, with national insurance contributions and the minimum wage. Whatever one's views on the minimum wage, one could argue that those duties are relatively simple for the employer to cope with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we go back to clause 3 for an explanation of employer's duties, the explanatory notes, for which again I am grateful, say:
	<br><q><p>"the employer must allow the scheme 'reasonable access' to the relevant employees … What is 'reasonable' is likely to vary according to the nature and size of the employer's business, but this could involve the holding of workplace meetings or the distribution of information through pay packets."</p></q>
That is why I am worried about the provision and why I think that we need further information from the Minister ron how he thinks a very small employer will be able to cope with a burden of that sort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency very few employers employ more than 50 or 100 people, apart from the public sector. The majority employ perhaps half a dozen people, or even fewer. Employers will not merely have to comply with the clause, which may include visits to their premises when they have apparently done nothing wrong. Amendment No. 33 is relevant here, because it will lock into place only when the employer has been unreasonable in complying with his statutory duties. To avoid the threat that the authorities can come in and look at all the employer's documentation, a very small employer—a small farmer, for instance—will apparently have to have
	<br><q><p>"workplace meetings or the distribution of information through pay packets."</p></q>
Then, according to the explanatory note on subsection (5),
	<br><q><p>"the employer must deduct the employee's contributions from his wages and pay them to the chosen scheme".</p></q>
To be fair, the Minister makes it clear in the explanatory notes that the intention is to strike a balance between the cost to the employer and flexibility to the member. There is also a regulation-making power to prescribe restrictions on that requirement. If the Minister is telling us that that does not place an undue burden on business, this may be an opportunity for him to explain to the Committee why he thinks that my honourable Friend's amendment is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0588">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>215</span>
unnecessary, and that authorities will not climb over employers and their documentation and go through their filing systems. As is set out in clause 3 (5) and in the explanatory notes, the Minister will have a
	<br><q><p>"regulation-making power to prescribe restrictions on this requirement."</p></q>
It also says in the explanatory notes that,
	<br><q><p>"There will be consultation, for example, on the establishment of a clearing house to receive contributions. If a clearing house were established, this power could be used to enable employers to pass contributions to it rather than direct to schemes".</p></q>
If the Minister thinks that the amendments are unnecessary, it is incumbent on him to explain to the Committee exactly how the clearing house will be used to help very small employers to cope with the regulatory burdens that are undoubtedly being imposed on them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security (Mr. Stephen Timms)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, may I welcome you back to presiding over our proceedings this morning, Mr. Malins, in this rather splendid Committee Room?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the outset, I should respond to a couple of points made by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford. The Government are committed to lifting the burdens on business, many of which were imposed by the previous Administration. It is ironic that, only two or three weeks ago, we were in this Committee Room debating the proposed transfer of the Contributions Agency from the Department of Social Security to the Inland Revenue. As the shadow Chancellor rightly said, that is a significant step towards reducing the burdens on business. He opposed that significant deregulatory move. Fortunately, the Opposition were unsuccessful on that occasion and that Bill has now received Royal Assent. The Government have a very good record in that regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman suggested that I had given a commitment during our previous sitting to incorporate an exclusion for employers from the access requirements to stakeholder pensions based on the number of employees. I did not actually say that. I said that we would seek to minimise the impact on business of that requirement. At column 193, I made the point that the case for excluding very small employers with one or two employees is a great deal stronger than the case that he advanced for excluding those with nine employees. I said that the issue would be resolved through further consultation, but I do not want to give him or the Committee the impression that I went further than that in my remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a serious matter because it goes to the heart of how our proceedings ought to be conducted. When the Minister made the remarks to which he has just referred, I assumed that the Government accepted the principle that there should be some exclusion. However, his remarks made it clear that the Government had not decided when that exclusion should apply—to employers with two, four or six employees. We cannot proceed on the basis that the Government say that but do not mean it at all. Those remarks have no meaning if the Government do not propose to use regulations to provide an exclusion for employers with a very small number of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>216</span>
employees. I shall be extraordinarily disappointed if the Government do not provide for that, and will feel short-changed if the regulations do not reflect our clear understanding of what the Minister said at the previous sitting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can only refer the hon. Gentleman to what I said in the previous sitting. At column 193, I made the point that the case for an organisation employing one person is much stronger than that for an organisation employing nine people. The question of where the barrier should fall will be resolved by consultation. I understand that the Government were not committed to where the barrier should fall, but that they were committed to having a barrier. The sentence that the Minister read out clarifies the matter for the whole Committee—there can be no other interpretation of it than that the principle of the barrier has been accepted. We are simply arguing about where the barrier should fall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am reminded of Bernard Shaw and the actress. The principle has been conceded; it is now a question of degree. That is how the matter was left, and I hope that the hon. gentleman will not undermine the atmosphere of mutual trust that exists in this Committee by telling us retrospectively that his remarks should not be interpreted in accordance with the normal use of the English language.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to reaffirm what I said. I simply want to ensure that hon. Members do not read more into what I said than was there to be inferred. The matter will be resolved in the consultation process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to respond to all three of the speeches that were made on the four amendments together, as they all related to OPRA's powers to investigate compliance. I shall begin by explaining why we need the provisions that are set out in clause 4. We need them to underpin the obligations on employers to provide access to the stakeholder pension schemes under the previous clause. The requirements will significantly improve access to second pensions and will help stakeholder pension schemes to deliver better value than most currently available personal pensions. They therefore form a key element of our proposals for encouraging many more people to save for their retirement. Clause 4 provides support by giving OPRA powers to investigate employers' compliance with their obligations under clause 3.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 4 does not provide a new type of power. I can confirm the suspicion of the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh). OPRA already has similar powers to investigate whether certain regulatory provisions of the Pensions Act 1995 are being complied with. The powers in respect of occupational schemes that are outlined here are—to use the hon. Gentleman's expression—"on all fours" with those in the 1995 Act. Clause 4 mirrors those provisions and extends them to the employer access requirements in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister explain how OPRA carries out its duties under existing powers? Does it, as my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0589">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>217</span>
suggests in his amendment, intervene only where there is a clear breach, or does it sometimes conduct random inspections?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the former—OPRA becomes involved when it has good reason to do so. I shall speak in more detail about how that works in practice. It is an important point, because OPRA's record will reassure the Committee about how it will use its new powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 4 mirrors the provisions of section 99 of the 1995 Act, but modifies them so that they are appropriate to employer access requirements. The main difference is that the premises of any relevant employer can be inspected if relevant documents are kept there rather than just those of an occupational scheme employer. The approach to enforcement and inspection is similar, although the substantive obligation to be regulated is specific to the stakeholder framework.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
OPRA will not be expected to use its powers of inspection on a routine basis. I reassure the hon. Member for Newbury that nothing draconian is envisaged. It is worth pointing out that OPRA is funded by a levy on the industry. It enjoys wide support in the industry because of the extra reassurance that it provides to pension scheme members. OPRA is tightly funded and there is no question of its embarking on spurious raids and inspections without good cause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric Pickles 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brentwood and Ongar)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find that response reassuring. Will the Minister spell out why he does not believe that what are sometimes called "fishing trips" or "mystery shopping trips" will take place? I thought for a minute that he said that they would not take place because OPRA is poorly funded and its finances prevent it, but I am sure that that was not his intention. What in law prevents OPRA from embarking on that course of action? What will prevent an over-officious official from deciding to embark on a series of "mystery shops"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should consider OPRA's record so far. It already has discretion over the way in which it uses its powers. In practice, it has adopted a pragmatic and proportionate approach to breaches of the legislation. It treats persistent and deliberate disregard of the rules and fraudulent or dishonest action seriously. However, its overall aim is—and has to be given its nature—to develop constructive links with the bodies that it regulates. That is the best assurance that I can provide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of my concerns about amendment No. 33 is that it would remove the flexibility that OPRA currently enjoys. Like every other public authority, it is under a general duty to use its powers appropriately and not in an arbitrary fashion. Therefore, there are general safeguards in law to cover that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We expect OPRA to regulate the conduct of stakeholder pension schemes and employers' compliance with clause 3 provisions in much the same way as it currently regulates occupational pension schemes. Broadly speaking, that means dealing with problems as they arise, seeking to resolve reported breaches by making inquiries and obtaining information on a voluntary basis. Experience so far has shown that enforcement powers for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>218</span>
OPRA's current activities in regulating occupational schemes are used as a last resort only where there is evidence that those involved in running the schemes are not meeting their obligations and where other means of obtaining necessary information have failed. In nearly two years of operation, OPRA has needed to enter premises to inspect documents on only a handful of occasions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rendel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to hear that the powers that are already in place have so far been used in a sensible and not over-draconian manner. How often do the Government review how the powers are used? That was the point of my amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was coming to that point because I accept that that concern is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 26 and 27 would require the Secretary of State to review the powers on an annual basis as a matter of routine, and the hon. Member for Newbury reminded the Committee of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All Committee members will be concerned about the potential impact of the proposals on employers. As the Green Paper made clear, we want to minimise the effect on employers, especially small businesses. It is right that there should be proper scrutiny and evaluation of how the powers will be used. I accept the hon. Gentleman's point, but the amendments are not necessary to achieve that aim. The stakeholder pension provisions as a whole, including this element, will be kept under review to ensure that they work as we intend. I can give the Committee that commitment. When appropriate, the Secretary of State can amend provisions to restore our aims if, in practice, it emerges that something different is happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is already a track record that may encourage the hon. Gentleman. Close liaison between OPRA and officials in the Department of Social Security has enabled some difficulties with the operation of the 1995 Act to be identified at an early stage. Clause 9, which we shall discuss later today, introduces new and more proportionate measures to deal with non-compliance with the requirement on employers to pay employees' contributions to occupational pension schemes on time. I shall discuss the difficulties that have arisen from applying the 1995 Act when we reach clause 9, but the Bill introduces new measures to deal with those problems. In future, if we need to review this aspect of the current legislation, we will.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 15 would require OPRA to pay compensation when an employer incurs losses or costs exceeding £100 because of the actions of one of the authority's inspectors. The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) might have wanted reassurance about the scope of OPRA's powers and the supervision of its activities. There must be a process to ensure that public bodies do not exceed their statutory powers; they must give reassurance on that general issue. The amendment does not offer the most appropriate or effective way of resolving disputes that arise from the misuse of powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I spoke earlier abut the Contributions Agency, which provides a good example. For many years, it has had enforcement powers similar to those of OPRA.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0590">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>219</span>
The arrangements for the Contributions Agency impose neither a statutory obligation to reimburse costs, nor a requirement for a routine review of its powers. In addition, they do not restrict the organisation's discretion over the use of its powers. Such arrangements would be unduly prescriptive. Introducing them for stakeholder pension schemes would be out of step with existing arrangements that cover other bodies, which have worked well over a long period. It would also be out of step with the powers given to OPRA under the Pensions Act 1995.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
OPRA already has a well established procedure for handling complaints about how it operates. When appropriate it can make ex-gratia payments to employers and others for whom it has caused unnecessary expense. Complaints that cannot be resolved internally are referred to an independent complaints investigator. OPRA is responsible for the regulation of 155,000 occupational schemes, and received six complaints in 1997–98; all but one of those were resolved without referral to the independent complaints adjudicator. The system is working well and, of course, it is important that it continues to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have reassured the Committee on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know if the Minister intends to deal with the points that I asked about—they are relevant to our debate about the duties that will be placed on employers. He may remember that I asked about the explanatory notes, which state:
	<br><q><p>"The intention is to strike a balance between costs to the employer and flexibility for the member, so there is also a regulation-making power to prescribe restrictions on this requirement."</p></q>
That requirement would be for employers to provide employees with access to schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That reference is relevant because, if the Minister is to make regulations to ease the burdens on small employers, much of the debate might be unnecessary. We can be creative and help small employers by making the scheme employer-friendly. I hope that the Minister sees my point; I do not know whether he wants to respond to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see the point and I take it. At this stage, there is no need to issue regulations to restrict the power further. If, in the light of experience, that proves necessary, such a measure will be possible. In practice, OPRA has worked well with the organisations that it regulates. From the experience of OPRA's work in the past couple of years, thee is no basis for concern that it will act in anything other than a proportionate and pragmatic way. If the hon. Member for Gainsborough looked at the record, he would see that there were no grounds for concern. Regulations will not be necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to press the point, but it is important. I am not clear about the type of scheme that OPRA deals with. I would like reassurance about the amount of experience that OPRA has of dealing with complex pension arrangements for very small employers. I suspect that it might have less experience in those matters than in dealing with the arrangements for larger employers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>220</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: OPRA is responsible for the regulation of all occupational pension schemes. Some are for small companies, although many occupational schemes are very large. There are 155,000 schemes all told, and some are small. However, OPRA's duty is to ensure that employers provide access to a stakeholder pension scheme. We are not discussing employers who run their own pension schemes, unlike the others for which OPRA is responsible. OPRA has a tightly defined area of interest in the employers' concerns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to intervene, but I want to make an important point. The relevant employers must provide reasonable access to information about the schemes. I agree with the Minister that very small employers—we do not know the cut-off point, but, for example, those employing two, three or four people—must have information about the schemes and pass it on to their employees. How much help will they be given to lessen the burden? It appears that it will be a complicated process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It need not be complicated. Employers are required only to draw the attention of their employees to a stakeholder scheme, a full list of which will be on a register to be maintained by OPRA. Employers will not have to provide their employees with difficult or complicated information. They must arrange for deductions from the payroll to the scheme. It is much less complicated than the present scheme for the existing 155,000 employers, which is regulated by OPRA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not minimise the importance of the matter that the hon. Gentleman raised, but here are no grounds for his anxiety about how the scheme will work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Jacqui Lait 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beckenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to pursue the matter, but there is a slight difference in the wording of the Pensions Act 1995 and the clause. Clause 4(2)(c) states:
	<br><q><p>"the administration of the employer's business",</p></q>
whereas the 1995 Act refers to the administration of the scheme. By using the much broader definition of "employer's business", the Government may be trying to bring in the smaller businesses, assuming that their operations are smaller, whereas in the 1995 Act the scheme is administered from outside the employer's business. My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough referred to the burden on small businesses and I wonder whether what the clause proposes will be the most effective way for OPRA to operate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is right: there is a difference in the wording. As I said to the hon. Member for Gainsborough, the reason is that the clause is about not where the scheme is being administered but where the business of the employer who is giving access is conducted. There is a difference in the wording for that reason, because the purpose is to ensure that the employer provides access to the stakeholder scheme. That is a small, but inevitable, difference given the nature of the requirement envisaged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0591">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>221</span>
I hope that I have reassured the Committee about how the powers in the clause will be used and explained why the amendments are unnecessary. I gladly recognise Opposition Members' valid anxieties but I hope that in the light of my reassurance they will ask leave to withdraw the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to hit the panic button on the assurance given in a previous sitting about the threshold of employees. I know the hon. Gentleman: he would not be happy for an assurance that was given and accepted in good faith by both sides of the Committee retrospectively to be made invalid. I hope that there will be no problems and I shall say no more about the matter on this occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are three things wrong with the Government's position. The Minister put forward two arguments for not accepting our amendments, which do not stand up to scrutiny. In addition, there is a third thing wrong with the Government's position, which is the most serious matter of all. The Minister said that he was merely replicating the wording of the 1995 Act. However, stakeholder pensions are different. Unlike most occupational pensions and final salary schemes, they will in many cases involve small companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a general principle, that is a bad way for a Government to proceed. We should make use of the Committee's deliberation to improve pensions law. We should not simply say that as provisions have been made in a 1995 or 1895 Act, the matter is sacrosanct and therefore should be left alone. That is an appalling way to legislate. It means that in many cases legislation becomes an encrustation of inappropriate and excessively complicated measures—measures are never properly revised or looked at afresh and every Bill that comes before the House only adds to the coral reef of legislation. That is a great mistake. We should improve pensions measures, if possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a great believer in a zero-based approach to legislating; clearly, the Government are not. Time spent on measures such as the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill should be used to improve them. Labour Members are not interested in Committee proceedings, as none of them are taking part in our discussions, although one of them intervened earlier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is off the mark, as far as the amendments are concerned. Will he please restrict his remarks to the amendments and not make a general argument?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am addressing the Government's argument for not accepting our amendment, which they said would produce a text different to that of the 1995 Act. Pointing out that that is not an acceptable excuse is pertinent. Indeed, the argument may work the other way and it is the Government's reasoning that is irrelevant. We should take the opportunity to examine matters afresh.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right to say that there have been problems with the 1995 Act. However, there have not been any problems in the area that we are
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>222</span>
discussing. As the measure has worked well—the hon. Gentleman has not argued that it has not done so—there is no need for change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his stab at the matter, which brings me to his argument that matters should be left alone. That is because OPRA has conducted itself perfectly sensibly and has not taken advantage of excessively widely drawn powers in the 1995 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the Minister's view of OPRA. Since assuming my present responsibilities, I have visited the organisation in Brighton. It made a good impression on me. It was not vast bureaucracy, as I had feared and the people who worked for it seemed to be extremely sensible. The Minister said that only six complaints have been made in the past year. I do not suppose—and I have not heard otherwise—that OPRA goes in for onerous, vexatious or abusive inspections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's argument collapses at this point. The existing measure is broadly drafted. However, it has been found unnecessary in practice for OPRA to have such widely drawn and potentially autocratic powers. In considering the Bill, why not take the opportunity to redraw the powers of inspection to correspond with the reality, jurisprudence and practice of the powers required by OPRA? We should take advantage of past experience and reform and simplify the legislation to make it less onerous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, that is precisely what a deregulatory Government would do and precisely what I would do if I were the Minister. It is unfortunate that the Minister does not want to do that. The difference between us is represented in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third seriously wrong aspect of the provision is probably the main reason why the Government do not want to accept our amendment. It reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the pensions industry on the part of the Government. OPRA was established to supervise traditional occupational schemes, not personal pension schemes. Traditional schemes have largely been salary-related. At present, no final salary schemes are being created. Some have been wound up or replaced by group personal pensions or money purchase schemes, which is unfortunate. OPRA was originally designed to supervise and inspect—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. What ORPA was originally designed for has nothing to do with the amendments. I have had to remind the hon. Gentleman to stay in order on four or five occasions this morning He will have noted that and he must stay within the narrow terms of the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This goes to heart of the difference between the 1995 Act and the present situation, Mr. Malins, which is precisely what the Government have misunderstood. Stakeholder pensions are not final salary schemes. Therefore, the risks that apply to final salary occupational schemes cannot, by definition, apply to money purchase arrangements. We lost our amendment on clause 1. As a result of that loss, stakeholder pensions can only be money purchase schemes. I regret that, but
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0592">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>223</span>
that is what applies now. It follows that OPRA's task in supervising and inspecting money purchase schemes will be different from its task for salary-related schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have not understood that one of the major concerns of OPRA is the solvency of final salary schemes and whether employers have made sufficient contributions to maintain it. That does not apply to stakeholder schemes. Therefore, however necessary inspections are for final salary schemes, they are less required for money purchase schemes. However onerous, complicated and widely drawn were the powers in the 1995 Act, there is no reason to carry them forward in the Bill. The Government should recognise that difference and cut back on the inspection powers in the Bill. Some aspects of OPRA's responsibilities may be the same as for final salary schemes, but not others. By definition, some of the major elements of final salary schemes that need inspecting cannot arise in relation to stakeholder schemes, yet we are now designing an inspection regime for stakeholder schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to ensure that no misunderstanding is taking place. OPRA is already responsible for regulating occupational money purchase schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed it is, but the Minister knows perfectly well that the 1995 Act was intended to create a framework that would preserve employee rights in final salary schemes and prevent Maxwell-type malversation from taking place. The Minister knows that chapters of that Act dealt with the obligations of employers to maintain the solvency of schemes and with what would happen if they did not. Many draconian powers flowed from that Act, but they are irrelevant to stakeholder pensions, which can only be money purchase schemes. Therefore, by definition, the inspection regime should not be the same: it does not need to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We come back again to the Government's fundamental misunderstanding, which lies at the heart of the stakeholder concept, that the same kind of structure, that applies naturally to the final salary occupational scheme with trusts and OPRA inspections, should apply to a stakeholder scheme. That is the third thing that is wrong with the Government's approach and it is why we do not think that the Government have done a proper job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not getting at the Minister personally. I know that he inherited the Bill from his predecessor, who produced the Green Paper. As the Government had no intention of making a reality of the consultation exercise, they had presumably largely drafted the Bill before the Minister took over. The Bill is based on a fundamental confusion in the Government's mind, which has emerged here. The stakeholder is a different animal, so a different and lighter form of inspection is required. Even with a more complex animal, such as the final salary scheme, where a much wider range of things can go wrong, on the Minister's own testimony this morning there has been little need for inspection. Therefore, why have the Government proposed this extremely complicated structure? They have not thought it through properly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are again straying into clause stand part territory. Judging by the general nature of this debate, I am minded to consider whether we should debate clause stand part. I hope that we can stay within the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The points that I have been making under our amendments, Mr. Malins, which attempt to change fundamentally the inspection regime, are the only major points that Opposition Members seek to make on the clause.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is not what I said, I simply indicated to the Committee that I was minded to consider the point in due course. We are currently within the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand, Mr. Malins. I want to explain what we shall do about the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may first respond to the sensible intervention by my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait). She is right to say that there are only two possible explanations for what the Government have done. The first is regulatory madness—to regulate for the sake of regulating and, quite unnecessarily, to draft the widest possible powers for all the inspectors, bureaucrats and regulators. That is probably a reflection of new Labour's general approach—excessive regulation in the nanny state. The second explanation is that it is a fundamental misunderstanding. After several sittings of the Committee the Government still have not understood—they might have done if they had had a proper consultation period—that there is a fundamental difference between the proposed stakeholder scheme and the occupational schemes that OPRA was originally set up to regulate and inspect. The sooner the Government realise that, the better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are we to do abut it? Liberal Members often table amendments not intending to press them, but if the hon. Member for Newbury is minded to press his amendment to a vote, we shall support it. It is not good enough for the Minister simply to say that from time to time the Government will consider the matter. We want disciplines in place under which the Secretary of State will have to consider it every year and, if the Liberal amendment is accepted, he will have to ask OPRA how many inspections there were, what they found and what the reasons for the inspection were—the prima facie issues addressed in my amendment. All that will come out. It is a necessary discipline. There should be a countervailing check and balance in the system, rather than a regulator being given carte blanche, even if, as has been the case up to now with OPRA and I pray will always be the case, the officials running the show have not made use of those excessive powers.

sensible ideas from time to time. I am happy to endorse amendment No. 27. Perhaps it should be pressed to a vote—if he does not do so, I might even do so myself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 15 is a probing amendment. I see some difficulties in incorporating the £100 rule in legislation in practice, and we shall not press it to a vote. We tabled it in the hope that it would provoke the kind of discussion that we have had.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 33 goes to the heart of the matter. It raises questions about when and why inspections should take place, and about the disciplines that will apply to the regulator to ensure that there is no abuse. I do not accuse OPRA of abuse or of vexatious use of its current powers but, even if it is a saint so far as regulators go, it is not right to draft excessive powers for use by anyone, anywhere, at any time. All hon. Members must be restrained in the powers that we create, especially if those powers can be used to interfere with the way in which people run their lives—and their businesses—in a free society. I hope that my hon. Friends will join me in supporting that important amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to withdraw amendment No. 15, but I want to press amendment No. 33 to the vote. I shall leave it to the hon. Member for Newbury to decide what to do with amendment No. 27—I have already explained our view of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Procedurally, the hon. Gentleman cannot withdraw amendment No. 15.

On a point of order, Mr. Malins. I seek your advice. The hon. member for Newbury is about to withdraw amendment No. 26. How can we ensure that we vote on amendments that are grouped with that amendment? I am interested in amendment No. 27, on which there should be a vote. The Liberal Democrats may be under instructions from their bosses not to do anything to upset the Government, with whom they are in a de facto coalition. The hon. Gentleman came up with a sensible amendment, and we believe that it should be voted on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Malins. What is happening? I am at a loss. We hope and intend to vote on amendments No. 33 and 27. Can you give me guidance on how we should do that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those matters can be voted on when we reach them. We are following the order in the amendment paper, and we have not currently reached the appropriate stage at which to vote on those amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Government amendment No. 18, in page 4, line 11, leave out 'of relevant employees'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment, and those grouped with it, correct minor errors in the clause's drafting. I shall explain the background.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 3, which will establish the access requirement, will apply the requirements in respect of an employer's "relevant employees", the concept of which we have already discussed. They include all employees except those who are eligible to join an occupational pension scheme or who earn less than the lower limit for national insurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We intend that the authority can use those powers in respect of employers who no longer employ any "relevant employees", but who should have complied with the requirement in the past. Such a circumstance is conceivable. The authority should also be able to check whether employers have "relevant employees" and should, therefore, comply with the requirements. As it is drafted, the reference to "relevant employees" would enable the authority to take action only where an employer is known to have "relevant employees" at the time of the investigation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may have misunderstood the hon. Gentleman, but will the provision apply retrospectively to those employers who, in the past, would have been required to comply with the clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Lady has misunderstood, although that may well be my fault. We want OPRA to be empowered to investigate employers who have employed relevant employees in the past, even if they do not employ relevant employees at the time of the investigation. I hope that that explains the purpose of the amendments, which is simply to restore the intention behind the clause. They would bring about the original aims of the clause and I commend them to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, the amendment corrects what was simply a drafting error in the Bill. We all make drafting amendments—I shall doubtless make some myself—and we shall therefore vote for the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Government amendment No. 19, in page 4, line 18, leave out 'provisions' and insert 'requirements'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 20.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This amendment is technical. Subsection (1) refers to obligations imposed on employers in clause 3 as "requirements", but refers to them as "provisions" in paragraphs (b) and (c). The amendments would replace the word, "provisions" with the word, "requirements", which would ensure that references to the employer access requirements are consistent throughout the clause. I commend the amendment to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was slightly intrigued by the amendment, because I could not see the difference between "provisions" and "requirements". I expected a philosophical or linguistic dissertation from the Minister on the difference between the two terms. I agree that, if the two words have different meanings, one should be used consistently for the avoidance of doubt. However, perhaps he would provide an explanation before we vote on the amendment, so that I shall understand the difference as he sees it when the problem arises again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The concern is simply to use one term rather than two. I shall resist the tempting invitation to embark on a philosophical discourse on the difference between "provisions" and "requirements".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, was interested in this change of terminology. I wondered whether it was of a piece with our theory that a presumption has been made in favour of inspection and, therefore, of heavy-handedness. Given that the clause is broadly copied from the Pensions Act 1995, why is the Bill's wording to be changed? Does the 1995 Act also contain the word, "requirement"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pretty sure, although I do not have the relevant part of the Act in front of me, that the two are consistent. If the hon. Lady has the relevant section, perhaps she will draw it to my attention if that is not the case. The Government are concerned that the terms used in legislation should be consistent, even if the previous Government were less punctilious in that respect. That concern underlies the two amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following: Government amendments Nos. 24 and 25.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government new clause 1—	<i>Obtaining information with respect to compliance with section 3.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this group of amendments, we make it explicit that a power that is already available to OPRA under the 1995 Act is also available in relation to stakeholder pensions. Amendment No. 22 removes parts of clause 4 that are now included in new clause 1. Amendment No. 24 amends a drafting error, which meant that part of schedule 1 referred erroneously to the current Bill rather than to the Pensions Act 1995.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 25 ensures that OPRA will have the power to investigate breaches of corresponding legislation in Northern Ireland. OPRA already has similar powers to investigate breaches of the 1993 and 1995 Acts in Northern Ireland. The amendment also provides for OPRA to use its powers to investigate whether an occupational pension scheme complies with the basic conditions for stakeholder pension schemes, so as to decide whether a scheme should be on the register, whether penalties might apply and whether an offence might have been committed. Paragraph 2 of the schedule already provides for OPRA to have those powers in relation to other types of stakeholder pension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 1 gives OPRA a power to require the production of documents that are relevant to the issue of whether an employer is complying, or has complied, with the employer access requirements. It also enables OPRA to obtain a warrant to investigate where a person has not produced the required documents, or in certain other circumstances. That mirrors the powers that OPRA already has in relation to occupational pension schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
OPRA currently has considerable powers of investigation in relation to occupational pension schemes. Those powers allow it to carry out the functions given to it by Parliament and by the 1995 Act. If the need arises during the course of an investigation, it can inspect premises, interview individuals, require the production of documents and obtain warrants enabling it to seize and retain documents. It does not use those powers lightly, but it is right that it should have them, so that it can properly investigate cases of wrongdoing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want similar powers to apply to stakeholder pension schemes and to the new processes involved. We are confident that OPRA will exercise similar restraint in the use of those powers but, again, it is important that it has them, so that it can protect the interests of members of stakeholder pension schemes and ensure that there are not the problems with stakeholder pensions that have occurred in the past. I commend the amendments to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>APPLICATION OF CERTAIN ENACTMENTS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause applies a number of sections of the Employment Rights Act 1996, the Pension Schemes Act 1993 and the Pensions Act 1995 to stakeholder pension schemes. It also brings schedule 1 into force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Powers in the Employment Rights Act 1996 will protect individuals who act as trustees for this stakeholder pension scheme that has been nominated by their employer—for example, they must be given a reasonable amount of time off to perform their trustee duties. The protections are important because we want to encourage people to be trustees, and they should not be penalised by their employer for doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule 1 applies sections of the Pensions Schemes Act 1993 and the Pensions Act 1995 to trust-based stakeholder pension schemes. The requirements that it places on trustees of stakeholder pension schemes are similar to those that apply to trustees of occupational pensions schemes. It allows OPRA to supervise the conduct of stakeholder pensions schemes trustees in much the same way as it supervises trustees of occupational pension schemes. The schedule also allows the Pensions Compensation Board to impose a levy on trust-based stakeholder pension schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We see trust-based arrangements as a good, well-established way of ensuring that schemes are run in the interests of members. The schedule extends relevant trustee legislation to trust-based stakeholder pension schemes. It also gives OPRA the power to investigate compliance with conditions that were set out in clause 1. OPRA will decide whether steps have been taken to comply with those conditions or whether anyone has misled it in applying for registration. The Committee is aware that we have not ruled out the possibility that non-trust-based schemes may be set up as long as they offer a comparable outcome for members. The schedule extends OPRA's powers of investigation to those schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a fascinating clause. Once again, the Government do not know what they are doing. They have decided to set up stakeholder pensions and have heard that occupational pension schemes are a good idea, so they have designed the stakeholder scheme as an occupational pension scheme. However, the complicated, top-heavy structure of trusts is inappropriate for pensions in the modern world unless they are company salary-related schemes, which the Government excluded from the stakeholder regime in clause 1. Although some stakeholder pensions might be company schemes, it is unlikely that smaller employers, whom the Bill targets, will have enough employees to warrant such a scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is becoming clear that the Minister of State inherited an ill-thought-out idea from his predecessor. The Green Paper was compiled in a great hurry—references to compulsory pensions for people earning more than £9,000 a year were not removed in time for the printer—and the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0596">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>231</span>
Government treated the consultation exercise with contempt. It is not surprising that we have a shambolic Bill, and nowhere is that more apparent than in this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) provides that trustees can have time off. It mimics provisions in those Acts that established the framework for occupational pension schemes, which were largely final salary schemes. It is clear that the Minister's predecessor based the stakeholder pension on schemes run by BP or ICI. That set an inappropriate precedent. It is as if someone who designed passenger motor cars started to design an aircraft and decided that it needed an exhaust and four tyres but no wings. It is a shoddy job. Let me ask the Minister a few questions about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are the trustees for? On clause 1 we discussed the reasons why we needed trusts and the fact that the Treasury does not think that they are necessary to establish a lifelong individual savings account, which is probably much more sensibly conceived as a pension vehicle than the stakeholder pension. What will the trustees do? What do they need time off for? We have already established that the charges for administering stakeholder pension schemes will be fixed by regulations, although the Government refuse, once again, to tell us in advance what they will say. We do not know what level the charges will be fixed at, but we know that they will be fixed. Therefore, the trustees will not negotiate charges with the managers of the pension scheme. That is a traditional job for trustees—making sure that the charges are not unduly onerous and that, where a pension fund manager is expensive, other offers are solicited and competition brought into play. That is not relevant here, because the Government are fixing the charges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You heard me poke fun at that. Mr. Malins, as did Mr. McWilliam, and say how absurd it was that the Government should fix prices in the economy: why do they not fix the price of ice creams or television sets? Whether it is absurd or not, the Government will fix prices, so the trustees will not need time off to do so. What will they do?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the fund managers be chosen on the basis of the portfolio management policy that the Government think is appropriate for the scheme? That is a traditional role for trustees, and time off is necessary for that purpose. The inappropriate analogy that the Minister's predecessor was working on for stakeholder schemes was that if trustees of a pension scheme have to interview some extremely sophisticated fund managers and Warburg, Merrill Lynch, J P Morgan and so forth are all competing to manage the fund, they must take some time off. They must make sure that they are up to speed with modern portfolio management and the performance of comparable pension funds and are not too easily misled by the clever and aggressive marketing in which such fund managers have developed a speciality. Trustees certainly need time off for that kind of thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have discovered that the stakeholder schemes will be tracker schemes. It is plain that there will be no scope for discretionary fund management, because the charges
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>232</span>
will not allow it. One does not need a fund manager to run a tracker scheme; all one needs is a computer. In a tracker scheme, one invests with the index. One decides on the index and that is the end of the decision. It does not matter who runs it: one simply needs a computer. The scheme does not need sophisticated fund managers to fly in from New York, Frankfurt or wherever and make competing presentations, while the trustees sit there and ask intelligent questions. It is absurd to apply that model to stakeholder pension schemes. Such issues do not begin to arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here we have subsection (2)—I have not invented it, Mr. Marlins; if I had, you would have called me to order by now—which says that the trustees must take time off to fulfil their duties. It is a direct and inappropriate analogy to borrow this system of trusts and trustees from a totally different type of scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another thing that trustees do in large company schemes—as I said earlier, they do it in the House of Commons scheme—is talk to members about their pension, about how things are going if it is a money purchase scheme, or whether there is a chance of getting better benefits if it is a final salary scheme. The trustees act as intermediaries between the beneficiaries in a large Company's scheme and the management of the scheme or the company providing the final salary-related scheme, if it is a salary-related scheme. That makes complete sense. It is right that the Employment Rights Act 1996 provides for trustees to have time off for such a purpose. It is irrelevant in this context, however, we have already agreed that the schemes will not be company-wide. People will not know the trustees unless it is purely by accident. Goodness knows where the trustees will come from and how they will be chosen. Will they be paid for no purpose at all? If they are not paid, why would they want to do the job?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Someone from the House of Commons or ICI might—in the interests of their colleagues and the institution to which they are proud to belong—want to serve as a trustee on a scheme, as it is an important role. Such an analogy would not be appropriate for stakeholder pensions, however, as they will be set up by an insurance company or life office and will be sold to 2,000 employers with an average of seven and a half employees. Clearly, trustees will not have a role as intermediaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What do trustees of occupational pension schemes do? In final salary schemes, they are the counterweight to the employer. It is their job to point out to an employer that a scheme's benefits are not as good as they could be, for example, if the scheme was based on fiftieths rather than sixtieths. Alternatively, they might suggest that a scheme with a good surplus might be able to provide better benefits for widows within the Revenue rules. That is an important and honourable role for trustees. I pay tribute to the thousands of trustees in this country who play such a role. It is largely a result of their efforts—as well as the far-sighted and judicious commitment of many major employers, and some smaller employers, to the final salary principle—that such a good occupational pension scheme structure exists in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Employees who are trustees must be given time off for that purpose. If they are negotiating with their employer on behalf of their colleagues, they cannot be put in a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0597">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>233</span>
situation in which they can be told, "Back to work, Jack. The shift hasn't finished". If the employer does not like what the trustees are saying to him, he can threaten to fire them if they are not back at their desk or bench in two minutes. We do not want that to happen—it does not arise frequently in the humanely managed companies that provide such final salary schemes—and that is why employment protection for trustees is in place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None of that is relevant to the stakeholder structure, however, because the Government excluded final salary schemes from that structure in clause 1. We tried to reintroduce them—as you will recall, Mr. Malins—but failed because of the Labour party's vast majority in Parliament and, therefore, in this Committee. As a result, the structure is completely inappropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I submit that trustees having time off is premised on the assumption that they have something to do. My point—I know that you will have listened to me with your usual rigorous attention, Mr. Malins—concerns the contrast between the tasks of trustees in trust-based schemes where trusts are appropriate and trustees have a genuine role, and the complete irrelevance of trusts in stakeholder schemes. They will not only be irrelevant, but expensive and encumbering, and trustees will have nothing to do. Why do we need to provide for time off for trustees who will not be able to fulfil the classic functions of a trustee in the schemes for which trusts and trustees were designed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There can be only one explanation for this extraordinary anomaly—that, in plain language, the Government simply do not know what they are doing. They had a stakeholder pension scheme commitment in the Labour manifesto; they spent 20 months thrashing around deciding what to do about it; they could not make up their minds; they produced a document that was evidently cobbled together at the last minute without due thought; and they have not consulted. As a result, they have ended up with nonsensical provisions. The clause is one more symptom. We have already seen others and we will see even more as we progress through the Bill.

Will the Minister rise and explain what the trustees are supposed to be doing that requires them to take time off work? If trustees in stakeholder trusts are required for any useful purpose—I do not believe that they are—what precisely is it? I have already argued that, by definition, they will be unable to perform the four or five essential functions that they can perform in the quite different world of salary-related occupational pension schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have done shoddy work. They have drawn a rapid and inappropriate analogy from occupational pension schemes to stakeholder schemes. As a result, we are confronted with the nonsense that we are debating this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly to support my hon. Friend in everything that he said. There is a real problem with how the Government's stakeholder schemes will affect small businesses. Some employees working in small businesses
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>234</span>
may believe that they have their own pension scheme as stakeholders and that they will be able to influence it as trustees. They may not automatically think in terms of becoming trustees to have time off work, but they may well be disappointed because a stakeholder scheme will not be set up for one company or business. Their stakeholder contributions will be put into a much larger scheme run, as my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford said, by an insurance company or other large City institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Employees of smaller companies might dream of influencing the pension that they will receive at the end of their working lives, but they will be sorely disappointed. They will not have time off to choose fund managers. They will not be able to decide whether they want more ethical investments—perhaps not in tobacco companies, or, going back to the bad old days, in Barclay's because of its dealings in South Africa. Those and other issues may continue to be live, but employees will not be able to engage with them because they cannot be trustees of pension funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend that the clause is unnecessary and could potentially mislead stakeholders into believing that they will be able to exert real influence and have time off work to do so. Our long debate has demonstrated that the Government fundamentally misunderstand the way in which stakeholder pension schemes will affect work. It will greatly disappoint employees of small businesses when they find that they will not have the control over their pension funds that they assumed they would have by virtue of their becoming stakeholders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have been around this course a few times already, so I shall be brief. It is essential to have an effective mechanism—the trust mechanism—at the heart of the Government's regime for stakeholder pensions to ensure that members' interests are protected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman contending that in the case of personal pensions, the majority of which are not established on a trust system, or of the Treasury's proposals for LISAs, there is inadequate protection for the investor or the pensioner because of the absence of a trust? It that what the hon. Gentleman is saying?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows well that there were serious problems in the early days of personal pensions because of mis-selling. I was disappointed that he did not mention the matter earlier, as he has done in previous sittings—unlike his hon. Friends who have not mentioned it at all. The hon. Gentleman rightly acknowledged the scale of the problem and, by implication, recognised the importance of a stakeholder pension mechanism to ensure that the disaster of mis-selling is not repeated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Either, the Minister is deliberately throwing up a smoke screen of irrelevancies or he has not understood a fundamental matter: trustees are not relevant to the selling of a pension scheme in any circumstances.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0598">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>235</span>
They are relevant to the management of that scheme on behalf of the beneficiaries. Trustees are in no sense a protection against mis-selling. If that is what the hon. Gentleman is saying, it is absurd. He cannot seriously be saying that the mis-selling would not have occurred if personal pensions had been established on the basis of a trust. The intermediaries and the life offices mis-sold. Whether trusts were responsible for the continuing management of the schemes is neither here nor there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Trustees will be responsible for the entire operation of a pension scheme. They will ensure that the scheme is operated to protect the interests of its members and those who join it. That factor was absent from personal pensions; we are building that protection into the heart of stakeholder pensions from the outset. We are confident that it will protect members' interests in a way that was not achieved with personal pensions. That is why it is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was pleased that the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford paid tribute to occupational scheme trustees. His view differs from that of his hon. Friends, who earlier made insulting remarks about pension fund trustees, saying that they were conservative and inept octogenarian solicitors. I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman re-stated his support for the work of occupational fund trustees. The virtues that he extolled should be available to those who join a stakeholder pension scheme because there is no occupational scheme for them to join.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman fails to acknowledge that there are already trust-based, money-purchase schemes. I assure him that, contrary to what he believes, the trustees responsible for those schemes have plenty to do. In the stakeholder arrangement, they will be responsible for appointing administrators and fund managers to the scheme. They will negotiate with service providers to drive down charges for members; although it is true that we will set a limit on the charges, we will not set in regulation the precise level of charges. That will be a matter for negotiation and the trustees will have a responsibility in that respect. They will have a role in determining the scheme's investment strategy, including whether they should use tracker funds or active managers, or a mix of the two. They will be responsible for ensuring that scheme members receive appropriate information about the scheme and their rights within it. They will have a very big job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I again draw the attention of the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford to the report of independent Pension Provision Group—the hon. Gentleman attended the launch a couple of weeks ago—which welcomed the trustee basis for stakeholder pensions schemes. We resolved the matter some time ago and I hope that we shall not spend too much time repeating previous discussions in this debate. The measures in clause 5 are an entirely logical consequence of our earlier agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must seek leave to address the Committee again because what the Minister has just said will be hung around his neck. It is a terrible reflection of the Government's incompetence that they are proceeding
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>236</span>
on such a basis. We speak in Committee, knowing that our words will be recorded in 	<i>Hansard</i> and read by the outside world—some members of that world are sitting in this Room—which will judge whether the Minister has begun to understand how British pensions work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is extraordinary to suggest that the absence of trustees was a reason for the mis-selling of personal pensions. The Minister is wrong about that. Trustees do not get commission as they do not sell pensions. They should not be involved in such matters. Had trustees been involved in personal pension schemes, they would have been responsible for appointing fund managers and for certain administrative aspects of the schemes. Under no circumstances do trustees have a role in selling; therefore, they have no role in mis-selling or preventing mis-selling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister continues to put on record that the role of trustees is to negotiate charges with providers—that is why they need time off. The Government say that they will fix charges at a low level. There is nothing to be gained from quoting the Green Paper, in which a commitment is made that charges will be much lower than at present. Anyone who knows the first thing about pensions knows that fixing low charges means that such schemes will have to be managed through tracker funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, charges will not be negotiated. If charges set as a maximum by Government regulations are low, that will leave no room for going below that level. That will certainly be the case if such charges are set at the individual savings account cap level of 1 per cent. There will probably be no competition between the providers of stakeholder schemes on the basis of cost, and that is undesirable. Inevitably, maxima become minima.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
About all, there will be no scope for discretionary fund management. The Minister said that the trustees will decide whether stakeholder schemes will be managed on an active or passive basis. That reveals the Government's fundamental ignorance about the pensions market. Of course, money purchase pension schemes often have trustees, who have the role—although, in final salary schemes, it is not all their role—of negotiating charges with fund managers and discussing with them the principles of management. Such schemes have higher costs, so it is economic to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's words will be hung around his neck. Should the Government go ahead with the stakeholder pension scheme, those who take it up will do so on a tracker basis. Therefore there will be no role of trustees in the choice of fund management strategy or in pushing down charges further. It will be impossible to push down such charges further. Page 53 of the Green Paper deals with the level of charges. It states:
	<br><q><p>"The permitted charge level will be set later".</p></q>
So it is clear that the level will be set, as the Minister confirmed when we discussed clause 1. The Green paper also states:
	<br><q><p>"But we think the reassurance of a fixed standard is needed to enable stakeholder pension schemes to meet their aims."</p></q>
So the standard will be fixed. Paragraph 31 of the Green Paper states:
	<br><q><p>"The minimum standards will be built on the 'CAT' standards (cost, access and terms), which are to be used for Individual Savings Accounts".</p></q>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0599">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>237</span>
The Government produced a CAT standard for ISAs of 1 per cent. per annum, but that is at risk from the changes to the stamp duty regime announced in the Budget. It is possible that no one will deliver ISAs on the basis of that standard. There is certainly no scope within the 1 per cent. standard for discretionary fund management. Again, what the Minister said reflects the Government's fundamental ignorance of the pensions industry. They have the pretension and foolishness to try to regulate it without doing their homework, without waiting for the end of the consultation period, and without listening to anyone—the industry, outside experts or the Opposition. On that basis, we shall have to vote against this thoroughly ill-thought-through clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause concerns the protection of trustees and, in that sense, it is valuable. I have listened to the debate and what has concerned me is that few employees will be involved as trustees. As my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford said, the stakeholder pension will be a very conservative investment: it will be on a tracker basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should assure us that there will be opportunities for active management of the schemes. I make no apology for making that vital point again. No one suggests that we should return to the high-risk ventures of the past, or that employees should not be protected; no one denies that there was pension mis-selling. Everyone is concerned to ensure active protection of employees, but it is in our interests to make stakeholder pensions attractive. The Minister must convince us that there will be opportunities for managers to take some risks to ensure that the pensions are competitive and that people can receive the same rate of return from a stakeholder pension as from traditional private sector pensions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That this schedule, as amended, be the First schedule to the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to take the opportunity to ask the Minister a question. Most of the schedule is unexceptionable, although we do not accept that stakeholder pensions should be set up as trusts, which is a provision made in paragraph 1. Paragraph 1(2) (b) provides for the authority, in this case OPRA, to make levies on stakeholder pension schemes of the same type as, or in parallel to, the powers that they have to make levies on occupational pension schemes under the Pensions Acts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure whether the Minister wanted to rise to introduce the schedule, and I hope that he is not returning to the bad habit of not making his intentions clear. Perhaps that shows his slight feeling of embarrassment about the Bill, much of which is, I concede, caused by over-hasty or ill-informed drafting by his predecessor. He now has the invidious task of defending the Bill and making excuses for its shortcoming and contradictions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister did not want to introduce the schedule, that fact is interesting. I do not think that he was rising to try to catch your eye, Mr. Malins; if he was, I apologise. Out of courtesy, I would have allowed him to speak first on his own schedule and I thought that he wanted to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Levies are provided for in the schedule. We have already discussed the different nature of the regulatory function in relation to money purchase stakeholder schemes and occupational pension schemes, the bulk of which remain based on final salary. Is the same levy appropriate?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Stakeholder pensions schemes will arise only in the case of firms that do not have an occupational scheme. In many cases, employers may simply not have provided for their employees as generously as firms of a comparable size. However, some of them may be small and may not be able to cope with the burden of paying for or administering a pension scheme. As we discuss the Bill, we must be wary and to keep the additional burdens and costs on them to a minimum. At least the Government appear to share some of that concern and have endorsed it on one or two occasions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of small employers, will the levy be in proportion to the size of the firm or the number of employees? Will it be proportionate to the number of employees who use the stakeholder pension facility? As we have noted, some employees may prefer to remain
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0600">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>239</span>
with their own personal pension scheme or make other arrangements, perhaps through the Treasury's LISAs. Will the levies be based on the value of the funds invested in the scheme? What is the basis of charging and will the Minister tell us if he does not know the answer or has not thought about the matter?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister does not want to be as frank as that, will he say, "We will think about it"? Will he say that he will consult on the matter having learned the error of his ways in not allowing the consultation period on the Bill to end before it was brought before the House? Has the Minister learned that lesson? Will he now consult, and if so, who with and for how long? What can he say to remove the fear that might reasonably arise in the mind of anyone who reads the schedule, that it places yet another potential burden on employers? We have discussed the many burdens on them—expenses, inspections and the need to take technical advice from actuaries and accountants. Now, there will be additional levies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to accept the basic principle of regulation, which is that those who are regulated pay for the regulator. As the regulator is in a monopoly position vis-à-vis the regulated, it is important that there are controls and that the regulator cannot simply pass on to the regulated any costs or charges that he or she chooses to run up. We all know that regulators are bureaucracies. They may be fine bureaucracies, but they do not depend on market competition to remain in business. There is a great temptation to build up overhead, even if they do not deliberately set out to do that, because overhead has a way of building up in any organisation that is not subject to the disciplines of a competitive market. Then, if the regulator knows that he can lay off any charges that are incurred on the regulated by way of compulsory levies, for which Parliament has provided—as proposed in schedule 1—the burdens on the regulated could be excessive, with deleterious economic consequences and unfairness. The other side of the coin is that one can create bloated and excessively onerous regulatory systems. We do not want that, so let us at least have some straightforward assurances from the Minister on which we can rely, so we know that such fears are no more than theoretical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an extremely good Bill based on an extremely good Green Paper. I am happy to put that point on the record. Most of the hon. Gentleman's remarks rest on a misunderstanding. First, I did not rise to speak to schedule 1 because I had already spoken about it in my speech on clause 5, which was the appropriate place to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's other misunderstanding was that he seemed to be under the impression that we were proposing a levy on employers when we are proposing a levy on stakeholder schemes. No contribution will be required from employers, who will simply give their employees access to the scheme. There is a difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a fascinating aspect to this. If the levy is paid by the scheme, and the employer will not reimburse the scheme for the levy, will the levy come within the CAT marked or limited costs of the scheme,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>240</span>
so that if the Government put forward a 1 per cent. CAT marking proposal—that seems to be the way that they have been thinking until now, although they will not reveal the colour of their money—will the additional levy come within that or be additional to it? Pensioners need to know how much of the money that they pay is invested for their benefit and how much is abstracted for other purposes. Whether it is abstracted for the benefit of the regulator or for the benefit of managers makes no difference to the poor pensioner who is losing money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, the levy will be contained within the cost of the scheme, which will be within the levels set by regulation. We have just revised the levy for OPRA. The amount paid depends on the size of the scheme; it is not a flat sum. The same arrangement applies to OPRA as applies for compensation and it works well. Of course, occupational money purchase schemes already pay the levy and stakeholder schemes will pay it in the same way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister answer my question? When he says that the levy will depend on the size of the scheme, does he mean that it will depend on the number of employees or the amount of money invested in it? In addition, can he tell us the current range of OPRA levies that are imposed on the schemes that it regulates—occupational pension schemes—because he just said that stakeholder pension schemes would have to pay the same charges?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The charge varies according to the number of people in the scheme: that is the criterion that determines the charge. I shall gladly write to the hon. Gentleman and set out the current schedule of charges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>REDUCED RATES OF CONTRIBUTIONS ETC: POWER TO SPECIFY DIFFERENT PERCENTAGES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Questions proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause is about the treatment of national insurance contributions for members of stakeholder pension schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As members of the Committee will know, people whose membership of a pension scheme contracts them out of the state earnings related pension scheme are liable for a lower rate of national insurance contributions. The way in which that happens varies according to the type of scheme. Some members pay a lower rate of contributions. Others pay the normal rate but have part of their contributions rebated to the scheme. In some schemes, there is an element of both. I propose to refer simply to rebates, although the mechanisms will vary according to the type of contracted-out scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Stakeholder pension schemes will fall, in legislative terms, into one of the two existing general categories of pension schemes. They will either be occupational pension stakeholder schemes or personal pension
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0601">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>241</span>
stakeholder schemes. As a result, many of the existing legislative arrangements for contracting-out will apply to them automatically. So there is already provision, in the Pension Schemes Act 1993, for the arrangements for contracting out and for rebates to be paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, existing legislation provides only for a single rate of rebate to apply to money purchase occupational schemes and for a separate single rate of rebate to apply to personal pension schemes. Currently, it does not of course make further separate provision for stakeholder schemes, because they are a novelty. The clause provides a power to set different rebates for schemes that are stakeholder schemes as opposed to those that are not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rebate rates are set by the Secretary of State in the light of advice from the Government Actuary. The rates of rebate reflect the value of the state benefit forgone by contracting-out. The Government Actuary takes into account, among other things, the expense levels of schemes, which affect the cost of providing an equivalent benefit to that which has been given up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The expenses that are associated with a scheme are the crucial factor in determining the different rates of rebate that will be applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause will enable a different rate of rebate to be set for stakeholder pension schemes, if it turns out that it is appropriate to do so. The presence of that power does not mean that we will necessarily set different rebates. Decisions on rebate rates for stakeholder pension schemes will be taken later. We expect to lay the appropriate orders by April 2000—a year in advance of their introduction—as is required under existing legislation. However, the clause ensures that a different rate could be set for stakeholder pension schemes if it was judged appropriate to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rendel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned the laying of orders. Will they involve the affirmative or negative procedure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The normal procedure with regulations for pensions legislation is to use the negative procedure. We envisage that it will apply in this case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause also allows different rebate rates to be set for personal pensions, whether or not they qualify as stakeholder pensions, according to the date at which the member joined the scheme. That provides a new element of flexibility in setting rebate rates where the typical costs of schemes change over time—for example, following the introduction of stakeholder pension schemes. It would allow a different rate of rebate to be set for those who had already committed themselves to a pension scheme than for new members of schemes, if that was judged appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause provides an important flexibility for setting rebate rates in the future. Its powers may not always need to be used in practice. However, it is prudent to include them in the Bill—that will allow the most effective use to be made of significant public resources in the form of national insurance rebates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am informed that the information that I gave to the hon. Member for Newbury is not correct. Rebate orders
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>242</span>
involve the affirmative procedure and we expect them to do so in relation to stakeholder pensions. I apologise to the hon. Gentleman for misleading him earlier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a complex clause. I hope that the Minister will forgive me if, being equipped with only one brain, I did not understand all that he said. Can he help me by giving me an example? The explanatory notes state:
	<br><q><p>"The reduced rates reflect the cost of providing members with benefits of an equivalent value to the SERPS benefits they are giving up."</p></q>
If I understand that, somebody will give up an element of a SERPS benefit—I do not know how much—and will be recompensed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To explain that to me, can the Minister give a practical example? If he cannot do so now, can his civil servants help me by providing us with an example of a person who is on SERPS now and is joining a stakeholder scheme? Will the Minister explain some of the figures showing how he will be recompensed under the clause for any loss that he will suffer through the loss of his SERPS benefit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can give the hon. Gentleman some help. The essential difference is between three types of contacted-out scheme—contracted-out salary-related schemes, contracted-out money purchase schemes and personal pensions. A person who contracts out of SERPS foregoes all the benefits that he would have gained by staying in, but the amount of national insurance rebate given in respect of that contracting out depends on which of the three routes he takes. As I have said, the costs associated with each are different, so the costs of achieving comparable benefits in future are also different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me give one example. The arrangement in the contracted-out salary-related scheme, which is the standard occupational scheme, is straightforward—a 4.6 per cent. national insurance rebate, which can then be paid into the salary-related scheme with any additional contributions from the employer and the employee. However, the arrangements for contracted-out money purchase schemes and personal pensions schemes are different. In the former there are two elements in the rebate—a flat rate and an age-related element. For personal pensions the rebate is determined on an age-related basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be happy to provide the hon. Gentleman with further detail on those points if he would like me to, but I think that that gives an indication of the three different bases that are in use.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a quick question for the Minister so that it is clear in my mind, as I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough. Can a person who contracts out of SERPS to go into one of the schemes transfer his values from SERPS into that scheme or are they frozen?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, he cannot. If a person has been in SERPS for a period, when he reaches retirement age he will gain the benefit from that, but having contracted out, he receives no additional benefit from SERPS. All future benefit will come through the contracted-out scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rendel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little concerned about the clause. Clearly the Bill must contain a clause of this kind, as it would be wrong to allow stakeholder pensions to work without any rebates when other forms of pension have them. I am pleased to hear the Minister confirm that orders will be laid under the affirmative procedure, because to some extent that allays my fears.

The clause may tempt the Government to skew the attractiveness of stakeholder pensions compared to other forms of pension by setting the rebate at a different level from that set for personal pensions or occupational pensions outside the stakeholder system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to intervene. The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rendel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that that is the answer, but I shall leave it to the Minister to supply the answer to my question, rather than try to supply it myself in answer to the hon. Gentleman. Certainly I should welcome more explanation from the Government about how they expect to use this power, if they are given it. Do they intend to skew things in favour of stakeholder pensions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising this matter and, indeed, to the hon. Member for Gainsborough for providing an excellent answer. There is good reason to worry. There was concern that rebates had been skewed, in particular to favour the new personal pensions. There is no intention to skew the system for stakeholder pensions. We will await the advice of the Government Actuary, which we will apply even-handedly transparently to ensure that there is a level playing field so that people can make the decision that is in their best interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may divide my comments between the contributions and rebate aspects of the clause, which introduces incredible complexity into the prospective management by employers of their liability to make class 1 contributions. It is likely, as I am sure the Minister will confirm, that employers will have to distinguish between four different categories of employee and to provide four different levels of contribution, all of which will be calculated on a different basis. The first category covers contracted-in employees who have contracted into SERPS or its replacement, the state second pension. The second category relates to contracted-out employees who have moved into a final salary scheme, if the employer has one. The third category covers employees who have contracted out of a scheme into a stakeholder scheme—a money purchase scheme. The two schemes can co-exist because not all employees will have access to an occupational pension scheme, which may be wound up and replaced by a stakeholder scheme for new employees. That is a particular problem with the project.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>244</span>
The third category covers employees who are contracted out into a non-stakeholder, money purchase scheme,. That could be a personal pension—a defined contributions scheme—or a group personal pension. As the Government have not accepted our principle that group personal pensions should automatically become stakeholder schemes if they satisfy the criteria, some employers may continue their group personal pension schemes while they run the new stakeholder scheme, which they are obliged by law to establish. The group personal pension scheme, unlike the occupational pension scheme, is not exempted, although the emphasis seems to be changing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my analysis is correct, it is plausible that some employers will have to calculate their class 1 contribution liabilities in four different ways for different categories of employee. That is complex. It has implications for systems, software and costs. If things go wrong there will be inspections by the Contributions Agency and ORPA. The issue is serious. The Government are in a muddle because they resisted our sensible idea of an open, permissive stakeholder structure, which includes group personal pensions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is talking too generally. He must restrict himself to the clause stand part debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You are being very severe towards me this morning, Mr. Malins. I hope that you will agree that the need to have four different methods of calculating class 1 contributions is germane to the clause—it arises directly from it and all the problems that I have outlined are associated with it. I hope that I am permitted to say that, had the Government adopted our conception of the stakeholder pension, they could have avoided that complexity. For example, according to our definition, group personal pensions would have been stakeholder pensions. That would have reduced to three the number of possible ways of calculating class 1 contributions under the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be wrong for Parliament to pass such a clause without touching on its implications for the costs and difficulties associated with the administration of class 1 employers' insurance liabilities. I make no apology for saying that, in legislation, complexity itself is problematic. Wherever we can, we should avoid it and adopt simpler solutions. Perhaps the Government's failure to accept our solutions has got them into such a mess that they have no alternative. Perhaps we must accept the clause, along with our defeat on clause 1, in the wider national interest. However, as a result of those defeats, complexity is inevitable. I look forward to the Minister's response to that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far, I have considered the part of the clause that deals with contributions, but I now turn to rebates. The clause was introduced against a background of disgraceful behaviour in respect of rebates. The Government's abolition of the dividend tax credit after the general election imposed a tax on pension funds of £5 billion a year that is directly related to rebates. Given that benefits anticipated on the basis of existing rebate levels could no longer be achieved because money had been removed
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0603">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>245</span>
from pension schemes by the abolition of the dividend tax credit—or, as the Opposition like to describe it, the imposition of the pension tax—the question arose whether contributions through the SERPS rebate to occupational or personal pension schemes should be revalued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government responded by producing a differential rebate, which set a disgraceful precedent. I make the point forcefully because I do not want them to use the clause as a basis for repeating that mistake. Regrettably, the Government struck yet another blow to traditional, occupational pension schemes and to the principle of final salary schemes by failing to increase SERPS rebates paid to contracted-out, final salary schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Next, the Government significantly increased the SERPS rebate to personal pension schemes. They did so because there was a danger that, in circumstances where personal pensions would represent a less good deal in relation to SERPS because of the reduction in investment return from a personal pension vehicle, people would respond to the imposition of the pension tax and the abolition of the dividend tax credit by contracting back into SERPS. That would have had budgetary
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>246</span>
consequences for the Minister's masters in the Treasury. Therefore, the Government had to increase the rebate to the personal pension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, no such competition with SERPS in respect of contracting back applied in the case of the contracted-out money purchase schemes. I doubt whether the public realise that, to save money and compensate for additional moneys paid to personal pensions by way of increased SERPS rebate, the Government actually reduced the rebate to the contracted-out money purchase schemes. That was a disgraceful act, based on the spurious argument that the provision of administrative costs applying to the calculation of SERPS rebate to contracted-out money purchase schemes was excessively generous. If that were the case, the Government Actuary should have advised accordingly and made the change irrespective of the introduction of the pension tax. However, the Government were caught out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
