	<p>4.34 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Employment, Welfare to Work and Equal Opportunities (Ms Tessa Jowell)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Jobseeker's Allowance Amendment (New Deal) Regulations 1999.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the draft Jobseeker's Allowance (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 1999 and the draft Social Security (New Deal Pilot) Regulations 1999.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Winterton, I begin by saying what a pleasure it is to serve under your chairmanship to consider these three sets of regulations and I thank the hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow) for agreeing to consider them together, which makes good sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall take the Committee through the provisions of each set of regulations in turn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first set of regulations are concerned with the education and training opportunities within the national new deal for people aged 26 and over. At present, to be eligible to benefit from these opportunities, people have to have been in receipt of jobseeker's allowance for at least two years. However, the effect of the current regulations is to exclude people who are unemployed and claiming jobseeker's allowance but who are not actually receiving any benefit and only receive their national insurance contribution credits, for example, because they have a partner who is in a well-paid job. The regulations before the committee today correct that anomaly and will enable people who are only receiving their credits to take advantage of the help that is on offer, if they wish to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second set of regulations are rather technical, but their purpose is to ensure fair treatment of certain groups within the benefit system. They serve three purposes: first, they correct a defect in the current regulations and ensure that people are able to move smoothly to JSA if they have previously been claiming incapacity benefit and are then found to be capable of work by the all work test. At the moment, the process for notifying people that they are no longer eligible for incapacity benefit risks leaving them unable to claim JSA for a few days. The regulations will put that right. Secondly, they correct another defect in the current regulations and in doing so make sure, as originally intended, that prisoners who are released from detention and then claim JSA are given up to a week to re-adjust to normal life, by treating them as if they are meeting the labour market conditions. Thirdly, these regulations make a technical amendment to ensure that references to training and enterprise councils also cover chambers of commerce, training
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
and enterprise, which were formed when some TECs decided to merge with local chambers of commerce. We have already changed these references in other places in the legislation, but had to wait for an opportunity to make the change in regulations covered by positive resolutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want now to focus on the pilot regulations, and I make it clear that our policy intention is unchanged. The powers in the Jobseekers Act 1995 mean that pilot regulations can last only for 12 months. But when we introduced the new deal pilots for people aged 25 and over, in November 1998, we made it clear that we intended the pilots to run for two years, with the last entrants in May 2000. We therefore need to do what another committee under different chairmanship did a year ago: to renew the existing regulations for a further year. I shall briefly outline the key features of the pilots and the progress that they are making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are 28 pilots for people aged 25 or over across Great Britain, and one covering the whole of Northern Ireland, which between them will help 90,000 people. They have been designed to allow us to learn lessons which will inform the future development of help for this group of people. They are aimed principally at people who have been unemployed for 18 months or more, but in some of the pilots we are testing the impact of offering that help earlier to those at, or beyond, the 12-month period of unemployment. In four areas we are also testing the effectiveness of allowing people at a particular disadvantage in the labour market earlier access to the pilots. The pilots are delivered by a variety of public and private sector organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We built a good deal of flexibility into the design of the pilots, so that the provision could be responsive to individual need and local circumstances. Pilot participants initially enter a gateway period of advisory support and other help to find work. Those who do not find work in this gateway period are then required to take part in intensive job search alongside other activity, for example work experience or job-focused training, for up to 13 weeks. During that time, they will receive a grant of up to £200 paid over and above their JSA and other benefits. Those who do not find work by the end of that time are then offered further help in the follow-through period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Initial statistics—I stress that they are initial—show that up to the end of August, more than 54,000 people entered the pilots and at least 7,500 found work, while the majority continue to benefit from the intensive support that is available. The figures are encouraging, but it is too early to make an assessment of the pilots' impact or, indeed, to consider ways in which the approach to delivering help in finding work to this group of people may be refined and developed as the pilots proceed. We have put in place an evaluation strategy to measure the impact of the pilots on those participating in them compared with people outside the pilots. That comparison will in due course enable us to judge the added value of the pilots. However, the main outputs from the evaluation will not be available until next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The renewing regulations that I am proposing today support the pilots in a number of ways. They
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0345">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
prescribe the categories of people who will be required to participate in the new deal pilots and the impact on their benefit of not participating, and they ensure that payments that they may receive as part of the pilot, including self-employed earnings, will not affect their benefit. These regulations simply renew those that were introduced last year to support the pilots, and the amending measures that were introduced in April 1999 to allow pilot participants to begin setting themselves up in business while claiming jobseeker's allowance. A number of minor technical changes have been made to reflect the new arrangements for decision making and appeals and the introduction of the working families tax credit and disabled person's tax credit. We have also added a transitional provision to ensure that participants fall within an uninterrupted regulatory framework.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that these pilots are crucial in helping us determine the shape of future support for adult unemployed people. The regulations give us the power to continue the pilots, as originally planned, so that we have sufficient practical experience on which to draw. I commend them to the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.34 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Bercow 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Buckingham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to be here, supported by my hon. Friends the Members for Spelthorne (Mr. Wilshire) and for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley), for three reasons. The first is that we are meeting under your august chairmanship, Mr. Winterton, 28 years and 39 days after your election as the esteemed Member for Macclesfield on 30 September 1971, which I am sure you remember and of which you are, no doubt, proud. Secondly, it affords me my first opportunity publicly and warmly to congratulate the Minister on her appointment. I wish her every success with what is a challenging responsibility, and I hope that she acquits herself of it well. Thirdly, this is my first Standing Committee on delegated legislation. I hope that hon. Members will not judge that it should also be my last.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It makes sense to consider the regulations together, and I was happy to agree to the Minister's suggestion that we should do so. I should like to deal as briefly as I can with the regulations in turn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I shall deal with the Jobseeker's Allowance Amendment (New Deal) Regulations 1999. The view of the official Opposition is that the regulations are sensible and that they should prove to be uncontroversial. As I want to focus on other matters, I shall resist any temptation to dilate my remarks on them. They make perfectly good sense, and the Opposition do not object to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I turn to the Jobseeker's Allowance (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 1999, about which I echo the Minister's statement. As far as I can discern from study of the regulations, they are guided by three principal motives. None of those motives is exceptionable, and the Opposition agree with all of them. The regulations' first aim is to facilitate smooth transition from incapacity benefit to jobseeker's allowance where such transition is necessary. Why is that smooth transition needed by virtue of the introduction of regulation? The answer is because it
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
does not currently exist. In the past, cases have arisen in which people have not been able to transfer to jobseeker's allowance, unfairly and without the original intention that that should be so. That has occurred principally because such people were not available for work at the relevant time, for the simple reason that they could not expect that they would subsequently be required to have been available for work. It makes obvious sense that the Government should change that state of affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations' second aim, as I understand it, is to allow prisoners released from jail a short period to adjust to civilian life before they make themselves available for work. Their third aim, as the Minister said, is contained in a technical measure that might be described as a cleaning-up operation, which is required because of the changed structure of training and enterprise councils. I refer specifically to the existence of chambers of commerce, training and enterprise. That tidying up is being done elsewhere, and it makes sense to do it in the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus far, and perhaps uncharacteristically, myself individually and the Opposition collectively are in agreement with the Government. Such is our agreement that we could almost—I must not overstate the case—dance round the political mulberry bush together. However, all good things— or, from the vantage point of some hon. Members, all bad things—must of course come to an end. Regrettably, the Opposition are less sanguine about the Social Security (New Deal Pilot) Regulations 1999, although I await with interest the Minister's response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My first concern, which is shared by other Opposition Members, is that the Government's approach seems to put the cart before the proverbial horse. The Committee is being invited to approve the regulations for a second successive year, which will mean that the pilots continue for a second year. However, Ministers have offered a dearth of meaningful information about the operation of the pilots in the first 12 months since they have taken effect. It is frankly risible that Ministers are telling Parliament next to nothing about the performance of the pilots since their advent in November 1998 but expect hon. Members to give the green light for their continuation. I suggest that that is an insult to Parliament and to all those who wish to judge the success or failure of schemes intended to help the long-term unemployed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not cavil at the Minister herself, and I do not blame her. I suspect that she was not personally aware of the decision to pursue the matter in such a way. At any rate, I doubt whether the decision was her inspiration. I am rather inclined instead to blame the dark forces, not of conservatism, but of the Government Whips Office, which seems to think that the process that I have described is an acceptable way to proceed. It is not good enough, however, merely to present hon. Members with a pig in a poke and to expect us to give the silent nod of assent. Such an approach might be acceptable to the pre-programmed robotic tendency in the Government, which I hope will not be represented among Labour Members today. Indeed, I do not think that any of those present falls
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0346">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
into that category. They are all strong-minded and independent spirits capable of expressing themselves forcefully when necessary. Whether the measure is acceptable to Labour Members or not, it is not acceptable to Conservatives. We want to see the evidence before reaching conclusions—that is a commonsense approach. We would like to see evidence in particular regarding the success of the pilots undertaken thus far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that context, I draw the Committee's attention to the preamble to the regulations, in which is used a form of words also used in the preamble to an earlier set of regulations justified by former Ministers to Committees. That part of the preamble reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"will, or will be likely to, encourage persons to obtain work or will, or will be likely to, facilitate the obtaining by persons of work."</p></blockquote>
We shall be delighted if that proves to be the outcome: long-term unemployment is a serious problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An especially grievous difficulty concerns people aged more than 25—and, in some cases, people far older than that—who suffer the indignity and deprivation of long-term unemployment. In so far as Ministers are seeking to remedy that problem—to get people jobs and to increase the likelihood that people will become more employable because of their qualifications and training—we applaud them. We hope, though we are not yet sure, that the specific measures that they commend to the House to achieve that objective will be successful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister rightly highlighted the differences between the pilot projects. There are 28 in Britain, with one covering Northern Ireland. Fourteen of them are for people unemployed for at least 18 months and 10 are for those unemployed for at least 12 months. Four are part of the early-entry experiment to see the effect of the pilots on people unemployed for a shorter period but who suffer a specific disadvantage making it harder for them to find jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We debate the regulations against a significant and serious background. Ministers have celebrated the new deal; the Opposition do not dissent from the sentiments behind it. However, the Minister will know that we believe it to have been long on hype and short, thus far, on delivery. For example, less than a quarter of the people aged 25 or more completing the new deal programme to date have managed to acquire sustained and unsubsidised employment. Moreover, 41 per cent, of that group, regrettably, have left the advisory process for nothing better than the revolving door of continuing benefit dependency. The Committee will be aware that more than 50,000 people have left new deal schemes for what the Government have euphemistically described as unknown destinations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will have done her homework thoroughly and will be aware of the assertions made by the noble Lord Russell in another place on 29 October. He went so far as to assert that only 8 per cent, of those on the new deal aged more than 25 have managed to secure unsubsidised employment to date—one in 12 of participants. I do not know how
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
that compares with the position of those on individual pilots, but I hope that we shall be told.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cotswold) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some information on the debate to which my hon. Friend referred. Lord Russell elicited from a parliamentary question that £114 million from the windfall tax had been allocated to the new deal for the long-term unemployed, of which the pilots under discussion are a component, but only £12 million of that sum had been spent. Are we not entitled to know from the Government what their plans are in that respect?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend that we are entitled to know, and although the noble Lord made inquiries on that subject, the answer from Baroness Blackstone came there little—I put it no more strongly than that. I hope that the Minister will be able to oblige and tell us what is being done, whether the underspend persists, and how she can be confident that value for money is being secured.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to put several inquiries to the Minister because there seem to be several areas in which some clarification and explanation are required. The Minister today asserted, as did Baroness Blackstone, on 29 October 1999, that it was still too early to make any assessment of the efficacy of the pilots. I am concerned that we should be invited to renew the regulations and simply to give the nod to the continuation of the pilots without any evidence about their efficacy thus far. That is a curious way in which to proceed, at least by conventional standards, although perhaps not by the standards of the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Baroness Blackstone and the Minister have said that it is still too early to make any assessment, and the Minister went on to add that the Government have put in place an evaluation strategy. However, the Government also seem to contradict themselves by making much of the fact that 54,000 people have entered the pilots so far, and boasted—singularly inappropriately, it seems to the Opposition—that 7,500 of those people have already secured work. Given that those figures mean that one in seven has so far secured work, I am unsure why Ministers regard that as an occasion for rejoicing. No doubt, we shall be informed of their thinking on this important matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the meanwhile—and while the Minister considers her answer to my inquiry about why one in seven is an unalloyed triumph—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bob Russell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Colchester)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What figure would the hon. Gentleman consider to be a success?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am reluctant to place a figure on it, but one in seven is very poor indeed. If we were to find that, of those leaving, substantially more obtained sustained unsubsidised employment than did not, that would be a success. Of course, in fairness to Ministers, at any time, substantial numbers of people have joined schemes but have not completed their training, although they continue to receive advice, support and encouragement. If the Government are to herald a fanfare of trumpets about the success of their scheme, I believe that of those who leave, more than half
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0347">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
should have obtained sustained unsubsidised employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While the Minister considers why she believes 7,500 people to be a success, perhaps she can also dig out the answer to my next question. The Minister says that 7,500 people out of 54,000 have found jobs, but can she say whether those jobs are in unsubsidised employment? Can she also go so far as to tell the Committee whether those jobs can be considered to be sustainable, and if so, have they been sustained, for how long, and are the Government conducting an on-going analysis of that variable?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My next point relates to an observation by Baroness Blackstone on 29 October. She said—I feel sure that the Committee would like to be favoured with the gist of her remarks—
	<br><blockquote><p>"The number moving in to work each month continues to grow."—[	<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 29 October 1999; Vol. 606, c. 540.]</p></blockquote>
That statement is fairly specific. Will the Minister tell the Committee whether that growth is purely numerical or whether it represents a percentage increase in the number of people who are obtaining unsubsidised employment? The fact that the numbers are increasing, month by month, is a wholly unremarkable state of affairs. Obviously, if more and more people join the scheme, it is likely that, over a period of time, the numbers who obtain work will tend to increase, almost regardless of the efficacy of the schemes, simply on the basis of the balance of probability. We need to know whether the proportion of people who are finding jobs is increasing and, at the risk of reminding the Minister too many times, whether those people are entering unsubsidised employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My beady eye alighted on the term "intensive activity", in the regulations. Those who take part in the pilots are expected to engage in such activity as a condition of their continued receipt of jobseeker's allowance. If they decline to participate in such activity—or, having started, cease to do so—they are at risk of withdrawal of benefit. I do not cavil at that; the Opposition believe that when help is being offered to people who will otherwise be a claim on the taxpayer and learning nothing, they should be a claim on the taxpayer but learning something. If they decline to learn something, there is good reason why they should not be allowed to continue to be a drain on the taxpayer. However, what constitutes intensive activity for the purposes of the regulations?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is simply not good enough for Ministers, guided by those who know in their Departments, to argue in favour of maximum flexibility in the regulations. If we are invited to approve the regulations, we need to know what the wording contained therein means. What does intensive activity denote?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My next inquiry relates to the collation and publication of statistics, and the broad theme of whether the pilots are successful. The Department publishes monthly figures on the new deal, but not monthly figures on the efficacy of the pilots—the proportion of people entering work, rejoining the benefit culture, going to destinations unknown, and so
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
forth. However, this Committee, sitting in solemn conclave this afternoon, is invited to reach its verdict on whether the regulations allowing the pilots should be renewed. Do the Government plan to publish figures specifically for the pilots? I sense the twitching brow of my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown), the Whip who must be obeyed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a note from the Library that tells me that officials from the Department have visited all the pilots to assess their effectiveness, but that the results of those visits are not to be deposited in the Library. Does my hon. Friend think that if officials have visited the pilots, we ought to have access to the results?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As usual, my hon. Friend anticipates my later thoughts. There is nothing new in that; I am accustomed to my hon. Friend being some steps ahead of me—the Committee will probably assent to that verdict. I entirely agree with him, and feel the itch to dilate on that point in a minute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What interested me as much as anything about the subject was the fact that, some time ago, the Department for Education and Employment issued a press release which, among other things, referred to the "high quality" of the schemes. We were invited to believe that they represented an up-market initiative which—for this Government cannot be accused of underselling themselves, or hiding their light under a bushel—
	<br><blockquote><p>"sets it apart from previous schemes."</p></blockquote>
My inquiry about that is obvious: how do the Government know that the pilot schemes are high quality, and that the schemes set themselves apart from previous schemes, if the evaluation has not been completed, debated and published? That is an extraordinary state of affairs. If the press release had expressed the hope—an altogether more modest statement—that the schemes would be of high quality and would set themselves apart from their predecessors, that would have been acceptable. However, it is rum, to put it mildly, that in a Government press release issued by the Department for Education and Employment at the expense of the beleaguered taxpayer, Ministers should proclaim the schemes' success before their evaluation—indeed, before they have even got properly under way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now I come to the crucial subject of the long-awaited, eagerly anticipated evaluation of the schemes. I want to know—and I suspect that the Committee will be keen to discover—who will undertake the evaluation. In the Committee that debated the Draft Social Security (New Deal Pilot) Amendment Regulations 1999 on 17 March this year, the Under-Secretary of State for Social Security, the hon. Member for Wallasey (Angela Eagle) said—in response, if I remember correctly, to some probings from my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Mr. Collins)—that the evaluation of the pilot regulations would be "independent, transparent and publishable". That is very interesting; we must explore those concepts, for they are concepts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, what is meant by independent? Who will conduct the evaluation? To whom will they report?
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0348">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
Secondly, given that the evaluation is to be transparent, can we now be told of the interim findings of those charged with conducting the evaluation? If not, and if, to pick up on the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold, we are not entitled at this stage to see the initial reports on the pilot schemes, in what sense does the Under-Secretary's word on that occasion hold good? How can the evaluations possibly be considered transparent?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, I notice that the Under-Secretary used the word "publishable" rather than "published". At that stage, the reports were obviously not to be published; she was indicating merely that they were capable of publication. I understand that there have been, as my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold poignantly observed, visits by officials to the pilots and that what are described as initial reports have been made on them, but I hope that the Minister will agree that we need to know more than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How many reports have there been? When were they undertaken? Has she seen their findings or does she know what they are? Has she asked questions about them? Has she made any visits to the pilots themselves? What are the criteria by which the success or failure of those pilots will be evaluated? In particular—I am sure that my hon. Friends would agree that this is the nub of the matter—does the Minister agree that at least one, and possibly the most important, of the criteria is whether the schemes are effective in reducing long-term unemployment and getting the long-term jobless off benefit and into sustainable employment? If they pass that test, we can have a second dance around the political mulberry bush as we congratulate Ministers on their prescience and wisdom and on the efficacy of the schemes and the value for money that they have secured. I say that sincerely. If, on the other hand, the schemes have not achieved that, they will have failed on the crucial test.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Wilshire 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Spelthorne)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is in a particularly charitable mood this afternoon, but I wonder whether he would, on reflection, consider adding to the list of questions that he posed to the Minister another, crucial question: will the Minister publish these reports, and if so, when, and if not, why not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right and I apologise to him; it is an abiding failing of mine that I tend to err on the side of being charitable. I am doing my best to address that besetting tendency and I am genuinely grateful to my hon. Friend for encouraging me to be a little more stringent in my treatment of Ministers. He is right. Will the reports be published and, if so, when? Will they be debated in Parliament and, if so, when? If not, why not? Moreover, if the reports are not to be published, why does the Minister expect us to allow the regulations to go through on the nod?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be delighted if the schemes were successful. The hon. Member for Colchester (Mr. Russell) challenged me as to what would constitute success and I gave an off-the-cuff response, based on
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
reasonableness and common sense, as to what I thought would be a yardstick by which they could be judged. I cannot see why the Department for Education and Employment apparently does not intend to place copies of the initial reports in the Library. I may have been misinformed about that, but I was advised by someone whom I regarded as an estimable source that the initial reports were not to be deposited there. I do not know why that is the case, but no doubt the Minister will provide the answer. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The game is up; my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold pointed out from a sedentary position that the source of that information was no lesser an authority than Mr. Timothy Jarvis of the Library. If my hon. Friend is right, I am sure that Mr. Jarvis will not object to being cited about that. However, I want to know why we should not have the information and if we can have it, when.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister rightly commented on the 28 individual schemes, but I should be grateful if she told us a little more about the variations between them. Have visitors to them noted differences between those that are private-sector led and those that are not? What form do the differences take?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers have said a good deal about the important self-employment option, which we take seriously. Will the Minister speak about its efficacy so far? How many people on that option have come off it and into sustained and unsubsidised employment?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further inquiry—whether those schemes are obliged to present full business plans in the first instance—occurs to me. It was made many months ago by my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale, but no reply was received. If the schemes are so obliged, are the plans approved in advance by the Minister? Are they deposited in the Library at the time? If not, are they available now? Can we study them? If so, why was the opportunity to do so not given in advance of the Committee's deliberations?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We come to the subject with an open mind. We are not prepared to make precipitate judgments. We have expressed our concern that the new deal is an expensive white elephant that thus far has done little more than spray cold water over the legitimate hopes and aspirations of thousands of long-term unemployed people the length and breadth of Britain. We do not see evidence that the scheme as a whole is successful; we see powerful evidence of continuing dependency, a mismatch between vacancies and candidates, a heavy deadweight cost and poor performance following high-falutin' ministerial rhetoric.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that things are going to get better, especially given the arrival of the new Minister, whom I warmly welcomed at the outset and to whom that welcome still extends. Performance might improve, the number of people going to unknown destinations might fall, the number of people going through the revolving door of benefit dependency might decline and the number of people going to the shining upland of sustained and unsubsidised employment might correspondingly increase. I hope that that will be so, but it is not yet clear that it will be. Ministers have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0349">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
regrettably declined us the chance to consider the evidence, examine the body and pronounce our verdict.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have put to the Minister a series of entirely reasonable questions. I know from her facility on other occasions that she will be ready with full, detailed and comprehensive responses, which my hon. Friends and I await with interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.13 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Wilshire 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Spelthorne)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My starting point must be to congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham as, quite modestly, he congratulated everyone except himself. He explained that his speech was his first on a Committee considering delegated legislation; it most certainly will not be his last, judging from its excellence. In the short term, the Government can rest assured that they shall hear a great deal more from him and, next time, when they see that he is leading for the Opposition they should come with the answers ready rather than having to have them dragged from them. In the long term, Government Members will hear a great deal more from him as a successful Minister when they sit on the Opposition Benches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to repeat the general points that my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham made, as he made them much more eloquently than I could. I simply agree with them. He explained that he considered the first and second regulations sensible. I always find it difficult to use that word when discussing anything that the present Government have done, so I will settle for the word tolerable to describe those regulations. Therefore, I do not want to pursue debate on them either.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also want to say something about the longest of the three measures: the Social Security (New Deal Pilot) Regulations 1999. My hon. Friend made the important general points that need to be made and asked the important general questions that the Minister must answer. I would prefer to be slightly more parochial, because each member of the Committee, whatever our party persuasion, has a constituency interest in these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore looked with interest at the pilot areas. I studied them most carefully, but there is nothing in the paperwork that I was sent before the sitting, or which was waiting for me today, that explains why these pilot areas were chosen and why others were left out. If I am to make a judgment on behalf of my constituents, I need to know whether it is right that the Spelthorne constituency does not figure or whether there is some reason why I should be arguing for its inclusion. I had hoped that the Minister could tell me why the Staines jobcentre is not there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
References to anywhere in the south east of England is very hard to find in the schedules. London and the south east is mentioned, but only London jobcentres are listed. My hon. Friend the Member for Bury St. Edmunds has returned to the Committee just in time for me to say that he is either very lucky or very unfortunate that the Bury St. Edmunds job centre is listed. I want to find out whether he is lucky or unfortunate. That is why I want
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
to know why Staines jobcentre is not there. Perhaps I could be told.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Look as I may, the only area that is of specific local interest to me is in schedule 2 regulation 4, which refers to London and the south east. Under that heading, at the bottom of the first page, is a reference to Ealing, Hillingdon, Hounslow and Richmond, all of which are in the greater London area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I find interesting is that Feltham, Hounslow, and Twickenham jobcentres appear on the list. All three jobcentres are sufficiently close to the Spelthorne constituency for some of my constituents to go there looking for opportunities. Should I, therefore, be concerned that it is an advantage to my constituents to go to Feltham, Hounslow or Twickenham? Alternatively, is it a disadvantage that they have to go there in order to see whether they can benefit in any way from these schemes? If there is a benefit from being able to reach those three jobcentres from my constituency, would the Minister care to tell me whether those of my constituents who live in the west of my constituency, and therefore find it difficult to get to Feltham, Hounslow and Twickenham and have to make do with Staines, are at a disadvantage compared to some of the others? If so, I fail to see why my constituents should be treated as two different groups of people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham is absolutely right: whether or not there is a constituency interest, whether my constituents are better or worse off being outside the pilot scheme, based on the information given to us thus far I do not see how any member of the Committee can make an informed judgment about whether we should allow the scheme to go ahead for another year. It is an absolute disgrace when Governments, of whatever political persuasion, come to Parliament and say, "We're going to tell you nothing; just rubber stamp it." Well, I am not one for rubber stamping it. Unless I get a decent explanation, I will contemplate voting against the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was expecting more contributions, but in their absence, I shall try to do justice to the Opposition's questions However, we should be clear about one thing: had the employment prospects of young or older people who face long-term unemployment been left to the Opposition, nothing would have been done. They have consistently attacked the new deal, which they would not have introduced, and the benefits that are being received by young and older people across the county—many of whom are in work for the first time in their life—would not have been realised.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Part of my purpose was to put it on the record that assessments must be objective and not based on sentiment.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In dealing with the welter of the Opposition's questions on evaluation and whether the pilots have successfully achieved their objectives, I shall attempt to construct a reasonable and logical response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first question of the hon. Member for Spelthorne concerned the criteria that were adopted to choose the areas. It may help him to know that the design document that set out the operation of the new deal pilots dealt with the selection of the 28 areas. In essence, there was a competition between areas, and points were awarded on the basis of quality, innovation and value for money. If he is worried that there is no new deal for a 25-plus pilot in his constituency, he may want to approach people in his area to discover whether they submitted a bid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me turn to the important issue of evaluation. We must get away from the suggestion that the determination to establish whether the pilots work and deliver their objectives is the property of the Opposition. We are piloting this approach to understand how, in practice, we can extend the opportunity of employment to people aged 25 and over. Many of those people have been unemployed for much of their life and face intractable personal difficulties. Their employment record, if they have one, may be poor. I hope that no one underestimates the amount of support and supervision that they will need to get from unemployment to sustained employment. The Government are determined to do everything that we can to find the answers to those questions. We have therefore undertaken both qualitative and quantitative evaluation. The qualitative evaluation is being undertaken by the National Centre for Social Research, and a consortium of research institutes are involved in it. They include the much-respected Policy Studies Institute, the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, which is considering macro-economic effects, and others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy to provide to the Committee the broad framework within which the evaluation objectives are set. I do not expect them to come as any surprise to anybody. The central question is measurement of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the approaches tested in the pilot in getting people into work. Is this a successful and effective way of getting people who are currently unemployed into work? I am speaking not only of getting them into work, but of keeping them there, across a range of labour markets and delivery models.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to measure the costs and benefits of intervening at 12 months and at 18 months, which are the two time frames set by the pilot. We want to measure the effectiveness of our approach in helping older people—the new deal for the 50-plus was announced last week by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Employment. We want to consider the read-across between the new deal 25-plus pilot and our approaches to helping older people back into work. We want to establish more clearly the nature of barriers to employment that people face.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
Obviously, as I have made clear and the Opposition have perhaps made even clearer, we are still in the early days. Of course officials have visited all the pilots, and some of the information derived from them will shortly be placed on the internet. Such visits are part of official oversight, and involve learning as we go along—that is not evaluation. If money is invested in professional and respected organisations to evaluate a programme, they should be allowed to get on and do it. One should not try to intervene before the evaluation period is complete.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister allow me?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it helps the hon. Gentleman, I am happy to ensure that hon. Members who wish to receive information about visits to pilots are able to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, has the Minister seen the interim reports submitted by officials or others who have visited the pilots?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly come to deal with that point, if the hon. Gentleman will contain his soul in patience.

I look forward to doing so, and I should be happy to be accompanied on those visits by any hon. Members who wish to join me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilshire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sympathise with the right hon.

However, if I understand her correctly, she says that she has not yet seen all the evidence collected from the evaluation of the projects. If that is so, how can she come to the Committee this afternoon with confidence to ask us to renew the scheme, claiming it to be a success?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Precisely because, when we established the new deal pilots, we said clearly that to derive results that we could regard as reliable, they would have to run for two years.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilshire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I hear correctly, this is going from bad to worse.

If the Government knew that they were carrying out a two-year project, why in heaven's name did they not produce legislation to enable it to run for two years?

	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
me try to soothe him with the reassurance that it was always our intention that the pilots should run for two years. There are already early indications—but I make no over-claim for them—that in pilot areas, compared to other parts of the country, more people are going into jobs. I make no greater claim than that, because we want the pilots to be properly evaluated and to have confidence in our conclusions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If anyone could soothe the Committee, it would be the right hon. Lady. Unfortunately, as my hon. Friend the Member for Spelthorne observed, things are proceeding from bad to worse. First, the right hon. Lady says that there is evidence that people on pilots are doing better than those who are not on them. What are the figures? It will not do to give us a sort of rhetorical titbit or a political nudge and wink, and invite us to rest content on the strength of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilshire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is called spin.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Spin, as my hon. Friend says from a sedentary position. What are the figures?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, does the Minister accept that her observation in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Spelthorne was logically flawed? She said that she could be confident about the procedure because the trial was for two years. The fact that a trial is for two years proves nothing. It is perfectly possible for the result of the trial to be successful; it is equally possible for it to be unsuccessful. If, against the Minister's expectations and spin, it is unsuccessful, will she resign?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With great respect, we are considering an important matter: the employment prospects of people, many of whom have been without work. What we are hearing from the Opposition is little more than trivial farce. I will continue to answer their many questions to the very best of my ability, from the information available to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may help the hon. Member for Spelthorne further by reminding him that the Jobseekers Act 1995, which is the primary legislation from which the regulations derive, and which passed under his Government, restricted pilots to 12 months. We are seeking to extend them for a further 12 months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the figures, and to the number of people who have moved from benefit into work. Let me provide the background facts about the 25-plus new deal pilots.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Twenty-eight.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The 28 pilots for 25-plus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are investing slightly more than £137 million over the lifetime of this Parliament and we have established 28 pilots, of which 18 are partnerships and 10 are private-sector led. They were launched successfully at the end of last November, offering 60,000 places in Great Britain and 30,000 in Northern Ireland. To the end of August 1999, there have been just over 54,000 starts on the pilots—that is, people coming off benefit and into the pilot—including slightly more than 15,000 in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To the end of August 1999, 7,500 people had found jobs. More than 90 per cent, of those jobs are
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
unsubsidised and all are sustained, which means that they have lasted for more than 13 weeks. Yes, we are deeply concerned that they should be sustained jobs. We work with employers to ensure that, and we ensure, through a period of intense activity, that those new dealers who come on to the 25-plus programme have the benefit of intensive support for the 13-week period. There is a clear regime and sufficient flexibility to meet their different experiences and needs, as well as the recognition that people need different kinds of help. We believe that the curriculum for those 13 weeks is best determined locally to ensure that local unemployed people are, wherever possible, matched for jobs for which there are local vacancies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We are renewing the regulations this afternoon to ensure that a major pilot programme that was established to run for two years is able to run for the full period and can be properly evaluated so that we can learn its lessons and apply them to people without jobs who want to work but who are unlikely to get into work without the kind of sustained, intensive and highly personalised help that the pilots are developing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are clear choices. We have offered a new deal to unemployed people. The Opposition have offered no deal. They have instead offered trivia, carping and ludicrous criticism of a programme about which no Labour Member is remotely defensive. Our only determination is that it works for both young and older people who seek work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.39 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As ever, my hon. Friend the Member for Spelthorne asks a pertinent question, the reply to which was provided from a sedentary position by the hon. Member for Colchester, who averred that Labour Back Benchers had not contributed because the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts)—the Government Whip: he who must be obeyed—is present. Labour Back Benchers are clearly exhorted not to contribute. That is not to say that they heckled the Minister; they did not. I am sure that they extend kindly congratulations to her on her new post. However, they are not exactly jumping up and down in exultant praise of her ministrations. Indeed, they seem to have had nothing to say. We do not expect the hon. Member for Dunfermline, West (Ms Squire) to have anything to say, because it is not her place in these proceedings to do so. But considering the

	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
number of veritable firebrands on the Labour Back Benches, not least the hon. Member for Cleethorpes (Shona McIsaac) and the hon. Member for Waveney (Mr. Blizzard), who regularly favours us with his lucubrations in the Chamber, I should have thought that one or other of those fine denizens of our House of Commons would have risen to their feet to proclaim support for the Government. They did not do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members started with an open mind not only on the issue but on whether to support the regulations, to abstain or to vote against them. I waited in eager anticipation, with beads of sweat on my brow, to hear the Minister's justification of the Government's position, which she always gives with style and charm, and some eloquence. However, I am sorry to say that she has provided a risible response to the legitimate inquiries that my hon. Friend the Member for Spelthorne and I have made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government admit that they have no robust figures to demonstrate the pilots' success so far. I use the word "robust" advisedly, because the Minister repeated figures given in the other place by the noble Baroness Blackstone—7,500 out of 54,000—of participants in the pilots who have secured jobs. However, I am sure that the right hon. Lady will accept that in academic terms that does not constitute a robust finding. Ministers accept that robust findings are not yet available, because the evaluation has not been completed. Simply to toss that figure into the air—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman cannot have it both ways. He is turning a debate about unemployment and young people into something of a comedy turn. He cannot on one hand say that the figures that I have offered to the Committee and in which I have confidence are not robust, because the evaluation is still to be completed, and on the other hand plead that the regulations are unnecessary, as is the evaluation, and that we should proceed without it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that the right hon. Lady has misunderstood my point. I do not suggest that we should proceed without evaluation. She does not seem to comprehend that, before we give the green light and allow the second tranche of the pilots for the ensuing year to proceed, we should have some robust evidence of their success thus far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to say that I genuinely object to the Minister's tone. She said that we had descended to a level of trivial farce. Not only is that wrong, but it says something significant about the Government's—the Executive's—attitude to our legislature. That is what Ministers think of the House of Commons. So drunk are they with their own power and with the enormous advantage that their 180-seat majority has conferred on them that they consider it entirely commonplace to come to the House, steamroller through their proposals, brook no dissent, hear no comment and insist on the robotic tendency doing exactly what the Government want without even expressing an opinion. If an hon. Member—from any party, even from the official Opposition—dares to cavil at the success, as they perceive it, to ask questions and to suggest that all
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
might not be well, that there are legitimate grounds for criticism and that it is procedurally improper to expect our assent without any evidence of the efficacy of the schemes that they are commending, they take umbrage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I have never seen evidence that the Minister is personally arrogant or discourteous either to the House or to the Committee, the Government—especially the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe—are guilty of arrogance and discourtesy to the House and the Committee in simply expecting the regulations to pass on the nod. They will not do so, as long as my hon. Friends and I are here to represent the Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilshire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I agree with my hon. Friend. Would he care to speculate on what my constituents will think when I tell them that attending the Committee this afternoon and asking whether or not the interests of the constituents of Spelthorne are being properly looked after has been described as trivial?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to establish whether the schemes are successful. I am sorry that the Minister chose to impugn our motives by suggesting that we were treating the matter trivially and implying that we did not care and could not give a tinker's cuss about the success of the schemes or the interests of the long-term unemployed. I care about those interests, and I accept that the Minister cares about them as well. The issue is not about who cares but about what works. Before we are invited to give our parliamentary assent to the schemes' continuation, we are at least entitled to have sight of the interim reports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister were to have taken a different tack, she might have done better with my hon. Friends and me. If she had said, "We hope that the Committee will consider the interim reports, which we have made available, and will accept that they are not the final verdict and that they might have to be amended, but they are a reasonable guide to the schemes' success so far" and if she had said, "We as a Government have thought it right and proper to provide the Committee in advance with the evidence and the initial assessments", I should have thought it an indication of good intent. It would have been an elementary courtesy for the Department for Education and Employment to have provided us with the evidence of the interim reports, either by publishing them—I do not understand why they should not be published—or, at least, by providing a detailed and succinct summary of their content.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am now advised that the Minister has not seen the reports. The hon. Member for Colchester—an emblem of reasonableness most, if not all, of the time—asked a simple question: are the private-sector led projects doing better than the others—yea or nay—or are they doing the same, to which the Minister replied that she would be happy to provide that information. We are grateful to her for being willing to do so, but we do not want the information next week, next month, or next year; we want it before we vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In fact, I understand that, as yet, no discernible or clear distinction exists between the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0353">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
public-sector partnerships and the private-sector partnerships. Of course, the impact of different labour markets in different parts of the country will have to be weighted in the evaluation. I would not want to mislead the Committee with premature conclusions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bercow</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for sharing that fact with the Committee. My hon. Friends and I did not know that, nor did the hon. Member for Colchester, but she has suddenly become aware of that fact, by whatever means. However, I am afraid that this is all of a piece. We know that 28 schemes are operational; we know that they fall into three categories, but we know precious little beyond that. I am sorry to insist that we are being presented with a pig in a poke and invited to give our silent nod of assent. That would be unsatisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister admits that she does not know whether the schemes are successful. She says that the fact that an evaluation is in place will show whether they are successful and expresses her confidence that they will be because the yardsticks are sound and well designed. But we do not know whether the schemes will be successful. I care passionately that the long-term unemployed, who in some cases are suffering, through no fault of their own, on the margins of society, are reintegrated into society and trained well so that they have good skills. Getting them ready for the labour market is a critical part of that process and Ministers are embarked on a perfectly honourable mission. However, I repeat that we are not talking about good intentions and whether the Minister means well. We are talking about evidence. Do the schemes work? Do they provide value for money? Is there any discernible statistical benefit to those who take part in the schemes relative to those who do not?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are absolutely critical questions for elected members of our legislature to ask and for Ministers to answer—without complaint. I am sorry to conclude
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
that, on the basis of the Minister's response, none of the satisfactory answers for which I had hoped has been provided. It is in the interests of the long-term unemployed, of socially inclusive policies and of the success of welfare-to-work, rather than work-to-welfare, that we should have distinctive and persuasive answers to those and other inquiries. In their absence, I must press the matter to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
