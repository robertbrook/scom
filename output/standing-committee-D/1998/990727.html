Education (Head Teachers) Regulations 1999</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Clappison <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hertsmere)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,<br><br>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Education (Head Teachers Regulations 1999 (S.I. 1999, No. 1287).</p></blockquote>
May I say at the outset what a great pleasure it is to serve under you again, Mr. O'Hara, to consider this important piece of secondary legislation in respect of which several questions arise. Those questions arise for me as a layperson in the matter. The majority of members of the Committee are laypersons—although at least one may be able to give us some expert views as a former head teacher. The statutory instrument will be of interest to head teachers in schools throughout the country as well as to governing bodies and parents.<br><br>
This secondary legislation is consequent on provisions in the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 covering schools with head teachers for separate departments within a school—schools that are divided into junior and infant departments. Under the 1998 Act, schools will be unable to appoint separate head teachers for junior and infant departments in one school. Only one head may now be appointed.<br><br>
The statutory instrument concerns transitional arrangements for schools organised in separate departments with head teachers for each department. Under regulation 3, no new heads of department are to be appointed and no schools are to be reorganised into separate departments with separate head teachers. When a post of head teacher of a department becomes vacant, that post will cease to exist and there will be a single head teacher. Under regulation 4, schools organised into departments with two head teachers may continue with separate head teachers for the time being or until one of them retires. Regulation 5 deals with the appointment of a single head teacher when one falls to be appointed.<br><br>
We have several questions about the statutory instrument. Will the Minister tell us how many schools are covered by the regulations—how many schools are organised in separate departments with separate head teachers? That is an interesting starting point.<br><br>
We are told that there is protection for schools that have two head teachers, unless one of the posts becomes vacant, and that that protection will run from 1 September this year until immediately before the relevant date. Will the Minister say a little more about the relevant date—the date on which schools can no longer be organised in separate departments and can no longer exist in their present form? What is the Government's thinking on when the relevant date
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
might be and are there any circumstances that will determine when the relevant date will be fixed?<br><br>
We should like to know more about the procedures for appointing a single head teacher under regulation 5. We have been told that if one head retires or leaves, the governing body or the local education authority may appoint the remaining head as head teacher of the whole school to cover both departments. What will happen when the head of a junior school retires or leaves but the head of the infant school does not want to take responsibility for the whole school? What will be the remaining head's job? Will he or she remain on a preserved salary with preserved pension rights? What authority will that person have in his or her department as a head who has stayed on but who has chosen not to apply for the post of single head? Will it be possible to adopt a straightforward teaching role or will there be other responsibilities? What role will that person have in the school of which he or she was formerly a head teacher?<br><br>
Where do deputy head teachers fit in? If the post of a single head teacher is established in a school that has deputy head teachers in separate departments, will the deputies retain the role of deputy head? What will happen to a deputy head teacher if a remaining head of a department declines to seek appointment to the post of single head but stays on in his or her school in a new role? Will the deputy head remain in post beneath the remaining head, or will the deputy head have authority over the remaining head? That will interest both deputy heads and head teachers.<br><br>
In the same vein, what will happen to the head teacher's role as a governor if a head teacher stays on in his or her department without becoming the head of the whole school? That is of particular interest to head teachers who, under the old arrangements, are school governors. When the post of one of the heads becomes vacant and the other decides not to apply for the post of single head, will the remaining head teacher continue to be a member of the governing body even though he or she is no longer a head and has a new role?<br><br>
Finally, what representations have been received by the Government on the transitional provisions? I appreciate that they are transitional measures to protect the role of head teachers under the new arrangements but, having combed through debates on legislation that established the framework for single heads for two departments, I realise that this issue has not been ventilated at great length in the House, although it is of interest to many people outside. Perhaps the Minister will say more about that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Foster <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I just remind the hon. Gentleman that during the Committee stage of the School Standards and Framework Bill, we were given an assurance by the then Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment, the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Ms Morris), that there would be consultation? She said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We shall report to the House on that consultation."—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 10 February 1998; c. 439.]</p></blockquote>
Is he aware of the House being given information on that consultation?</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can only say to the hon. Gentleman that, having combed through the maze of regulations, including statutory instruments, I know that the subject has not been ventilated at great length. Perhaps the Minister will take this opportunity to say more about that, as well as answering the detailed questions that legitimately arise from the statutory instrument.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Is this an intervention?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have finished my speech, Mr. O'Hara.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I call the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis).</span> </p>
<p>10.40 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not realise that the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) had finished, Mr. O'Hara. I welcome you to the Chair, and I hope that after these speedy Committee proceedings you will have an excellent holiday. I wish the Minister well in the reshuffle later today, and I trust that his efforts in the Department will be rewarded.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stephen Pound <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ealing, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Get on with it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his encouragement, given in the holiday spirit.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere was right in saying that I have not only a personal interest in this matter, but personal experience. In 1992, I was head teacher of a high school on a site that also contained a middle school undergoing reorganisation under the previous Government's reorganisation plans. I was appointed head of the new school and took on 60 new staff: three deputies and five senior teachers, not one of whom was appointed either by myself, the remains of the management team or the governors. That was completely unacceptable, and we are pleased that the Government have tightened up the regulations regarding reorganisation, especially this thorny issue concerning schools in which two departments are on the same site. That issue needed to be dealt with and we are broadly supportive of the thrust of the Government's aims.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) makes the valid point that we were promised consultation on the matter. I spoke to the head teachers' associations yesterday, none of which has been formally consulted. To be fair to the Minister, that is not the way in which the he normally works. I hope that it was an oversight rather than a change of policy, as there is normally good consultation with the bodies whose members are directly affected.<br><br>
I will not repeat the questions raised by the hon. Member for Hertsmere, because he has mentioned most of the issues that we wanted to raise. However, one further matter that concerns us is the appointment of a single head teacher covered in paragraphs (2) and (3) of regulation 5. The opening sentence of both
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
paragraphs contains the word "may". Regulation 5(2) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The governing body of an aided or a voluntary aided school may, after consulting the local education authority, appoint the sole remaining head teacher".</p></blockquote>
Regulation 5(3) goes on:
<br><blockquote><p>"The local education authority may on the recommendation of the governing body…appoint the sole remaining head teacher".</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister explain the significance of the word "may"? It seems to suggest that there will be conditions attached to the governing body's ability to appoint. In that case, will there be specific criteria for the appointment of the sole remaining head teacher? If so, who will establish them? Will it be the governing body, the local education authority or the Secretary of State?<br><br>
Conversely, what will be the criteria for not appointing? There will be occasions on which a deliberate decision will be taken not to appoint, because the governing body feels that the remaining head teacher is not the right person for the post. What will the criteria be in such cases, and who will establish them?<br><br>
If the head teacher of a section of the school wanted to be the head teacher but was deemed by the governing body and/or the LEA not to be the right person for the position, would he or she be subject to redundancy or dismissal? The hon. Member for Hertsmere asked about the protection that he or she would thereafter receive. The school might be placed in an impossible situation. Committee members who have worked in schools know how difficult it is when a member of staff is overlooked for a promotion, but more pressing difficulties arise when an acting head does not get the job that he or she wanted.<br><br>
We are generally happy with the thrust of the Government's approach in this regard—it makes sound sense, and we wish them well.</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Charles Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had a useful discussion. When the hon. Member for Hertsmere welcomed the debate, I thought for a moment that we should have to speak in Latin, in deference to your mastery of the subject, Mr. O'Hara. I am glad that we did not do that—it would have caused me some difficulty. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Hertsmere, who accurately summed up the regulations, and to the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough for his support.<br><br>
I shall summarise the present situation. The School Standards and Framework Act 1998 specifically states that there should be one head of a school. It clearly set out that requirement among the provisions relating to a head teacher's responsibilities. For example, section 6 states that LEAs can consult the head teacher of each school that it maintains about the authority's education development plan. Section 15 states that the head can be given a copy of an LEA's warning notice that the school is causing concern. Section 19 states that the Secretary of State shall give notice to the head if the Secretary of State uses his power to direct the closure of the school. Section 38 deals with the way in which roles, responsibilities and functions are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0635">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
conferred on governing bodies and head teachers—those roles, responsibilities and functions relate to the whole school, not to parts of it. Sections 49, 50 and 52 set out the head teacher's financial responsibilities. Section 61 contains the head teacher's responsibilities for discipline and behaviour, and sections 64 to 68 contain his or her power to exclude pupils. Section 127 concerns his or her relations with the LEA, and paragraph 8 of schedule 9 allows the head teacher to be treated as an ex officio governor.<br><br>
Committee members have pointed out that the intentions of the 1998 Act have been fully discussed and that the head teacher's role is extremely important to a school. There is a consensus between the Government and the Opposition on the fact that the role of the head teacher is exceptionally important in ensuring that schools perform effectively. The purpose of the 1998 Act was to establish and to clarify the relevant arrangements.<br><br>
The purpose of the regulations is purely transitional. They take account of the fact that, for various reasons, some schools have two heads. It would be wrong to disrupt that arrangement unnecessarily. Likewise, it would be wrong to deviate from Parliament's main intentions when it passed the 1998 Act.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere asked a perfectly fair question about the number of schools that will be affected by the proposals. We know that a small minority of schools will be affected, but we have not carried out surveys across the country to establish an exact figure. I cannot answer his question with a figure, but I can tell him that although substantial numbers are not involved, the issue is a real one, which makes the regulations necessary. I am sorry not to be more precise. <br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also asked about the phrase, "the relevant date", which is contained in regulation 1. It states that protection is available between 1 September 1999 and "the relevant date". The relevant date is defined in regulation 2, which states:
<br><blockquote><p>'"relevant date' means the date on or after 1st September 1999 on which the first of the head teachers of a relevant school to cease to be a head teacher of the school ceases to be such a head 1 teacher".</p></blockquote>
The relevant date is the point at which one of the two head teachers resigns, retires or by any other means leaves his or her post. I hope that that clarifies the meaning of the phrase.<br><br>
In response to the hon. Gentleman's probing, I should make it clear that we do not intend to change the regulation in order to impose a "relevant date", which would be ex cathedra and would not have regard to the particular circumstances of particular schools. The period is that between 1 September this year and the date of a teacher's resignation, retirement or whatever it may be. I hope that that clarifies matters for the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere secondly raised the question, in relation to regulation 5, of the procedures for dealing with a single head when the remaining head does not want to proceed or does not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
want the other job. It is a worthwhile point, which also relates to that raised by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough. The governing body has a choice when one of the two heads leaves. The first option is to appoint the sole remaining head to the headship of the whole school. The second option is to advertise the post as head of the whole school, and to invite applications more widely through the normal process. That is the context in which I can give the clarification for which the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough asked on the meaning of the word "may". It means that the LEA of a maintained school—or the governing body of a voluntary school—is permitted to keep one of the two heads on as the head of the new school. I am sure that the latin variance relating to "may" and "is permitted to" could entertain the Committee for some time, Mr. O'Hara, with your expert guidance. The governing body will take various issues into consideration. In some cases it will decide that the existing head is the right person to be appointed, and that advertisement is not necessary. In other cases it will decide to advertise in order to obtain a full field of applicants. I acknowledge the point made by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough that serious issues are involved in such a decision. Every governing body will have to weigh carefully the merits of each course of action, in the light of attitudes, approaches and considerations within the school.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister assure us that the LEA will not have a right of veto over the governors' decision in any circumstance?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I can give such an assurance. I am struggling slightly on this point, but, in the case of maintained schools, I think that LEAs have the right to take a decision on which course of action should be followed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: <i>indicated dissent.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Bath believes that they do not have such a right. I shall take advice on that point, and write to the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough to clarify the matter. However, there is no intention to change the existing legal responsibilities of the governing body, vis-a-vis the LEA, on that matter. The matter will be decided in the routine way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had also spotted the word "may", which I understood broadly in the way in which the Minister has described. Do not paragraphs (2) and (3) of regulation 5 draw a distinction between different types of schools? In some schools, the governors, after consulting the local education authority, appoint the head. In the other type of school, the local education authority, on the recommendation of the governing body, appoints the head.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The reason for that distinction is the different legal roles of the governing body, vis-a-vis the LEA, in the different types of school.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, the Minister might want to take advice on this point, as he rightly said. When the appointment of head teachers was discussed during consideration of the School Standards and Framework Bill, one of the significant debates in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0636">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
Committee related to the LEA's ability to be involved in that appointment. As I understand it—I shall stand corrected I am wrong—the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 states that the final decision on the appointment of a head teacher rests, even in an LEA-maintained school, with the governing body, and that the LEA can only express a view on the matter. That was of real concern to the Opposition during the passage of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I entirely understand the hon. Gentleman's point. That is the Government's intention—his understanding of the Act is correct. He set out the position clearly. I was trying to disentangle—unsuccessfully, it seems—the various roles of the LEA and the governing body in the particular circumstances to which the legislation relates.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If my understanding is correct and if the Minister's suggestions are correct, then, under regulation 5(3),
<br><blockquote><p>"The local education authority may on the recommendation of the governing body"—</p></blockquote>
do x, y and z; the LEA has no choice whatever in the matter. If a particular decision was taken by a governing body, the LEA would have to accept it. My hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough raised the question in the first instance because the word "may" is inappropriate in that context, whereas it is appropriate in regulation 5(2).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I entirely understand the point that the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough rightly raised about the context of paragraphs (2) and (3), but as I have already explained, my understanding is that it is the responsibility of the governing body to decide between the option of appointing the sole remaining head to the headship of the whole school or of advertising the post. At that point, it is the governors' duty to make that appointment in the way that is stated throughout the order. However, I shall carefully consider how to deal in the most effective way with the point that has been raised because it is a fair one. Our intention is exactly that which was stated by the hon. Member for Bath.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is what I was getting at when I drew attention to the distinction between paragraphs (2) and (3). Paragraph (3) is intended to give local education authorities discretion not to do what the governing body says. Therefore, a different word should be used instead of "may", if the order is to give effect to the Minister's intentions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand what is being said, but the intention of the legislation is not in any way to vary the power of the governing body to make a decision to operate in that way. The legislation provides that the governors should be able to make a choice between appointing the existing head to the headship of the new school or advertising the new appointment. That is the issue addressed in the legislation.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere raised a point about the head of governors. Again, the law is clear on that issue. Only one ex officio head is a member of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
governing body, and in the event that one of the people who has been head continues in the school but is no longer the head of the new school, he or she would not be the ex officio member of the governing body. One head would be ex officio head of the governing body.<br><br>
I shall move on to what happens to the sole remaining head, if he or she does not get the job of head of the whole school. In those circumstances, he or she would be redundant as a head teacher but the governing body would have the discretion to retain that person as a teacher and to safeguard his or her pay, pension and other conditions of service at the same level that applied when the person was head teacher of the department of the school. So, that person would not suffer in terms of pay, pensions and other conditions of service.<br><br>
The whole purpose of the legislation, which was fully discussed in the House, and which received general support, is to reach a situation in which one head is responsible for the school. However, we do not want to introduce the new provisions in a way that is heartless or unfair to individuals who have given service in many ways. That is why the governing body should continue to have the ability to maintain the pay and conditions of service of the person who was, but is no longer, a head teacher.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It might not be heartless or unfair, but it might be unrealistic. Given that the person who is appointed as the one head teacher will be taking on greater responsibility for both sections of the school, the post would presumably command an increase in salary. Therefore, the total cost to the combined school of having one overall head teacher on a higher salary and retaining the original head teacher—who will not continue on his or her previous salary—will mean an increase in the school's salary bill without an increase in its income. Does the Minister accept that that is unrealistic, even if the option is left to the governors?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not unrealistic. However, the hon. Gentleman is right to point out that, in such difficult personnel matters, the governing body has to weigh two important considerations. First, it must consider the total cost of any proposed solution. The hon. Gentleman made a fair and legitimate point about that, although I stress that the relative costs of experienced teachers compared with those of new teachers on the teaching force is a commonplace consideration for governing bodies. The issue that we are discussing is not qualitatively different.<br><br>
The second consideration is more difficult and was raised by the hon. Members for Bath and for Harrogate and Knaresborough. It is the tensions that can arise in a teaching force because of the process that we are considering. Those two considerations will be high among a governing body's priorities when it decides which option to choose. The hon. Member for Bath was right to draw attention to such managerial problems, which a governing body must tackle. However, when considering the School Standards and Framework Bill, the House took the view that, for all the reasons that have been given, it was important to have one head of a school. That will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0637">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
make managerial issues easier to address. Although the issues that have been raised are legitimate, they should not stand in the way of the regulations.<br><br>
A point was made about the position of deputy heads. The same considerations that apply to head teachers can apply to deputy heads. However, the regulations do not deal with deputy heads. The remaining head does not affect the position of the existing deputy head. Relationships in the context that I described must be addressed when governing bodies consider the vast range of issues that surround the process that we are discussing.<br><br>
Consultation was mentioned. The regulations are transitional and we have not consulted formally on them. Before making changes that are not transitional, we shall consult formally. My hon. Friend the Minister for School Standards referred to that in the debate that was mentioned earlier.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foster</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will be disappointed by that response. On 10 February 1998, the Minister for School Standards said:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"The Department has already begun the process of drawing together the regulations on which want to consult."—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 10 February 1998; c. 439.]</p></blockquote>
It is surprising that there has been no attempt at consultation, given that preparations were being made 18 months ago.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if I was not sufficiently clear. My hon. Friend the Minister for School Standards was referring to the long term. The regulations provide for transitional arrangements. They are not designed to worsen anybody's position, but have been drawn up to ensure that when the relevant sections of the School Standards and Framework Act are effected, they do not cause disadvantage in particular circumstances.<br><br>
I hope that the Committee will accept the regulations, which reflect the House's intentions.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Education (Head Teachers) Regulations 1999.</p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Committee rose at four minutes Past Eleven o'clock.</i></p>
