	<div class='legislation'>National Health Service (General Medical Services) Amendment (No. 2) Regulations 1999</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Evan Harris 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Oxford, West and Abingdon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the Committee has considered the National Health Service (General Medical Services) Amendment (No. 2) Regulations 1999 (S.I. 1999, No. 1627).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the National Health Service (General Medical Services) (Scotland) Amendment (No. 3) Regulations 1999 (S.I. 1999, No. 1620).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The statutory instruments will insert into schedule 11 of the National Health Service General Medical Services) Regulations 1992 specific drugs for treating the condition of male erectile dysfunction), in England, Scotland and Wales. They will ensure that such drugs are available only to male erectile dysfunction patients whose illnesses fall into specific categories of pathological conditions. The Liberal Democrats contend that the Committee should not agree to the regulations because they are flawed in principle and in detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall concentrate initially on the principle. Our debate of the regulations will not concern only rationing, or whatever other term hon. Members would like to use. We shall also discuss the way in which treatments are rationed and discrimination in the national health service, which may affect the provision of NHS services. Hon. Members in all parties feel strongly about that issue, and we shall no doubt treat the matter with extra caution in the light of recent incidents involving NHS discrimination. It is incumbent upon us as Members of Parliament not to promulgate primary or secondary legislation that causes discrimination that cannot be justified on clinical grounds. Hon. Members will know that those sentiments have been expressed on both sides of the House in the past, and that unjustifiable discrimination could relate to racial origin, age, gender, sexuality or disability. We must ask ourselves whether any aspect of the regulations discriminates against people with specific disabilities on grounds that are not clinically justifiable for reasons of cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the spirit of constructive opposition, I shall also welcome some aspects of the statutory instrument and of the debate that it provokes. The first point that we welcome is the Government's admission in the statutory instruments and in announcements concerning viagra—the drug that has led the debate on impotence treatments that is central to the regulations—that the NHS cannot afford necessary investment with current funding. That is an important
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
admission, as it was not made clearly to the electorate at election time by every party represented in the Room today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The idea that the NHS is safe and that no big increases in public expenditure or in NHS funding from general taxation will be necessary is a cruel myth to spread among the population. We recognise and welcome the Government's admission that the NHS cannot afford everything that it needs with current funding. It is important that admissions about affordability, about whether the NHS can afford to provide required services and about whether specific treatments can be afforded should come from the Government. The Liberal Democrats do not blame them for the fact that specific drugs, treatments and health needs cannot be met from the current budget, and we welcome their admission in respect of the relatively small aspect of health care covered by the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we regret about the statutory instrument and the broader debate is the Government's refusal formally to admit that, in areas other than the treatment of male erectile dysfunction, there is a discrepancy between need and provision—between the demand for real health services for real health needs and the ability of the NHS to provide those services. It is important that the Government recognise that that mismatch exists, because we will then be able to have a sensible debate about what can and cannot be afforded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What would have happened if people had seen this statutory instrument coming down the line before the last election? Those who hoped to use the NHS if they got into a position of real medical need—I hope that there will be no debate about the fact that male erectile dysfunction is a recognised condition and represents a clinical need—might have wanted the opportunity to vote for a party that did not pretend that rationing and the restriction of treatment were not round the corner. They might have wanted to vote for a party that said that the NHS was so underfunded that it could no longer meet the demands that were made on it in a reasonable time scale or at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second thing that we regret is the panicky way in which the Government reacted to the spectre—as they saw it—of a new, effective treatment coming down the line. They reacted with interim guidance, which the High Court has since declared illegal. That guidance is not the subject of this debate, and I shall not go into it in detail. However, the political panic that the media and, it must be said, some in the medical profession and the British Medical Association stoked up was responsible for the speed and nature of the guidance. As a result, the recognition that the Government should have given to doctors' primary duty—a medical duty of care to their patients, rather than a duty to obey political diktat based on political panic—was overridden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I and my party are prepared to let bygones be bygones as regards the interim guidance. We are dealing with the statutory instrument and not the interim guidance, which called on doctors not to prescribe a drug even though their terms and conditions stated that they should do so where they
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0119">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
felt that it met their patients' medical needs. The press reported threats of employment action by the employers of certain GPs who had prescribed a drug that they felt would be of use. Those GPs might have been exposed to action for breach of their terms and conditions if they had not prescribed the drug.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third thing that we regret—indeed, we deplore it—is the discriminatory way in which rationing has been carried out. That bring us to the core of the issue, and I shall come back to that to discuss it in more detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fourth thing that we deplore is the use of schedule 11 of the National Health Service (General Medical Services) Regulations 1992 to carry out rationing. If the rationing of treatment on the basis of affordability is necessary where there is clear health need and no clinical justification for restricting treatment, a mechanism should have been set up in the Health Bill, whether or not that involved secondary legislation. The Health Bill provided the Government with an excellent opportunity honestly to accept the fact that current NHS resources, sadly, could not meet current health need and that rationing on the basis of affordability was round the corner. At the same time that the Health Bill was going through Parliament, the Government recognised that the NHS could not afford treatment for male erectile dysfunction, even in cases of clinical need. None the less, they turned down the many opportunities offered by Liberal Democrat amendments to use primary legislation, which could have been debated and voted on, to set up the necessary mechanisms. It is a misuse of schedule 11 to ration on the basis of affordability, because, for certain conditions, there is no clinical justification for using schedule 11 drugs at all or in preference to other drugs. I do not believe that the Minister will be able to justify rationing, but he will have to justify using regulations that were never meant for the purpose of rationing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some specific concerns about the regulations have been raised. Members of the Committee have been given a briefing from Pfizer, the pharmaceutical company that manufactures Viagra, which is one of the relevant drugs in this context. I should declare an interest at this point. I received funding from a pharmaceutical company to go to the United States on an NHS study tour in oncology, and, through another pharmaceutical company, I am a member of the Industry and Parliament Trust training scheme for Members of Parliament. As far as I know, neither of those companies make any of the medicines that we are discussing in relation to the statutory instruments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I strongly agree with the argument that is set out in Pfizer's document, which states:
	<br><q><p>"the Statutory Instrument is outwith the spirit of the parent legislation set out by the 1977 National Health Act … Parliament was advised in 1985 that a Schedule 11 listing was a legitimate restriction on budgetary grounds where a medicinal product had more than one distinct therapeutic use and met the criterion of having clinical advantages over other cheaper medicinal products for at least one of those uses, but did not meet the criterion for all of them. The conditions set out in Schedule 11, therefore made clear the indications for which the prescription was justified under the NHS as being the most economic option to meet the recognised clinical need for all or particular categories of patients. On similar grounds, Schedule 11 has been used to cover circumstances where a product
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
such as a food supplement might have a medicinal purpose for some patients, but could not be treated as having a medicinal indication for all. In isolated cases it has been used where products were already available without prescription (nicotine replacement) or where misuse has arisen (Temazopam capsules) and clinical alternatives were available."</p></q>
Clearly, none of those circumstances apply in this case. The Government will have to admit that the reason why these drugs have been placed under schedule 11 is so as to control the cost of the treatment of male erectile dysfunction. The statutory instrument states that a man who is suffering from the following conditions can continue to receive treatment on the NHS:
	<br><q><p>"diabetes</p></q>
	<br><q><p>multiple sclerosis</p></q>
	<br><q><p>Parkinson's disease</p></q>
	<br><q><p>poliomyelitis</p></q>
	<br><q><p>prostate cancer</p></q>
	<br><q><p>severe pelvic injury"</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Norman A. Godman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenock and Inverclyde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. O'Brien. I apologise profusely to the hon. Gentleman for interrupting his lengthy discourse, but may I seek your guidance? Are we in order in debating statutory instrument 1999 No. 1620, which is entitled National Health Service (General Medical Services) (Scotland)? I ask that because if, for example, electroconvulsive therapy for the treatment of manic depression were to be banned in England by this House, we would not have the right to institute a similar ban on the use of that treatment in Scottish hospitals. It seems to me that the issues that are covered by the statutory instrument are a matter for the Scottish Parliament, not this one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Calum Macdonald)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. O'Brien. It may be helpful to my hon. Friend if I point out that the regulations were extensively discussed with Scottish Executive Ministers and were signed on 8 June, before the full devolution settlement took place—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is not a point of order for the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The list of conditions continues:
	<br><q><p>"single gene neurological disease
	<div class='ul'>
	<li>spina bifida</li>
	<li>spinal cord injury; or</li>

	<li>prostatectomy</li>
	<li>radical pelvic surgery</li>
	<li>renal failure treated by transplant."</li></div> <!-- ul --></p></q>
I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight (Dr. Brand) will want to catch your eye, Mr. O'Brien, to give the Committee the benefit of his clinical experience of those conditions and to point to some problems that may arise in considering them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The list is limited and excludes, for example, those whose cardiovascular disease is an underlying cause of their erectile dysfunction, and those with psychogenic disease. Both groups of patients will clearly benefit from the treatments for male erectile dysfunction
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0120">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
outlined in schedule 11. Therefore, patients whose erectile dysfunction is caused by cardiovascular, psychological or other conditions, which are not included in the list, are being arbitrarily deprived of NHS treatment that would be of use to them for a recognised clinical condition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The list is not arbitrary in only one way. The Government have calculated that including those conditions in the list will lead to a certain amount of expenditure on treatments for male erectile dysfunction on the NHS, but that excluding large numbers of patients with other conditions will ensure that there is no greater NHS expenditure than the broad amount that the Government believe is already being spent on those conditions and which they do not want increased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are clearly in a difficult position, as the resources currently provided for the NHS cannot meet the need. but is it fair, on an arbitrary basis, to say to men with certain conditions, "For you, the NHS will not provide"? Let us take the example of two men who have paid taxes all their life and expect to receive treatment for the same recognised clinical condition that is causing them distress. One can receive treatment on the NHS and one cannot, the distinguishing factor being the pathological basis of their condition, not the benefit that each would receive from the treatment. That is one of the fundamental flaws in the Government's approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Diabetes affects small blood vessels. It has been postulated that some of these treatments, particularly the vasoactive ones such as Viagra—Sildenafil—would be less effective in men with diabetes who qualify for treatment than for men with cardiovascular disease who require action at small vessel level to increase blood flow. Arguably, people who will benefit less are being allowed NHS treatment for which they have paid their taxes, while men whose medical condition causes them the same distress and incapacity cannot have that treatment even though they will benefit more. For a doctor who has to prescribe medication, that is a perverse approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I doubt the appropriateness of the regulations, and I doubt their propriety, because they are based on discrimination. Furthermore, I believe that doctors will be asked to act unethically. They will be forced to deny patients, particularly those who are not well off, NHS treatment—and therefore all treatment—although those patients could benefit more than those for whom doctors are allowed to provide treatment. The Government must recognise the perversity of the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The way in which this rationing has been decided is clearly discriminatory. The Government would be appalled if medical practitioners were depriving patients of treatment simply because of their race. They would recognise that it would be wrong if two men with similar conditions would benefit from treatment, but while one would receive it because he had white skin, the other would be denied it because he had black skin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
I question the Government at a nitty-gritty level. What is the difference between people whose genes cause them to have a cardiovascular reason for their impotence, and those whose genes cause them to have a metabolic or real reason for their condition? Providing treatment for one but not the other is discriminatory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Philip Hammond 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Runnymede and Weybridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that a more precise analogy might be discrimination in the availability of treatment for human immunodeficiency virus based on the way in which the disease was acquired? We are discussing treatment for a single medical condition, and making the availability of treatment dependent on its cause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I was going to use that example because it brings the issue home clearly. Schedule 11 listing means that people will be excluded from treatment on the basis of the cause of their condition rather than on the basis of the likelihood that they will benefit. While I was a clinician working with HIV and while I have been a politician, I have condemned people who discriminate in their treatment of people with that virus on the basis of the cause of the patients' infection whether through sexual activity or through a blood transfusion. The Government are almost certainly on record as deploring such discrimination. The hon. Gentleman's analogy fits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one accepts, as we do, that the Government are in a difficult position not of their own making over how the NHS might afford the treatments that it wishes to provide, one might reasonably ask on what basis they should ration the use of drugs. The Minister could fairly throw that question back at us. We recognise the position that the Government have found themselves in, but—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman again, but I am surprised to hear him say that the Government find themselves in a position not of their own making. Will he clarify what he means by that? I would have thought that, two years since they were elected and with a comprehensive spending review out of the way, the position was very much of the Government's own making.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem of the mismatch between NHS resources and NHS need is one of long standing. I have always defined the NHS as chronically underfunded. I hope that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) will recognise that the NHS did not suddenly become chronically underfunded, either on 1 May 1997 or two years after the Government's election, when they finally threw themselves free of the shackles of Conservative spending plans. There is chronic underfunding, and the Government should accept that even the funding under the comprehensive spending review will not significantly address that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have inherited the chronic underfunding of the NHS—and, to date, have done nothing to change it. [	<i>Laughter.</i>] The Minister seems amused. The extra resources from the comprehensive review are significant, and will give additional funding

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
of about 5 per cent. over the next three years. The Library of the House has calculated that over the course of the Parliament, there will be additional funding in real terms of 3.7 per cent. or 3.8 per cent. The Conservatives managed 3.1 per cent over their last term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the increase in additional funding of 0.6 per cent. a year during the Parliament does not represent the saving of the NHS and the avoidance of such rationing decisions as we are debating—the Minister cannot find that amusing. It is ludicrous to suggest that a difference of 0.6 per cent. could achieve that, especially when the money from that additional funding is taken up by spending on the millennium bug and other factors that I accept are also not the Government's fault.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am trying to help the Government. We recognise that they are in difficulty because the NHS cannot meet all the demands on it, given the available funding. The Government must ensure that NHS budgets are protected for the most appropriate use. They may legitimately say that they do not wish funding of treatment of male erectile dysfunction to exceed the current sum. They may say that the funding priority given to that problem should not rise, even though a new cost-effective and clinically-effective treatment is available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the fact that the Government have made an announcement on the subject and that they have not tried to hide behind doctors or advisory boards. However, they should have said how much they wished to see spent in the NHS and what the budget was to be at each health authority level. Also, they should have taken responsibility for the fact that there would have to be limits and that they would ask doctors to prescribe medication within the budget for those who would benefit most. We could debate whether such budgeting should be done through general practice or secondary care—when I first raised the issue in an Adjournment debate in July 1998, I thought that the Government were going to do that. The Minister's predecessor certainly suggested that he was thinking on those lines. The Government could have done that, and we would have supported them because that would have at least, been better than this method. To take an arbitrary measure and to use schedule 11 where it is inappropriate is the wrong way to proceed; there was another way to proceed while recognising the Government's responsibility to protect NHS budgets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a few other points to make, but I know that other Committee members will want to speak. Pfizer says in its briefing that it believes both sets of regulations to be inaccurate. Schedule 11 is intended to be applied to a therapeutic class of products. Not all licensed pharmaceutical products for erectile dysfunction are included in the draft. Viridal is specifically mentioned, but Viridal Duo is a distinct product with a separate product licence and different dosages and NHS price, and will not be included in schedule 11. My hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight will draw attention to other questions about the list of conditions that the Government have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
unfortunately chosen to use as the basis for rationing treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognise that rationing must happen. That is not to call for rationing but to recognise that the earth is round. If rationing must happen, it is right for the Government to take a stand themselves. The Government control the freedom—the funding—of the NHS to solve such problems. It is difficult to alter the amount of medical need in the NHS, except by long-term public health policies. Funding controls the freedom of the NHS. The Government control funding, so they should not seek to hide behind medical committees or individual doctors in implementing rationing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where rationing exists, it is appropriate that it is done according to clinical need, rather than on an arbitrary basis. Even if it is done on an arbitrary basis, it should not be done in a discriminatory way. It is only through the Government's good fortune that some of the excluded conditions cannot be clearly matched with specific ethnic groups, which would make it hard for the Government to defend their practice against existing race discrimination legislation. Indeed, if age discrimination legislation—which we have called for in general, and have proposed amendments to introduce in the NHS—were in place, such measures might well be found to be illegal, because the excluded conditions will tend to discriminate in a non-clinically justified manner on the basis of age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is still time for the Government to reconsider the matter, withdraw the regulations and work with the medical profession and Opposition parties to find a non-arbitrary, non-irrational and non-discriminatory manner of rationing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.57 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We often attend delegated legislation Standing Committees to discuss rather obscure matters, of which Committee members scuttle through their papers in the few moments before the Committee meets to reach some understanding. This issue is different; it has received substantial publicity during the past six to nine months and has generated much interest in the press, as well as in Parliament. It is rather sad to see the Minister looking uncharacteristically glum on the last day before the recess. However, having listened to the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris), I can understand that. The Minister finds himself in an impossible position, defending the indefensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not detain the Committee for long, because, as I would have expected, the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon has eloquently and comprehensively addressed the issues that Committee must consider. Two statutory instruments are before us—one dealing with England and Wales and the other with Scotland. The issues before us are for the most part generic and relate to both statutory instruments. My hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) will seek to catch your eye, Mr. O'Brien, in order to address a couple of issues
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0122">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
relating specifically to the Scottish statutory instrument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In laying these regulations and, indeed, in their whole handling of the Viagra debacle, the Government have crossed the rubicon. For the first time, a clinically effective treatment is being denied to some patients on the NHS for no reason other than that the budget will not stand it. That practice has gone on in the NHS for many years, but it has been conducted on an ad hoc basis at local level. So far as I am aware, this is the first time that such a rationing decision has been explicitly and centrally made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For some time now, Conservative Members have been calling for an open debate on rationing and resource allocation in the national health service. While there is much for us to criticise in the way in which this matter has been handled, we welcome the element of transparency that comes from laying down explicitly the criteria for treatment so that everyone can understand. They will therefore know whether they would be eligible for treatment if they suffered from a given condition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon said that what he described as the chronic underfunding of the national health service was not of the Government's making, at which point my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield said from a sedentary position that the problem began in 1948. There is probably something in that. The chronic underfunding of the NHS is not of the Government's making; it is a continuing problem relating to the underlying structure of the health service and the way in which it operates. The Government have set the NHS budget for the next three years in their comprehensive spending review.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Health (Mr. John Denham)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that 1948 was the year when the Conservative party voted against the establishment of the national health service. Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that what he described as the chronic underfunding of the NHS at that time actually led to a massive improvement in health provision for the great majority of the population, rather than for the few who depended on private medicines?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Minister has repeated the slur on my party's position which he made in his final comments in last week's Opposition-led debate in the House on health care. I shall come back to that in a minute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The NHS in 1948 addressed a problem at that time, and I have no doubt that it had a significant impact on the nation's health in the years immediately after 1948. I also recall, however, that it was widely believed at the time by those who were behind the NHS that its cost burden would decline over the years as a result of innovation in the service. As we all know, that did not happen. In fact, the opposite occurred and the costs of the health service have continued to rise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although in 1948 the NHS was unique in Europe—something that the British people came to be very proud of throughout the 1950s—competitive models
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
were then developed in other European countries. I do not intend to talk about the system in the United States, because it is a very bad example of how to deliver health care, but among our friends and competitors throughout Europe, there are various other models of delivering health services that are free at the point of need and various funding mechanisms that have proved to be effective in delivering health care to our neighbours.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is the case, would the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will come in a moment to the specific issue of the availability of Viagra. There are two points—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The Minister has asked what he obviously thinks is a very clever question, but he is not interested in listening to the answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is that we cannot have a mature debate about the national health service. Any form of innovative thinking about the problems that are facing the national health service is attacked by the Minister and his colleagues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister and his colleagues insist that there is no rationing in the national health service, while defending a statutory instrument that makes that rationing, in relation to a specific drug, explicit and transparent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members are in a very strange position, because we have been saying for a considerable time that there is rationing in the national health service. We recognise that there will always have to be an element of rationing in a health service that delivers health care free at the point of need, and that we need to rationalise the way in which that rationing is applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In laying this statutory instrument, the Secretary of State has moved down the path to a rationalised, codified system of rationing. The problem, which the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) has outlined, is that in this case the Government have chosen some irrational criteria on which to ration the drug in question. It is because the Government are in denial—increasingly absurd denial—that there is any rationing in the national health service that we have to question some of the underlying issues that have been raised by the laying of this statutory instrument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not true. My right hon. Friend the Member for Horsham (Mr. Maude) has confirmed that we welcome the increase in spending in the national health service. The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon has pointed out that, over the lifetime of this Parliament, the real increase in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0123">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
spending is about 0.6 per cent. per annum over and above the trend increase that took place under the previous Conservative Government. I have said, and my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe) said when she was shadow Secretary of State, that that is a welcome increase. It will be a useful injection of cash into the national health service, but it is insufficient even to begin to address the fundamental problem. That is entirely pertinent to today's debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister knows that although that extra cash will help in some respects—such as in meeting the dramatically increased cost of blood products to the national health service—it does not remove the need to tackle problems of the type that the Secretary of State has rightly recognised arise from the introduction of products such as Viagra. Many more such products will be coming in the years ahead. Therefore, the debate is not only about Viagra and about what, with the benefit of hindsight, looks like the rather modest financial implications that it would have had for the national health service, but about what will happen when similar innovative products become available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are told that the National Institute for Clinical Excellence will assess the clinical cost benefit of the availability of new drugs—or some new drugs. In recent weeks and months, I have discussed that with very many people in the industry and the academic world, and no one seems to know exactly what the term clinical cost benefit means. We know what clinical benefit means and what cost benefit is, but we are not sure what clinical cost benefit means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that NICE should evaluate the benefits that flow from given interventions, look at the resulting costs, and present its findings in an objective and transparent way. Politicians could then take rational decisions about the use of the national health service's finite resources and bring maximum benefit to the British people. Will NICE be asked to establish a proper, transparent framework for decision taking and priority setting? That would enable the public and politicians to understand why drugs are made available through the national health service or, as in the case before us today, in limited circumstances only. It would also make clear the ranking of costs and benefits of new products in the pecking order of existing products, which have to compete for the health service's finite resources. None of the current proposals will provide the evaluation process or the decision-making process with such transparency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever else such an evaluation might achieve, rationally, it could not determine availability according to the underlying cause of a given condition. The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon dwelt on the iniquity of treating differently patients with a particular clinical condition, according to how they came to acquire it. Even more absurd, under the regulations, they will be treated differently according to when they came to acquire it. Patients who had the misfortune to suffer from a condition before 14 September 1998 will continue to receive treatment, but a significant percentage—perhaps 70 per cent.—of those who acquired it after that date will
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
not receive treatment through the national health service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the Secretary of State's concern to protect the health service's overall resources, but there is no rational basis for that cut-off point; nor should a distinction be drawn between groups of causes that will be treated and groups that will not. The provision is exposed for what it is—an exercise in rationing, based on the cost of treatment and the limitation of resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The King's Fund, which is generally regarded as an objective commentator on health care, has said that
	<br><q><p>"restricting demand by diagnostic criteria does not have any inherent rationale".</p></q>
What will come next? As new and potentially expensive drugs become available, will such exercises become the norm? Can the Minister explain the way in which the Government intend to use schedule 11 to the principal regulations? As the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon said, it was certainly not meant to be used for purposes such as these. It is a tool that can legitimately be used where therapeutic outcomes may differ, or where the relative merits of given treatments may differ for different classes of a condition, but it was never meant to be used in the way in which the Government are now using it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have abandoned the NHS principle that doctors should be free to treat their patients according to clinical need. The Secretary of State has taken that decision and he must acknowledge it. In most people's everyday parlance, limiting the availability of a drug for reasons not of clinical need but of cost and the finite nature of available resources, may not be a bad or evil thing, but it is certainly an exercise in rationing. If the Government would acknowledge that that is precisely what they are doing, at least some good would come out of this sorry episode.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members object to the Government's continued denial of the essence of what they are doing and their attempt to make rationing decisions on the basis of cost and then justify them on spurious clinical grounds. Rationing in the NHS is clearly necessary—we openly acknowledge that—but it must be done transparently and rationally. If the Government are to ration treatments and drugs, it is surely better for people to understand what will, and will not, be available. I have made that point to the Minister on many occasions. If we are to have rationing, it should be undertaken by a mechanism such as NICE—which makes that rationing explicit and transparent—rather than by postcode rationing at local level on an ad hoc basis That is because people who understand what their national health service can and cannot provide for them can then, if they wish, take the opportunity to consider making further arrangements to protect themselves where the Government have made it clear that the NHS will not be able to do so. It is objectionable for the Government, while introducing a system of explicit rationing, to continue to heap abuse on anyone who suggests that it is legitimate in a modern and democratic consumer society for people to make other arrangements to protect themselves
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0124">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
above and beyond the level of care that the NHS can offer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most oppressive form of the exercise of the power of the state is when it is arbitrary and irrational, and the criteria that are contained in the statutory instrument are arbitrary and irrational. The medical profession and common sense both tell us that. The history surrounding the Secretary of State's handling of the Viagra issue is not a happy one. His initial reaction—to advise doctors not to prescribe it at all—was a publicity stunt that was clearly, with the benefit of hindsight, arbitrary and irrational, and it was rightly shot down by the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon referred to sloppy drafting. I am sure that the Government have had their attention drawn to the fact that Viridal Duo, one of the drugs that should have been covered by the statutory instrument, is not mentioned, while Viridal, which is a separately licensed product, is covered. Can the Minister explain that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point relates to the requirement that patients who fall outside the specific criteria should, in cases of severe distress, be seen by a consultant urologist. We have grave practical concerns about the state of the available urological resources in this country and the effect that the requirement will have. Has the Minister assessed the likely impact on urological services in hospitals, and what can he tell us about the consequences for other patients who are awaiting urological procedures?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State's decision has heightened public awareness of rationing. Perhaps the Secretary of State chose to act, in the case of Viagra, for that reason—bizarrely. He must have known that the popular press would latch on to the issue and make much of it. It is a strange example, because Viagra may not have saved the national health service very much money. The statutory instrument withdraws existing and proven effective treatments as well as making non-available, in many cases, the new treatment, Viagra.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a complete muddle. Although we acknowledge the need to define what the NHS can and cannot do in providing health care that is free at the point of need, this is not the way to define the boundaries. An arbitrary division, based on the diagnostic history of the patient, is clearly discriminatory and inappropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If any good comes out of this, it will be to put the rationing debate centre stage. But for that debate to take off and be effective, we need a Government who are honest enough to acknowledge that rationing exists. They should also be open enough to sponsor, as well as participate in, a public debate on the appropriate boundaries of a publicly financed health service that is free at the point of need. They should deal with the matter comprehensively, considering all the issues involved, not picking off individual drugs on a piecemeal basis. Today it is Viagra, tomorrow it may be Relenza. In the future, who knows what we will, in a Standing Committee on delegated legislation, be consigning to schedule 11 of the drug tariff?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I do a clinical surgery on Monday mornings, and I would very much like the Minister's response on the drafting of paragraph 2(2)(d). It refers to
	<br><q><p>"a man who is suffering from any of the following—"</p></q>
and then lists a number of conditions. However, it does not refer to men whose erectile dysfunction is due to those conditions. People having to apply the regulations will face a practical problem. I do not know the Minister's definition of diabetes. Is it someone whose diabetes is controlled by diet, who may have had an occasional trace of sugar in the urine, but whose impotence is caused not by diabetes but by cardiovascular disease or psychological reasons?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The list also includes poliomyelitis. Luckily, a lot of people who had polio when they were younger have made an almost complete recovery. Impotence is not necessarily a problem for such people, but presumably they would qualify for Viagra if they were impotent for any other reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been estimated, that on autopsy prostatic cancer cells are found in the prostates of 80 per cent. of men over 80. So can one assume that people over a certain age are likely to have prostatic cancer, and therefore qualify for this drug?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who defines severe pelvic injury? As for single gene neurological disease—colour blindness is a wonderful example. As far as I know, it does not directly cause erectile dysfunction, but under the regulations, if I did a colour blindness test on a patient who complained of erectile dysfunction—who might be a bit confused at that—and he was colour blind, he would qualify for Viagra.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Spina bifida is a condition that has a wide range of presentations. There is spina bifida occulta, which is an X-ray diagnosis and causes no problems, but it is still spina bifida. Presumably people who have it would qualify for this treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Spinal cord injury has not been defined. Are we really saying that people with chronic bad backs—whom I would like to get back to work rather than hump around too much—should qualify for Viagra while other people do not? I am told that sexual intercourse is good for bad backs, so perhaps the drug may have a curative effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is serious. The regulations as currently drafted would make it extraordinarily difficult for a practising clinician to apply the rules and to stick to them. They may apply to a man receiving treatment for renal failure by dialysis, and one could say the same in that respect, but what happens to a man who is still waiting to receive treatment by dialysis? Presumably such a patient will be excluded, and will, therefore, suffer a double jeopardy of rationing. Of course, surgery can have awful consequences, but it does not have to. These are real and practical problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

They tend to be referred to the local prostatic surgeon, who delights in doing mysterious things involving lots of blood and sharp instruments.

That again illustrates the problem, which exists no matter what we think about the broader aspects of the regulations, about which all the arguments have been well rehearsed.

Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge has dealt with it. I shall not take up the Committee's time by repeating or endorsing his comments. However, the regulations place us in an unusual state of affairs. The Committee is considering two statutory instruments. One concerns Scotland and the other England and Wales. Historically, discussion of statutory instruments concerning England, Wales and Scotland would have been a normal state of affairs, but we are considering the regulations before us post-devolution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Early in the sitting, the hon. Member for Greenock and Inverclyde rather let the cat out of the bag when he raised a point of order. He asked whether it was in order for us to consider the instrument concerning Scotland. The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland gave an answer that I am sure was correct, and said that it was in order to consider the instrument as it was laid on 8 June, before the devolved powers of the Scottish Parliament came into being.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Presumably, that procedure applies just as it did last Friday when the House debated a private Member's Bill relating to Scotland—the Mental Health (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill. The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland attended that debate. There are, however, some differences in nature and extent between the provisions debated last Friday and those before us today. Last Friday's debate was on a private Member's Bill with cross-party endorsement in this Parliament and in the Scottish Parliament. It also enjoyed support from all interested parties, including
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
the Law Society of Scotland. Unfortunately, I was unable to attend the debate, but there was no hesitation in my mind that the Bill should have gone through notwithstanding the fact that devolution had occurred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now, at the end of July, a month into the running of the Scottish Parliament, we are considering a statutory instrument that is undoubtedly contentious. One could tell that it was contentious simply by listening to the speech of the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not received even the smallest representation expressing approval in Scotland for our acting on behalf of the Scottish Parliament. The Under-Secretary will undoubtedly correct me at once if I am wrong, but I understand that the matter falls wholly within the devolved remit of the Scottish Parliament. That Parliament is concerned with health expenditure and it will receive the block grant to which it is entitled. How the money from that block grant is spent is entirely a matter for that Parliament. As should be well known in the House, the way in which that money has been allocated historically means that Scotland receives approximately 20 per cent. per head more in health funding than England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stress that I state that not as a matter of complaint, I note how extraordinary it is that we should be debating the issue and applying blanket criteria, given that the level of chronic underfunding, as the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon commented, is likely to come under different considerations north and south of the border. I find it extraordinary that we can start to apply blanket criteria to the rationing on the NHS of Viagra and other drugs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary's words came out a little sotto voce, but I got the impression that he said in his brief intervention further to the point of order that people in Scotland were happy for us to go ahead and pass the order. I have to ask who is happy for us to do that. Is the Under Secretary talking about his colleagues on the Scottish Executive—some of whom also sit as our colleagues in this place? Is he talking about the Scottish Parliament? Has it had an opportunity to debate the issue and has it demonstrated that it is happy for us to act as its agents in the matter for the sake of time? Who, north of the border, has said that, notwithstanding devolution, we should make decisions that will deprive certain patients in Scotland of the opportunity to obtain those treatments?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a great believer in making devolution work now that it is up and running. As part of that process, we should obey both the letter and the spirit of devolution. Such decisions must be taken north of the border unless there is unanimity there for our acting on their behalf. It is clear from the way in which the devolved system has been established that the Scottish Parliament may pass statutory instruments that will allow a treatment to be available north of the border that is not available south of it. I would like an explanation of why it is thought right for us to be so acting.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman moves on to his further points, I would like to question the synthetic indignation that he has exhibited, which possibly masks a basic question. There is surely a case for transitional arrangements while a Parliament is being established. The order was made on 8 June 1999 and laid before this Parliament on 10 June; executive powers were assumed by the Scottish Parliament only on 1 July. The basis on which the decision is to be taken in this place seems reasonable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the hon. Gentleman that my indignation is not synthetic. By virtue of my having been appointed the Opposition spokesman for Scotland, I have spent much of the past month trying to get myself into the job—to understand what it involves and how the constitution will work regarding the relations of the United Kingdom with Scotland and of Westminster with Edinburgh. I want to see those relations work. The hon. Gentleman says that it is possible to have transitional arrangements, and I accept that. Indeed, there was great convenience in our considering the Mental Health (Amendment) (Scotland) Bill last Friday. Had there been an Opposition in Scotland, I would have come to the House on Friday and said that we were not in favour of the Bill. However, there was not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this case, however, I take a different view and I must question the convenience of the transitional provisions. The risk is that the rules in Scotland will differ from those in the rest of the United Kingdom for a few months. We will have to start getting used to that over the coming months and years, because many differences will emerge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask the hon. Gentleman a question in the same spirit in which the hon. Gentleman asked the Minister about the discussions that had taken place in Scotland. What position is the hon. Gentleman in, as the Member of Parliament for Beaconsfield, to judge whether there is great public concern in Scotland? Has he had discussions with colleagues in the Scottish Parliament or with Scots themselves? What representations has he received on the issue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Grieve</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That question is not relevant. As a Member of this House, I have responsibility for and should interest myself in the residual matters and reserved issues that are going to the Scottish Office—that is my remit. I also try to keep abreast of much that goes on in Scotland, which I visit frequently. However, I am reluctant to get involved in devolved matters, because that is not my job. If devolution is to be made to work, I should refrain from commenting on such matters, unless they pertain to the United Kingdom overall. I am not satisfied that the issue before us is uncontentious north of the border. The proper forum for debate is, therefore, the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh, not this House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to deal now with the inadequacy of the procedure that we have adopted. I refer the Committee to the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments, of which I happen to be a member and in which I was first alerted to the fact that the extraordinary
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
instrument that we are debating was to come before this Committee. At that stage, I did not know that I would be a member of this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, the Joint Committee's reports are never read—certainly not by the Government, who rarely act on them. None the less, it is worth considering what the Joint Committee had to say about the instrument before us. Leaving aside the fact that we are legislating for Scotland after devolution, the Committee noted that the instrument was appallingly drafted and full of errors. There are errors in the footnotes and in references to previous statutory instruments, which are irrelevant to the matter that stands to be considered. The whole thing is—if I may use this expression—a dog's dinner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Joint Committee was sufficiently concerned to file a report and to ask the Department for an explanation. Interestingly, the memorandum that we received—this is a pointer to the extraordinary situation into which we are getting—was from the Scottish Executive Health Department, a body over which Members of the House have no control whatever. We obtained the information from it, although I suspect that it did not draft it. Effectively, however, the Department agreed that the measures were defectively drafted, and it accepted all the Joint Committee's criticisms of them. At the end of the memorandum—this was on 13 July 1999, the Department said:
	<br><q><p>"The Department apologises for this error. The error will be corrected in forthcoming Regulations which are to be laid before the Scottish Parliament in August this year. Guidance issued to practitioners in relation to the Regulations makes the intention of the provision clear.</p></q>
That may be so, but the principle omission was not explaining what the patient was supposed to request when the doctor filled in his prescription form. That is a fundamental omission. It also said that they would make careful comparison of drafts to avoid the possibility of similar errors in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Scottish Parliament is shortly to issue new regulations, why are we doing this for them? I am not making a synthetic point, but we are usurping the function of the Scottish Parliament and I want to know who has told the Minister that it is all right to do that. If, as I fear, the answer is the Scottish Executive, my retort will be that the Scottish Executive is not the Scottish Parliament. The matter is one of concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.40 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall endeavour to reply to as many of the issues raised as possible and also to allow time for my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland to comment on the issues raised by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Health Service (General Medical Services) Amendment (No. 2) Regulations 1999 came into effect on 1 July, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State promised on 7 May. The regulations introduce changes to schedule 11 of the principal regulations, the practical effect of which will be to restrict the prescribing by general practitioners of treatment for impotence from 1 July. General practitioners may now prescribe the relevant
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0127">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
treatments under the national health service only for categories of men with specified underlying organic causes of impotence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Brand</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that there is not much time left, but I want to press the Minister on the issue of "impotence caused by" or "a man who is suffering from any of the following". The Minister referred to guidance, but the order does not say what the guidance might say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Guidance has been issued in national health service circular 1999/148, which sets out the content of the regulations and a number of questions likely to be asked by general practitioners. In addition, further guidance will be issued from the Department, particularly on the assessment and subsequent management within secondary care of men who are diagnosed to be suffering from severe distress. That guidance has either been issued or is in the pipeline. In general, we shall have to rely on the clinical skill and judgment of general practitioners, as we do every day in the national health service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The guidance that we have issued also contains a recommendation based on research evidence that treatment be prescribed once a week. Further guidance will be forthcoming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The overall context of the new arrangements is that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State took the view with the introduction of Viagra that the cost of treating impotence should not be allowed to rise substantially and to divert resources from other health conditions and treatments. My right hon. Friend undertook public consultation to help us to find a sensible balance between treating men with the distressing condition of impotence and protecting the resources of the national health service to deal with other patients. The current costs of treating impotence are around £10 million to £12 million a year. We estimate that if no action were taken, that could rise to £37.5 million a year and possibly as high as £81 million a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the recent legal action instituted by Pfizer Ltd., the judge acknowledged that the company had rightly conceded that the Secretary of State was entitled to include medicines in schedule 11 because of resource implications following the likely cost of allowing them to be freely prescribed. Indeed, in his judgment, Mr. Justice Collins said:
	<br><q><p>"It is clear that, for very understandable and proper reasons, the Secretary of State was concerned that Viagra would prove to have a significantly adverse effect on the resources of the NHS".</p></q>
The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon argued that schedule 11 should not be used for that purpose and that a specific alternative provision should be made available. As he said, we debated a variety of amendments to the Health Bill, and we believe that schedule 11 is the proper mechanism for limiting the availability of such treatments. We notified the European Commission of the criteria that formed the basis of our consultation proposal and it confirmed that the financial viability of the national health care system was a specific objective and a verifiable reason for limiting the availability of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
products on NHS prescription. As such, it complies with the terms of the European transparency directive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister concede that that is what most people would call rationing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that we might get on to that, as we have done many times. The hon. Gentleman again says that there is generalised rationing in the NHS. The Government do not accept that. There is not a fixed sum for each member of our society which, once spent, exhausts the ration of health care. Priority setting is necessary in every health care system in the world. We must ensure that we set the right priorities for the NHS to make the best use of available resources. Viagra will be available free to a much larger number of people on the NHS than in all but two other European countries. In the vast majority of European countries, it is not available under any conditions for free health care prescription; people have to pay for it. That suggests that there are merits in our approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We estimate that it would cost £37.5 million to £81 million a year to treat the 20 million men who suffer from complete impotence. Although the data and assumptions are subject to considerable uncertainty, they represent the information that is available. Pfizer's estimate of the potential cost impact of its product is about £50 million after five years. Even the lower estimates represent a considerable increase over current annual expenditure of £10 million to £12 million on all drug treatments for impotence that are prescribed by general practitioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If he had been unable to use schedule 11, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State would have faced a stark choice. Either he would have risked an uncontrolled rise in expenditure, which might have forced him to divert resources from other conditions, or he would have had to prevent GPs from prescribing treatment for impotence altogether. We have introduced a regime that allows more men to be treated for their impotence, without a significant increase in cost, and which is more generous than in most of Europe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that that stark choice is faced every day by GPs and health authorities working within budgetary constraints? Such choices are not new. It is welcome that the Government are taking responsibility for those stark choices. However, our concern is the basis on which decisions to restrict treatment are being made, not the fact that this new drug creates stark choices. New drugs do that all the time, in all kinds of conditions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the reasons for establishing the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, which is becoming a more welcome body than it was at the time of the Health Bill, was to ensure that high-quality, authoritative guidance on the cost-effectiveness of new and existing clinical treatments and procedures was available to those working in the national health service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to be drawn into a debate about NICE, which I am sure we shall have another time. However, in answer to the questions raised by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, we shall
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0128">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
publish further details in the not-too-distant future of the appraisal approach that NICE will take. I hope that that will address the points that he raised, and help to clarify how the national institute is to go about its work. On this occasion, Ministers have felt it necessary to make a specific judgment because of the circumstances that I have outlined. That is reflected in the regulations. NICE in general will also produce guidance relating to the use of the service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Returning to the debate on the regulations, it is reassuring that many respondents to the public consultation supported the view that action needed to be taken. Concern was expressed about distinguishing between patients on the grounds of their underlying condition. The BMA continues to express those concerns. However, no one whom we consulted, including the Standing Medical Advisory Committee or the BMA, proposed an alternative solution that would meet the concerns that I have described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No solution was proposed that was consistent with the objective of containing expenditure at approximately the present level, so as not to divert resources from other health conditions and treatments, or with the general view that drug treatments should be made as widely available as possible for prescription by GPs on the national health service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We decided, therefore, to proceed with the proposals in an amended form, having taken into account the comments as far as possible within available resources. We extended the list of eligible patients to encompass all men treated for prostate cancer, not just those who have had a prostatectomy, as originally proposed. The list also includes men treated for renal failure—transplant or dialysis—and men with polio.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other concerns were raised in consultation, especially about men who were receiving drug treatment before Viagra was licensed having their treatment withdrawn. We took the decision that men who were receiving a drug treatment for impotence on 14 September 1998 should be able to continue to receive treatment from their GP, even if they did not suffer from one of the named conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reviewing the consultation, I must point out to the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon, who advocated that it should be left to GPs to apportion resources within an overall budget, that the majority of GPs who responded to the consultation were in favour of restricting Viagra by means of schedule 11, as we have done. The Government have faced tough choices in drawing up the proposals for eligible conditions, because the experts could not identify a suitable mechanism to measure the extent of clinical need. However, under the arrangements now in place, doctors will know when to write NHS prescriptions and when to prescribe privately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One treatment a week is considered reasonable by most people, but I emphasise that that is advice. The guidance that is issued to doctors makes it clear that if a GP considers that, in his or her clinical judgment,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
more than one treatment is appropriate, that amount should be prescribed under the NHS.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would it be fair to describe one tablet a week as a ration?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The advice about the recommendation in the guidance is based on research about the average frequency of sexual intercourse in the 40–60 age range. The decision is based on that evidence—it is not arbitrary or irrational.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When drafting the regulations, the Secretary of State consulted with interested parties and he has complied with his obligations under European legislation—specifically with what is known as the transparency directive, or Council directive 89/105/EEC—by making the decision on the basis of a criterion that had been notified to the European Commission. The decision-making process was open and above board. For example, it was after consultation that the Secretary of State decided to extend the list of eligible patients and introduced the other modifications that we have discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall conclude my remarks so that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland may discuss other relevant matters. We have already made it clear that the policy that underlies the new arrangements will be reviewed after they have been in operation for a year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Brand</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to push the Minister on the legality of the fact that the guidance goes much further than do the regulations. The regulations are specific—they refer to diseases that may be suffered by a man—but the guidance appears to state that the man's condition must be caused by his disease. There is clearly a vast difference between the two. If I issued a prescription for Viagra to one of my patients who suffered from, for example, colour blindness, what would happen to me? If I did so, I would implicitly comply with the letter of the law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am advised that the regulations and the associated health service circular have been checked and cleared by the Parliamentary Counsel Office. They meet the policy intention that we set out. In relation to diabetes, for example, GPs are expected to exercise their clinical judgment. Diabetes may be diagnosed, and a GP may prescribe impotence treatment if the man is impotent. With single gene, neurological or other conditions—for example, colour blindness—it is reasonable to expect GPs to exercise their judgment when deciding whether a man has a relevant diagnosis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall review the policy that underlies the new arrangements when they have operated for a year. In the mean time, I commend the regulations and the associated guidance to the Committee. They represent a clear and workable outcome to a complex and difficult situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.57 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be helpful if I responded to the questions that were raised by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield and by my hon. Friend the Member for Greenock and Inverclyde. They asked reasonable questions about matters that have been devolved to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0129">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
the Scottish Parliament. As the hon. Member for Beaconsfield said, matters relating to the prescription of drugs have been devolved to the Scottish Parliament. I hope that I can reassure the hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend. Although we are discussing the regulations today—27 July—they have been, as my hon. Friend the Minister pointed out, in force since 1 July. We are not trying to impose regulations relating to matters that are better dealt with by the Scottish Parliament. We are debating the regulations long after they came into force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They were signed on 8 June and tabled on 10 June, so they are UK Government regulations that we were entitled to draw up and implement at that time.

Given that the UK Government wanted to introduce the regulations and prescribe Viagra for those conditions from 1 July, they could have said in June—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
