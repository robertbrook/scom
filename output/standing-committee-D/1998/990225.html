Draft European Communities (Definition of Treaties) (Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an Association between the European Communities and their Member States and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan) Order 1999</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Ms Joyce Quin)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft European Communities (Definition of Treaties) (Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an Association between the European Communities and their Member States and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan) Order 1999.</p></blockquote>
The debate focuses on an agreement that is designed to extend economic and political co-operation between the European Union and Jordan.<br><br>
The association agreement with Jordan was signed on 24 November 1997 and forms part of the EU's objective of creating a free trade area with the Mediterranean region by 2010. The agreement aims to strengthen relations through increased political, economic and commercial co-operation. It includes steps to liberalise trade and to harmonise Jordan's economic structures with the EU. That process should create new opportunities for trade and investment, bringing benefits to business and consumers in the EU.<br><br>
We believe that the agreement will help to create the right climate for stable economic and social development in Jordan. It provides for the improvement of political dialogue and co-operation on issues of mutual concern, such as drugs, the environment and transport. Committee members will have seen that the agreement goes into considerable detail on matters such as the environment, for which a list of useful areas of joint work is provided. That demonstrates the basis for future co-operation envisaged by the agreement.<br><br>
The agreement is an important development in the EU's relations with the Mediterranean. Once implemented, it will provide the basis for a new degree of communication and co-operation at all levels.<br><br>
Britain has taken a particular interest in the agreement. We have a longstanding and close relationship with Jordan, which was clearly demonstrated at the time of King Hussein's sad death. When the Prime Minister met King Abdullah shortly after his father's death, he assured the new King of Britain's solidarity and support at this time of transition for Jordan.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
At the General Affairs Council meeting of 22 February, I reiterated the UK's support for EU assistance to Jordan at this difficult time. Ministers concluded that the Commission should table proposals, which we look forward to receiving and discussing, for extra EU assistance to Jordan.<br><br>
As a result of the order, the UK will be the first member state to ratify the association agreement. That is an important point because it sends a clear signal of our close relationship with and commitment to Jordan. For that reason I ask the Committee to support these important objectives by approving the principles behind the agreement. I commend the order to the Committee.</span></p>
<p>4.34 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Trend <span class='memberconstituency'>(Windsor)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I welcome you to the Committee, Mr. Olner? I have never had the pleasure of serving on a Committee under your chairmanship. I also thank the Minister for introducing the order.<br><br>
The Committee will be familiar with similar agreements to that which is before us today—agreements with Tunisia, Morocco, Israel and an interim agreement with the Palestinian Liberation Organisation have already been established, and I understand that the order turns the interim agreement with Jordan into a full agreement. The Minister was right to say that many issues are covered by the agreements—human rights, democratic principles, trade, transport and the environment among others. The countries involved have also been considering ways of co-operating on anti-terrorism measures. That is to be welcomed.<br><br>
Euro-Med agreements must be kept under constant review. The tension between north and south is reflected in the tension between the south of Europe and the north of Africa and the near east. Developments in north African countries and the near east mean that the Mediterranean world is in a constant state of flux.<br><br>
Concern has been expressed in recent months about the south-south arrangements, between European Union and north African states, and the possible misuse of European funds. Will the Minister consider the recent report of the Court of Auditors, which criticised the Commission's management role in various programmes that are, broadly speaking, Euro-Med. The programmes were relaunched in April 1998 after the discovery of fraudulent activities in 1995–96. It is of real concern to hon. Members to ensure that such programmes are properly accounted for and can be signed off by the Court of Auditors. That point need not detain us now, but it is an aspect of the European Union's development that must be kept under close scrutiny.<br><br>
Jordan is a long-standing friend of this country, as the Minister said. She properly referred to the sad death of King Hussein. Jordan has a new King, and we wish him well. We wait to see how things will develop in the region. We wish the people of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan every joy in its new arrangement with the European Union and its member states.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0053">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
<p>4.37 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell <span class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Fife)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a timely opportunity to debate such issues, for the reasons given by the hon. Member for Windsor (Mr. Trend). I am concerned, however, about the general pace of the agreements. I am fairly certain that the agreement for Israel was considered in this Room in 1997. Perhaps in the Minister's reply—however curtailed it may be by the fact that we are sitting on a Thursday—she will indicate the timetable that is in mind. When will the free trade area, which the agreements seek to establish, be in place to the full extent that is proposed?<br><br>
The provisions of the agreement that are of considerable value are those that require regular political dialogue, especially at ministerial and senior official level, and the respect for democratic principles and human rights. The Minister will be aware that during consideration of the agreement on Israel, all Committee members who participated in the debate—including Ministers in the previous Government and the right hon. Member for Leeds, Central (Mr. Fatchett), who was then an Opposition Member—placed considerable stress on the fact that the right to suspend such agreements if parties consider that another party is failing to fulfil its obligations may arise in relation to human rights and failure to observe them properly. That is a matter of some significance, but perhaps we shall return to it. I view the regular political dialogue and respect for democratic principles and human rights as an extremely important part of the agreement.<br><br>
The economic provisions are virtually standard because they refer to the restriction of movement of capital between the Community and Jordan, the introduction of rules on competition within the free trade area within five years of the agreement coming into force, and economic co-operation in a wide range of areas, including education and training, science and technology, the environment, industry and investment. The agreement also provides for a dialogue on social and cultural matters and, perhaps of more significance, financial co-operation to help modernise the Jordanian economy and to promote private investment—all of which are to be kept under review by the establishment of an association council, which is to meet once a year at ministerial level to examine issues arising from the agreement and, in that, it is to be assisted by an association committee of senior officials.<br><br>
There is one point that I should make now, before going on to consider the issue of Jordan in particular. I want to make it plain that, in addition to being spokesman for my party, I am chairman of the Liberal Democrat Middle East Council, from which I obtained financial assistance for the purpose of research, and there is an appropriate entry in the Register of Members' Interests.<br><br>
Will the Minister confirm that the suspension of the agreement is competent if the European Union were to consider that Jordan, or indeed any other party to a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
similar agreement, had failed to fulfil obligations under the agreement, including proper respect for human rights?<br><br>
I associate myself with what has been said, both by the Minister and by the hon. Member for Windsor, about the tragedy that has struck Jordan with the death of King Hussein, who survived, sometimes almost literally, the assassin's bullet and the vicissitudes of political life in the middle east for more than 40 years by a remarkable combination of skill and courage. However, he did not always reach the right judgment: for example, during the Gulf war his initial conclusion was that there should be support for Iraq—a conclusion that was subsequently proved by events to have been erroneous.<br><br>
Not all of King Hussein's judgments were correct, but he survived and led his country in a remarkable way. Therefore, it is inevitable that as a result of his death Jordan is passing into a period of transition, which will be difficult for King Abdullah to manage. To the west, Israel, a country with which Jordan shares a border, is in the middle of an increasingly bitter general election, with the Arab-Israel peace process, one might charitably say, on hold—others more cynical might describe it less felicitously. On the other side, Jordan's eastern neighbour, Iraq, is engaged in a protracted confrontation with the United States and Britain, which is now taking place daily. Hardly a day goes by—it is perhaps a reflection on some of us that we have not been more active in pursuing this matter in the House—without some form of air operations, by either the United Kingdom or, more often, the United States, although usually with United Kingdom support, taking place in relation to both the northern and southern no-fly zones.<br><br>
To the east, that protracted confrontation is practically demonstrated in military operations. In addition, King Abdullah has to deal with a stagnant economy, which is currently unable to provide approximately one third of his countrymen with a living. Those who understand the politics of the middle east will know that unemployment of that kind can be deeply destabilising. Above all, Jordan requires a regional environment of peace and economic co-operation. That is why the agreement, in so far as it is a building block towards achieving that environment, is very important.<br><br>
I should like to encourage the Minister—and perhaps even the Prime Minister in the light of his announcements earlier this week—to consider greater European involvement in the middle east and greater initiatives by the European Union, in which the United Kingdom, because of its traditional links with Jordan, would be able to play a prominent part. I often think that policy on the middle east suffers from the fact that it is almost always United States led. There is a lot to be said for greater European influence. Because of our historical relationship and that of France, based on colonialism, we often have a different and better-informed understanding of issues in the middle east than the attitudes to be found on Capitol hill or in the

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
State Department in Washington. I welcome the order as part of what I hope will be a broader and more proactive approach by the European Union.<br><br>
Since the death of King Hussein and the arrival of King Abdullah on the throne, there seems to have been a move towards Baghdad. The official Iraqi newsagency, INA, stated that the new monach
<br><blockquote><p>"wanted to pursue bilateral relations and examine ways of developing them in the interest of the two brotherly peoples".</p></blockquote>
We must take anything that is said by the official Iraqi newsagency with a substantial sack of salt because it has an agenda to serve. But there is other evidence to suggest that King Abdullah may, for a variety of reasons, be turning towards Baghdad more than his predecessor. Some would say that in the fragile circumstances in which Jordan finds itself, such pro-Iraqi sentiments would be a shrewd movement. To ensure that support at home during the difficult period of transition can be shored up, it would make sense for Jordan to show greater even-handedness with Iraq. It is important that we do not allow that to develop in a vacuum.<br><br>
President Clinton, President Chirac and Chancellor Schröder have all told King Abdullah that they would press for a significant debt reduction with their Group of Seven counterparts. Debt reduction has been envisaged by the Jubilee 2000 campaign and similar campaigns. I pay tribute to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who seems to have made considerable progress over the weekend, not least in persuading the German Government who, under Chancellor Kohl were a little less susceptible to persuasion on the topic of debt reduction. Here is a practical example of how debt reduction during a period of fragility and transition could be a significant feature in serving to create the economic development that is clearly essential if the period of transition is to be successfully accommodated.<br><br>
The International Monetary Fund is about to reach an agreement with Jordan on a structural reform programme underpinned by a new, three-year extended funding facility. Both in Jordan and among what might loosely be called the western allies, that is seen as a very important effort to bring a boost to a stagnant economy.<br><br>
Our discussion today is timely because the mechanisms that the agreement seeks to reach by co-operation and agreement are clearly significant and important to Jordan at this time. For that reason, I am happy to give the agreement more than a favourable wind in the belief that it is an important signpost in the difficult period of transition to which I referred. It is vital that we do not allow a vacuum to be created around Jordan that might be filled by countries with a less benevolent approach to Jordan or the west in general.<br><br>
For those reasons I am happy to accept the Minister's brief and succinct commendation of the agreement to the Committee.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
<p>4.50 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Windsor and the right hon. and learned Member for North-East Fife (Mr. Campbell) for their contributions, and for their general and positive remarks about the agreement.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Windsor, who leads for the Opposition on this matter, raised a number of specific issues, to which I shall seek to respond.<br><br>
The agreement permits the possibility of working with Jordan on organised crime. Drugs are specifically mentioned, but it is also possible and desirable to strengthen joint work on organised crime.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also said that we should keep these agreements as part of the Mediterranean strategy under constant review. That is a sensible point, but it is already addressed by the Council of Ministers in its deliberations on Mediterranean issues. Mediterranean issues might seem to be of particular interest and concern to the neighbouring southern countries of the European Union, but in reality they are of interest to us all. I take the point, which fits in with one of the comments made by the right hon. and learned Gentleman, that we need to see these issues in their wider context and make sure that we give them the importance that they deserve.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman referred to the misuse of European funds, and I agree with him. There have been instances of fraud and misuse of funds in relation to aid programmes, including the Mediterranean programme. The Court of Auditors found that some of the decentralised programmes in the Euro-Med area were badly run, so they will be relaunched later this year. We shall closely examine new arrangements proposed to make sure that mistakes are not repeated and that the various mechanisms are in place to safeguard to the maximum extent possible the proper use of the funds in the future.<br><br>
As the hon. Gentleman said, wider debates are taking place about fraud and mismanagement. I cannot speak about them at length without going out of order, but I welcome the deadline set in the European Parliament and some of the initiatives taken by Governments, including our own, to tackle the issues and make sure that mismanagement and outright fraud are properly dealt with. The right hon. and learned Member for North-East Fife mentioned the timing of the agreements. He is right to refer to the number of agreements already in place. The aim is to achieve the overall free trade area by 2010, but we must consider what is happening in individual countries. We must keep the end goal in mind, but we must be sensitive and respond to positive or negative changes and developments in those countries.<br><br>
The right hon. and learned Gentleman also asked whether it would be possible to suspend the agreement if human rights commitments entered into were not being respected. The answer is yes. The association council will provide a forum for dialogue with Jordan on human rights issues. If it failed to resolve a specific problem that member states were concerned about, the European Union could take action, by suspending all
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0055">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
or part of the agreement. Therefore, the agreement contains that flexibility, so that countries can look together at any problem case by case. The human rights chapter is an important part of the agreement and has become increasingly important as agreements have been reached with individual countries in recent years.<br><br>
The right hon. and learned Gentleman encouraged Ministers to be proactive. I feel that we already are. The European Union as a whole, in financial terms, has been very supportive of the peace process and of programmes for countries in the region. Politically, as the right hon. and learned Gentleman said, the high profile has often been occupied by the Americans, but the European Union has a reasonable record in practical assistance that is seldom given the prominence that it deserves. I agree that we should seek every opportunity to be proactive and take supportive initiatives.<br><br>
I also agreed with the latter part of the right hon. and learned Gentleman's comments in which he referred to the importance of the transition period that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
Jordan is going through and the need not to isolate Jordan but to make sure that it is part of our diplomatic and financial and economic efforts.<br><br>
I believe that the agreement with Jordan represents an important development in the European Union's external political, trade and economic relations and is consistent with Government policy in Jordan.<br><br>
I agree with the comments made by members of the Committee. I hope that we can therefore give our firm support today to this new agreement and be the first country to ratify it.</span></p>
