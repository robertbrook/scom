	<div class='page-header'><h1>Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill</h1></div>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 44</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>BEREAVEMENT PAYMENTS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed [this day):</i> No. 202, in page 39, line 34, after "day", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"or a bereaved person aged 60 to 64 when the spouse died.".—[	<i>Mr. Pickles.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>2.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking amendment No. 102, in page 39, line 39, leave out "and" and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"or
	<br><blockquote><p>() that the person was of pensionable age and in receipt of income support; and".</p></blockquote></p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kali Mountford 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Colne Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ordinarily, Mr. McWilliam, I would hope that you had a substantial and enjoyable lunch, However, given that lunchtime today was quite grim, I am in a less than jocular mood. All Committee members doubtless feel the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before lunch, we were discussing the support that a Government should provide for society in general, and those on whom particular attention should be focused. Opposition Members' view of women and their prospects—which I do not share—surprised me, given the thoroughness with which, during the previous debate on pensions, the hon. Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) discussed the current prospects for women in work. Women who suffer in bereavement also suffer from pension splitting, and we must remember that, as the hon. Lady pointed out, 70 per cent. of married women are in work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric Pickles 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brentwood and Ongar)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I respectfully remind the hon. Lady that the amendment relates to women between the ages of 60 and 64?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kali Mountford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's point, but earlier contributions from Opposition Members, to which I felt it appropriate to respond, ranged rather more widely than the subject of women aged between 60 and 64. We must have cognisance of changes to future working patterns, particularly in relation to European law. The hon. Gentleman forgets that women can—in this House, they often do—work beyond the age 60. There is no reason why they should not do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why should men and women be treated differently? It is entirely appropriate for benefits to be extended to bereaved men. The points made on bereavement were
	<span class='label label-info column'>490</span>
well made, but there is no reason to assume that a man who loses his spouse is any less bereaved than a woman who loses her spouse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Julian Brazier 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Canterbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is right to say that bereavement affects men and women equally—I have two friends who are widowers, both of whom support children, as it happens. However, she must accept that there is a considerable economic difference, to which many of her hon. Friends drew attention on Second Reading: a great many of the 70 per cent. of women in work have low-paid jobs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kali Mountford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a good point about the economic prospects of women. He should consider the wide-ranging measures that the Government are implementing to provide support for families—particularly women in work—to which I referred earlier. The minimum wage provides disproportionate help for women because they tend to be paid less than men. However, other measures are available to everyone in their quest to improve their prospects. Surely, the House would not argue that women's prospects should not be improved and that women should remain in low-paid employment. We should consider the lot of women overall and try to help them live independently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) mentioned children, on whom we should focus our support. What matters most are the children of the family and the ability of their parents to support them. The ability to support children must be shared equally between the husband and wife—the parents—while they are alive and working or, indeed, if they are sadly bereaved. There is no justification for not acknowledging that the Bill contains proper measures to support children. Opposition Members are more concerned with focusing on the prospects of women and their ability to cope. I have not heard an argument to support that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mark Oaten 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Winchester)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady wants to hear an argument. There is no disagreement on the need to treat men and women equally. She is making a number of assertions, but missing the point. Our argument is that the measures will not help elderly women who are over 65. We want to target help for those elderly people who will be hit badly by the measures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kali Mountford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's argument, but he is missing the point. A wide range of other measures are available to support not just women of working age or in retirement, but others. I have heard no reason why we should treat people differently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Rendel 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady said that there are other measures. What other measures help the elderly bereaved?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kali Mountford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman draws a distinction between the elderly bereaved and other elderly people. The argument so far has focused on the contribution principle to justify why people of that age, in those circumstances, should be treated differently. The hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel) will recall that after 12 months in office, the Conservative party
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0742">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>491</span>
changed the contributory principle, which it now holds so dear, when it altered the pension rules for unemployment benefit, it took away the right of people with occupational pensions to be entitled to unemployment benefit when that benefit applied to their wives. That principle did not matter to the Conservatives then and it does not matter to them now. As ever, they have changed their minds. It appears that one does not have to be responsible in Opposition, but one does have to be responsible in government. The thrust of my argument is that we must focus on those people who need help most and for whom no other help is available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howard Flight 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Arundel and South Downs)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The changes to SERPS were made in 1986 to apply in 1999. That gave 13 years' notice. These proposed changes are immediate and there is no time for people to adjust.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kali Mountford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman referred to the changes that were made by his Government in 1985. I was talking about a change that was made in 1980–81 to unemployment benefit, which is more analogous to what we are debating. Although there was notice of his Government's change to SERPS, I would like to know where it was given because the people who sent letters to my post bag did not know about it. I cannot accept his argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Governments must consider the overall resources that are available for spending and where they are placed. Opposition Members have not told us what the impact would be on the Budget if we extended the range of bereavement benefits to men, which I believe is the right thing to do, without changing the focus of benefits overall to children, which I also think is right. I usually carry the Red Book around with me—it is dear to my heart and I love it—but I do not have it with me today, so I cannot check what the impact of the changes will be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kali Mountford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, if I really must.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall simply tell the hon. Lady that the effect, according to the Red Book, is straightforward. Through these measures, the Government will save £550 million a year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kali Mountford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall check the hon. Gentleman's figures, but whatever the figure, that amount is to be refocused on children. That is my point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My other point is that the hon. Gentleman's opposition to these measures implies that he must be suggesting further expenditure. Is he suggesting not spending more money and not changing the focus of benefits? Surely his proposals would involve extra expense for the Exchequer? No other argument would make sense. I see that no Opposition Member will now intervene to tell me how they would find that money. That is a pity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the duty of the Government to spend taxpayers' money appropriately. I have never heard either party say that it should not be spent appropriately, but one must be able to say where one would get the money from. It is right to have a balanced budget that is focused on children, which is what these measures will achieve. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>492</span>
hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) seems amused by the idea of focusing on children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I was just casting my mind back to the banners that I used to see outside the House, which said, "Stop the Tory cuts." Now, obviously, those banners would have to read, "Stop new Labour's refocus."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kali Mountford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a bit of fun for our debate, but it did not take us any further forward. Refocusing is an appropriate way to deal with the matter, because one has to think about who needs to benefit the most.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rendel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The proposal in the Modernisation Committee report to have a Second Reading debate on a clause before the amendments are dealt with is looking increasingly attractive to me, because that is what we seem to be doing now. Could we please come back to the narrower debate on the amendments? It is time that we made some progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kali Mountford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with you, Mr. McWilliam. Although I enjoyed hon. Member's interventions, they took me completely off track and I apologise for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rendel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to talk about the amendment, which will get the hon. Lady back on track. What she appears to be saying is that the proposal will focus money where it is most needed. I put it to her that the over-65s who are on income support are more needy that the under-60s who are not on income support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kali Mountford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has already made that point. I shall tell him again that, as part of overall expenditure of the Government, measures are in place to support people in retirement. The hon. Member for Newbury is shaking his head, but there are such measures. Measures are in place to support people who are out of work, and people who are trying to get back into work, where that is appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rendel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kali Mountford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise. I was coming to a close. I fear that the hon. Gentleman will take me wide of the mark again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rendel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the contrary, I am trying to be more specific.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kali Mountford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is my contention that the proposals are to he supported. I support them for the reasons that I have given and I am happy to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to stick much more closely to the terms of the amendments. I agree with the hon. Member for Colne Valley (Kali Mountford) that there is not a great deal of difference between us on the principle that men should have access to bereavement benefits. Indeed, I was the sponsor of a ten-minute Bill on that subject introduced by the late Mrs. Chaplin, the former hon. Member for Newbury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to put the terms of the debate into context, based on information that the Library has produced. In the 1960s, the number of widows claiming benefits was, on average, 600,000, which was, at that time, about 5 per cent. of the social security budget. Now, probably
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0743">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>493</span>
because of the greater wealth in the economy and our better health service, the number of women claiming the benefit is about 283,600, which represents about 1 per cent. of social security spending. In essence, the Government are trying to chop a budget that is already diminishing. Perhaps that puts into context where the arguments on our side of the debate are coming from. I shall concentrate on the amendment, although I have no disagreement with amendment No. 102, by discussing the effect of taking the bereavement payment away from those who are over 60. We should not forget, however, that no alternative benefit will be in place for a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Taking the bereavement payment away, especially from those in the lower income brackets, will have various consequences. Although the payment was not intended to be used for funeral expenses, there has been a presumption that it should be used in that way. When the over-60s can no longer claim the payment, recourse to the social fund will be necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
2.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To put on a hat from my former career in Hastings for a moment, I know that the distribution of social fund money to various social security offices was based on the historical distribution of social benefits. For example, areas with high unemployment took an unduly large proportion of the total social fund budget. The changed structure of the society in Hastings meant that I was able to realise a 60 per cent. increase in the money that was available to the Benefits Agency, which was used to relieve demands on the social fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether the distribution of social fund money to the Benefits Agency reflects modern circumstances—as I said, in Hastings it was based on an historical distribution. The fact that the poorer income groups are likely to retire to certain areas means that elderly people who do not have access to the bereavement fund will put excess pressure on social fund payments. What are the Minister, the Benefits Agency and the Department of Social Security doing to ensure that people who have to claim social fund payments to bury their loved ones with a degree of respect have access to sufficient funds? How will they ensure that those people are not refused access by social fund officers? It is crucial to deal with that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I were a Minister, I would not want to deal with the public relations disaster that might result. It would be similar to the situation in 1978, when people could not bury their loved ones because porters refused to move dead bodies in hospitals and cemetery workers would not work in cemeteries. For once, I take the Government's side—I advise them to deal with the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security (Mr. Stephen Timms)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar to the front line—he will be his party's Front-Bench spokesman for this part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is very gracious.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I like to be gracious. I suspect that Committee members will forgive the hon. Gentleman if the quantity and length of his contributions are not as great as those of the Member for Grantham and Stamford
	<span class='label label-info column'>494</span>
(Mr. Davies), although I am sure that the quality of his contributions will be just as high. He has already given us evidence of that this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that I speak for all Committee members in wishing my hon. Friend the Member for City of Chester (Ms Russell) many happy returns of the day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I listened to Conservative Members' speeches this morning, I wondered where they had been for the 18 years before the previous general election. We are now in the era of confessional conservatism, and I suspect that before we conclude our consideration of this part of the Bill we shall have heard a few more abject apologies from Conservative Members for the actions that the previous Government took—we are certainly entitled to such apologies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The benefits system is in desperate need of reform because the previous Government undermined it for 18 years. They left a disastrous legacy and none of the crocodile tears to which we were treated this morning will erase that stain—those Conservative Members supported the previous Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The truth is that we are right to modernise bereavement benefit. Huge changes have taken place since the modern system was introduced more than 50 years ago. Leaving the system unchanged reduces public support for welfare and undermines it in the long term. Those of us who believe in welfare must keep the system continuously under review and up to date. The system faces big new demands in the years ahead. People are living longer, and—as the royal commission recently reminded us there will be big new demands for long-term care. We are planning ahead, and we will achieve a system that meets those challenges—[	<i>Interruruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford should not heckle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unlike the previous Government, we believe in welfare. That is why we are building a durable welfare system for the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The benefit system is hugely out of date as regards bereavement. It does nothing for bereaved fathers. I am glad that the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) has joined the Committee and I commend him for welcoming our changes to enable men to receive help on bereavement for the first time. No other Conservative Member mentioned that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford and I did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

At present, 15,000 people a year are widowed and receive no help because they are men. I would be grateful to the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford—who is about to intervene—if he could explain why the Conservative party did nothing about that in its 18 years in government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Grantham and Stamford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I just wanted to correct the record by my intervention. Not only did I mention the fact, but I anticipated—correctly, as it has turned out—that the Minister, when winding up the discussion, would not deal with the essential issue of the net transfer of one half of £1 billion from widows to the Treasury, but that he would attempt to disguise that fact by focusing on the £100 million transfer of resources, much of which will be in favour of men. That is the course that I predicted he would follow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has not answered my question, which is not surprising. On this issue and on many others, the previous Government's record was disgraceful. Our proposals to cover men and women equally for the first time have been widely welcomed. As my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary said in response to the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar, we are creating an entirely new and wholly contributory benefit, which extends the reach of the contributory benefit system to people who have not previously benefited from it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I give way to the hon. Gentleman, I want to respond to the point made by the hon. Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten) He said that there was no dispute in the Committee about whether the benefit should be extended to men. That may be right, but I am not sure of the Conservative party's position on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Conservative Members are in favour of the extension.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman saying that he is in favour of extending the present system to men? If the answer is yes, how does he intend to pay for it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Bearing in mind the present reforms, which should take one half of £1 billion from widows and transfer it into the Chancellor's back pocket, that is not a hard problem. The hon. Gentleman must address the piece of paper that I see in front of him—the "Budget 99" document. How will he fulfil the Chancellor's promise, which relates to the amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw his reference to the Chancellor's back pocket and insert Chancellor's Treasury pocket.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. The Chancellor's Treasury pocket, which he may well keep on his back.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand why the hon. Gentleman moved quickly on to a different subject. In the long term, he is advocating—I do not know whether he has discussed this with the shadow Chancellor—£500 million a year extra spending beyond current Treasury projections. It would be interesting to know how he proposes to pay for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe in debate as opposed to aversion, so I shall reply to the Minister and I hope that he will reply to my point. The Government's proposals will simply put more and more widows and widowers into the dependency trap because they will have to rely increasingly on means-tested benefit. That is how the Conservative party's proposals differ from the Government's.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>496</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is simply wrong. Our proposals will not make more widowers dependent. We are creating a new contributory non-means-tested benefit for widowers, which has never existed before.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rendel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point to which I wanted to respond was made some while back. The Minister suggested that the Government had received widespread support for the move to include widowers along with widows in the provision of benefits. I do not deny that for a moment; that move has, and has always had, Liberal Democrat support. We are not guilty of having failed in the previous Government to do anything about that, as the Minister accused the Conservatives of being. Does the Minister think that there is also widespread support for the £500 million overall cut in benefits to widows?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is strong support for our programme of modernising the benefit system, of which this provision is part. However, it requires making some hard decisions of the sort that Liberal Democrats signally fail to address.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rendel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister accuses us of failing to take hard decisioncrats signally fail to address.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rendel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister accuses us of failing to take hard decisions, but he might remember that, during the Budget debate, we opposed the cut in income tax to 22p. There are ways in which this sort of measure can be funded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no doubt that, it is simply that during the course of the Committee's proceedings, we shall spend the famous Liberal Democrat penny on income tax several times over. We shall return to that subject during our deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other reason why the current system is woefully out of date is because, as hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have said, seven out of 10 married women now work, compared with one in eight when the system was introduced. The assumption in the past was that wives were wholly dependent on their husbands. That is simply no longer true. My hon. Friend the Member for Colne Valley was absolutely right when she said in her excellent speech that 40 per cent. of those who receive widows benefits are in the top half of the income distribution scale. So, they are not dependent in the way the system assumed in the past. The system must keep up with the changes that are happening around us. It is no good simply arguing that more money should be given to everybody. While that sounds like a nice approach and, no doubt, goes down well in some circles, I am surprised to hear it coming from Conservative Members. In reality, it simply undermines support for the system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister apply the same principle to the pension system?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am unsure to what that question relates. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will come back on that later during my speech. It certainly is the case that we are also modernising the pension system. The approach that advocates giving more money to everyone undermines the welfare system and damages the interests of the people whose well-being depends on it. A weakened system is not good for those whose interests we are committed to upholding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to the fact that 40 per cent. of widows are in the top half of the income scale. With reference to the amendment, can he say what percentage of widows over 60 are in the lower 40 per cent.?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming shortly to the Conservative amendment, when I shall deal with those issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are equipping Britain with a modern, decent welfare system, which is the right thing to do. That requires making some difficult judgments about the right way forward. I am confident that our judgments are the right ones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Gainsborough proposed several tests for the proposals. I see that he has left the Committee, but I want to respond briefly to the points that he made. On the basis of our proposals, no one who currently receives widow's benefit will be worse off. If he is suggesting that no one in those difficult circumstance should receive less under the new arrangements than he or she would have done under the old, no reform would ever take place. Opposition Members spent their lives under the previous Government voting for measures that flouted that principle, so we shall not take lectures on that from them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Widows and widowers with child care responsibilities will be particularly helped under our proposals through the widowed parent's allowance. As my hon. Friend the Member for Colne Valley said, they are the people—both men and women—who need the help most.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar asked me to comment on the press release that he referred to this morning and I am glad to do so. The Inland Revenue issued the press release on changes to tax allowances at the time of the Budget. The Chancellor announced in the Budget the abolition of the widow's bereavement tax allowance, which will be worth up to £197 in the financial year ahead. It was suggested in The press release that the new increased bereavement payment would compensate for the ending of that allowance. However, the hon. Gentleman is right to say that that is not the case because that payment is not available to those widows who are over retirement age. For that reason, the Inland Revenue has publicly acknowledged that it made a mistake in the press release.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The allowance is normally available in the year that the woman is widowed and in the following year if she does not remarry. That is being challenged under the European convention on human rights as being discriminatory. Of course, widows will benefit from the new 10p tax rate and next year's cut in the basic tax rate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rendel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has rightly accepted that the Inland Revenue was wrong to put out the press release in the form that it did and that it was wrong simply because some people will not benefit from the new bereavement payment. Does he also accept that there is a year's gap? For a year, no one will receive recompense from the bereavement payment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>498</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is true. The 22p tax rate will begin in the coming year, but what the hon. Gentleman says about the bereavement payment is right; it will not apply in the coming financial year, which is made clear in the consultation document.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Who put out that inaccurate and deceptive press release? Was it the Minister himself, or was it Mr. Alastair Campbell?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was the Inland Revenue and officials at the Inland Revenue publicly acknowledged that they made a mistake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Beckenham made an interesting point about the social fund. She seemed to be under the impression that we were withdrawing the bereavement payments for people in the 60 to 64 age bracket. Of course, that is not the case—the one-off payment has never been available to people beyond retirement age, so we are making no change in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, what change there is will be entirely positive—the amount that will be paid is being increased and it will be available to everyone to whom the current £1,000 payment is available. Nevertheless, I assure the hon. Lady that social fund funeral grants, about which she rightly expressed concern because of her experience in such matters, are not cash-limited. So the problem that the hon. Lady referred to will not arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The current system of bereavement benefits does not do enough to help those who need help the most. That is why we are doubling the financial help available immediately on bereavement and why we are focusing the new benefits to support widows and widowers with dependent children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rendel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has said that he wants to focus help on those who need it most, but he has also said that he is doubling the bereavement payment. Presumably that payment will apply to the 40 per cent. of widows who are comparatively well off. Why does he not spread the money available for bereavement benefit not only to those 40 per cent., but to the poorer, more elderly pensioners who are on income support?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to the amendment. We accept that widows and widowers of working age are entitled to help under the new arrangements, irrespective of their financial circumstances. It is a contributory benefit that will not be means-tested. We believe that that is right. We are not advocating that bereavement benefits should be means-tested in the way that the hon. Gentleman's question implied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rendel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that it is a contributory benefit, so why does it matter if the person is still working? If people have paid contributions throughout their working life, why are they not entitled to the benefit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The basis of the national insurance and contributory benefit systems is that certain benefits, including widow's benefit in the past, are for people of working age. I noted the murmur of support for the hon. Member for Newbury from Conservative Members but
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0746">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>499</span>
the Conservative Government did nothing in their 18 years to change the national insurance system. The point of the system is to provide insurance against loss of income and security through widowhood, but it does not apply to those who have already retired. The system has always functioned on that basis and that is how it should continue to operate. We are giving extra help, through secondary legislation, to the least well off widowed parents, with a new disregard in income related benefits. We are focusing resources to provide the greatest help for those with the greatest need.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Levitt 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(High Peak)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I commend the speech of my hon. Friend the Minister of State and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Colne Valley. They are the only two that have tackled the big picture. Perhaps I could add to the list that my hon. Friend the Minister is going through and point out that the new deal for the over-50s, which is a scheme that will assist all those who are over 50 and genuinely looking for work, will apply to widows and widowers as well. That is more help for the older generation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. He is right to draw the Committee's attention to that major improvement, which was announced in the Budget by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the concerns that may have led the hon. Member for Newbury to table amendment No. 102, but it is the wrong way to deal with his concerns. His amendment is intended to extend eligibility for the bereavement payment to widows and widowers of pensionable age who receive income support. Technically, it would not quite do that, but nevertheless, his arguments are important and I shall respond to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments strike against a principle that has been at the heart of widows benefit since Beveridge. Widows benefits have always been an insurance against unexpected death in working life. They are not intended to be compensation for the inevitable fact that all of us will die one day. They were intended for, and will continue to be paid to, people of working age. The purpose of the bereavement payment, as with the widows payment that it replaces, is to provide immediate help to those of working age in meeting the unexpected costs that arise on bereavement. We recognise the great importance of having swift help that is not means-tested. That is why we have doubled the value of the payment from £1,000 to £2,000, to be given when it is most needed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rendel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has been generous in giving way. Whatever the original aim of the payment, surely we should be thinking about the right place to focus it now. He said that the benefit was purely for those of working age. But surely people above working age are often poorer than those who are of working age. We should be thinking about who are the people who most need it. Whatever Beveridge's original intention on insurance being for people of working age only, the Minister should now be thinking of the poorest people—those who need the payout most—who are above working age, which is why it is important to extend the benefit to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>500</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Support is already available to pensioners. In many respects, state provision for those who are widowed and over pensionable age is already more generous than for those who are under pensionable age. The social fund is available to help the least well off with funeral expenses, which picks up the point that amendment No. 102 raises. It refers specifically to pensioners receiving income support. We pledged the new minimum income guarantee to give extra help to pensioners with the lowest incomes. I am glad that the Liberal Democrats support our proposal to increase the minimum income guarantee over time, as resources allow, in line with earnings. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced in the Budget that that will be increased in line with earnings from next year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be my fault, but I am confused about the term "people of working age" because I understand that, at present, the state pension is paid to men at the age of 65 and to women at 60. The previous Conservative Government passed legislation ensuring that women would receive the state pension from the age of 65. I would suggest, if I may be so bold, that any court judgment from the European Court would look to the legislation that will come in, equalising the age at 65, which would make the Conservative amendment acceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Actually, it would make it redundant. When women do not retire until 65, women aged from 60 to 65 will be entitled to the benefits of the arrangements, so the amendment will be unnecessary. I was about to make that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend also announced a substantial rise in tax allowances in retirement and there will be a fuel payment of £100 for more than 7 million pensioner households. The arrangements for stakeholder pensions and pension sharing on divorce will help to provide fairness and security as well. That is the right way to help pensioners. It is important to focus on the purpose of the benefit, and I have to say to the hon. Member for Newbury that it would be dangerous to arbitrarily extend it beyond the purpose for which it exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 202 is also aimed at extending eligibility for bereavement benefit. Following the point made by the hon. Member for Beckenham, the clause will already allow men aged 60 to 64 to claim a bereavement payment when they are widowed because they will not be at retirement age. When the pension ages for men and women are equalised at 65, women in that age group will qualify as well. The amendment would allow retrospective claims from any widower who happened to be aged between 60 and 64 when his wife died. That would mean, for example, that someone in his mid-90s who was widowed 30 years ago would suddenly find that he was entitled to a bereavement payment. I imagine that that was not the intention of the amendment, but that is what it would do, as it is drafted. It would not be a sensible change to the clause to make the provision retrospective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friends would agree that if the Minister accepted the tenor of the amendment, we should be happy for him to take it away and redraft it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0747">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>501</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not necessary to have the amendment at all, and I urge the Committee to reject it. Both amendments would weaken the principles that underpin our reforms. The reforms are right. The modernisation that we propose is necessary. Our proposals will focus help on those who need it most, and I commend them to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall eschew all references to bike sheds, to refocusing or to all the interesting revelations that have come out of the debate, including that of the Under-Secretary that he has never met Alastair Campbell. I think that that is a badge of honour for a Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
3.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall concentrate on the amendment and examine the Minister's reasons for refusing it. He says that this is all a terrible mistake, that the Inland Revenue got it wrong, that what it said in its press release was inaccurate and that widows will not be more than compensated for the loss of the allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must consider the Government's intentions. I am thinking of the Chancellor of the Exchequer at No. 11 Downing street in his famous office with no carpets—all very dour and very efficient.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Minimalist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Dour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Chancellor sat down and put his proposals together, he must have thought, "Well, we'll get rid of married couples allowance, which will mean that widows bereavement allowance will go, but everything will be okay because the bereavement payment will take care of them." I believe that that was his intention. That will not happen because of a technicality: widows between the ages of 60 and 64 are not entitled to the bereavement payment. I do not think that the right hon. Gentleman knew that. I think that it was his intention to make the payment. Bereavement payments can be made to those aged 45 to 60, and married couples allowance will stay for a time for those aged 65-plus, although that will create anomalies. The amendment simply deals with widows between the ages of 60 and 64.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says, "Well, the payment is redundant because things are moving along." We accept that retirement matters are changing, but that further shows that it would be relatively easy and very cheap for the Government to implement our proposal. There is no real long-term disadvantage because, as my hon. Friends made clear, this is a cutting measure—it will cut expenditure. Any slight, temporary blip in that gradual decline will not be noticed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is saying that the Government are worried that people in their 90s or 100s might make claims dating back 30 years, that is, of course, not our intention. We would happily withdraw the amendment; it is partly probing. However, the Government say that a mistake has been made and that it is not a printing mistake, but a mistake of intent. I do not believe that that it is a mistake of intent. I genuinely believe that when the Chancellor introduced the measure, he thought that everyone who benefited from the bereavement
	<span class='label label-info column'>502</span>
allowance would be compensated by the bereavement payment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's intention to hide behind a technicality does not bode well for the treatment of widows. For that reason, I will press the amendment to a Division. We also intend to support amendment No. 102, which was tabled by the Liberal Democrats.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rendel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Labour Members made only speeches in opposition to the amendments. I should like to deal with both of those speeches briefly. I have seldom heard such a flurry of interventions. Perhaps it was easy to put forward counter-arguments because Labour's arguments were so poor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Colne Valley said that there were other measures—the Minister repeated the assertion—to help pensioners. I challenged her to produce another measure that would help pensioners with the costs of bereavement. She could not, and neither could the Minister. Clause 44 is specifically about who gets bereavement payments and how big they should be. We are being asked to accept that the Government have allocated a pot of money to bereavement payments. That is fair enough. We understand that they need an overall budget, some of which they might want to allocate to bereavement payments. However, the Government argue that the overall fixed sum—they say that it cannot be increased—should be focused on those who need it most. They believe that they can afford to cut widow's benefits because comparatively wealthy widows do not need the money, but their method of allocating bereavement payments does not support their argument. According to their own terms, the clause is a failure. It does not do what they claim they want to do, which is why it should be amended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The money is meant to help with the special costs of bereavement—for example, to pay for the funeral or to pay off the deceased's debts. Labour Members argued that we do not have to extend bereavement payments to the elderly on income support because other help is available to pensioners, but those payments are not for the particular costs that are incurred on bereavement; they cover normal living costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned winter fuel payments. Is he saying that the £100 winter fuel payment is used for winter fuel throughout a person's pensionable age, which could be 30 years, except for the one year when a spouse dies, when it is used to cover bereavement costs? It is nonsense to suggest that winter fuel payments should be allocated to cover the costs of bereavement. A similar argument would apply to all the extra help for pensioners that the Government mentioned because those payments are also designed to be used throughout a person's pensionable age. It is ridiculous to pretend that for one year—hopefully, it will only be one year—they can be used to cover bereavement. The Government's argument that they are giving extra help to pensioners falls. It is illogical. We should be deciding how the pot can best be spent so that it is shared fairly between those who need it most. The fairest way to do that would be to ensure that it goes to the least well off. What better way to do that than to give it to those on income support? It would be better
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0748">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>503</span>
still if we could also give it to pensioners who should be on income support but who, for whatever reason, are not claiming it, but we have had that argument with the Government. Until we can ensure that everyone who is eligible for income support is getting it, we should target those on income support because they will be among the least well off of all pensioners. That is why we have tabled the amendment, which the Government have not made a case for opposing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the benefits system needs to be reviewed. We do not deny that. What we are saying is that it is wrong to pick money from widows to allow the Government to cut their costs and, perhaps, to introduce tax cuts in other ways. Interestingly, the Government's proposal to review benefits means that if you are a woman, you should consider suffocating your husband—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is self-evident that I am not a woman, and my wife would be extremely surprised to discover that I had a husband.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's proposal involves an anomaly. The time at which a man will be least at risk of domestic violence from his wife is between 5 April next year and 6 April the year after. The situation is absurd. However, I am happy to learn that during that year I shall be less at risk than I otherwise will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The bereavement payments are intended not to replace lost income but to help with the extra costs of being bereaved. Those costs are as great if one is of working age or if one is beyond it. Although the Bill may not have been designed to help people who are beyond working age, the contributions that men and women make during their working lives could be used as an insurance against the extra costs of bereavement, whenever those costs accrue. The Government should use the bereavement payment fund as fairly as possible and ensure that it benefits those who are least well off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already discussed the costs of the proposals. I understand from a Government response to an earlier question of mine that our amendment would cost about £60 million a year. As we heard earlier, the Government's spending on widows will be reduced by
	<span class='label label-info column'>504</span>
£500 million. We have tabled amendments, which we shall come to later, which will eat into some of that cut. The Government should not have reduced the overall level of widows payments. The amendment would not cost more than one ninth or one tenth of the total amount of the cut, and we therefore feel that it is justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have proposed their changes not because the proposals are fair but because they want to cut the overall level of bereavements benefits, which we oppose doing. Even if it were right to make that cut—perhaps in order to introduce tax cuts for other people—the Government should ensure that the money that is left is spent fairly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You have followed the custom, Mr. McWilliam, of allowing a slightly wider debate on the first amendment relating to a new part of a Bill than the amendment's wording would otherwise allow. In response to some extraordinary remarks that I heard from Labour Members, I want to make one general remark, which applies to the clause, and to which I shall return in more detail when we come to clause 45. The message on which the Government were elected was that changes in welfare would be governed by the principle of a hand up, not a hand out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's proposal for bereavement payments for elderly people sends a signal—one among many—that those who have helped themselves, and whose husbands have helped their families, will do less well than those who have not helped themselves, for whatever reason. This is yet another example of the Government saying one thing in Opposition and doing something else in government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I remind the Committee that the amendments deal only with voluntary contributions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You are right to make that point, Mr. McWilliam.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a probing amendment that will provide the only opportunity to consider the fate of those who make voluntary contributions. In many ways, the provision is the most remarkable example of the breaking of the contract between the state and the public. That contract is straightforward: if I make a contribution, the state will ensure that, in the event of my untimely demise, a sum of money will be paid regularly to my loved one. No example could be more obvious and extreme than that of the person who has made voluntary contributions to the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It emerged that part of the intention behind the provision is the saving of £500 million a year. It is ironic that a measure intended to create equality will actually work to the detriment of women. This measure is a clear example of that. One of the reasons why there has not so far been the outcry that there will be about these measures is that widows are a soft target. The majority of people who will be the victims of the proposals still do not know their fate, for the macabre reason that they do not know that they will be deprived of the company and support of their husbands. Their husbands are going about their ordinary daily lives under the false premise that the contributions that they have made will ensure that their widows will receive a pension. That is especially acute in the case of those who have made a voluntary payment, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith) referred on Second Reading. That principally involves those who have been in the armed forces and subsequently spent some time abroad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>506</span>
I received a letter from a gentleman on precisely that issue. He is keen that his name and address should not be mentioned, but I am happy for hon. Members to read the letter, if they wish. He says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am 65 years of age and a state pensioner. My wife is 50 years of age. I have made contributions for some 44 years to ensure a state pension and a widows pension, some 20 years contributions made on a 'voluntary basis' as I worked abroad after leaving the regular army. I paid voluntary contributions to ensure state and widows pensions in preference to a private pension scheme and I now learn that the Government is going to renege on this pensions contract with my wife and I."</p></blockquote>
Once the Bill becomes an Act, the widow will receive an extra £1,000. That is equivalent to slightly less than 12 weeks' widows pension, but it will be payable for only six months. As that gentleman rightly infers, assuming that the lady is made a widow at 55, there will be a shortfall of some £20,500. It is little wonder that he says,
	<br><blockquote><p>"What a situation after 44 years of contributions!"</p></blockquote>
There is someone who was in a position to take out private pension provision for 20 years to ensure that his wife received a higher benefit, but preferred to put his money into the state scheme. Perhaps the state scheme was cheaper—I cannot know what his motivation was—but I suspect that he thought that the state scheme was safer. What can be safer than a pension provided and guaranteed by Her Majesty's Government? One should, after all, be able to place one's trust in the British Government. If they enter into a contract with another party, it is reasonable for that party to say that, historically, the British Government keep their word. That is part of the national character and one of the reasons why people want to trade with us. If the British Government say that they want to do something—especially if it relates to an individual—they follow it through. Someone may have made 20 year's worth of contributions, which Chancellors of the Exchequer in various guises have put in the Treasury pocket—we know from previous interventions that the Chancellor keeps it on his back. Those contributions have been torn up in the face of the people who made them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kali Mountford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point. I wonder whether he made the same point when the previous Government removed the right of unemployed people to occupational pensions, which were taken account of in unemployment benefit. When the previous Government thereby changed the contract with people who received unemployment benefit, did he advance the same argument?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Gentleman goes down that route, I want to remind hon. Members to keep to the narrow point of voluntary contributions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to do so but I think that it is in order for me to say that the hon. Lady must realise that this is not a debating point; it is a matter of people's real anxieties. People who make contributions to their pension assume that they will be safe. To say, "You did it, therefore it is okay" or "Everything you did was wrong, therefore we will do it" is a redundant argument.

You are a highly cultured man, Mr. McWilliam, and I am sure that you will be aware that this is the 60th anniversary of the publication of "1984", which explored the nature of the state. Labour Members are engaging in double-speak, which is exactly what Eric Blair or George Orwell warned us about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is only in order if he is speaking about voluntary contributions to the Ministery of Truth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a good ruling. It reminds me of the final page of "Animal Farm", which describes the animals looking on and not being able to tell the pigs from the people. The argument that says, "The Tories did it, so we will do it", is redundant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are considering a simple probing amendment, which asks what will happen to the money. Will it be ignored, will people receive a refund or will an exception be made? I will be amazed if the wording of my amendment covers the exact point. It is important to obtain a definitive view from the Government on voluntary contributions. In that spirit of probing, I look forward to the Minister's response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is labouring under a misapprehension and I am not sure why. The letter that he read out sounded to me as if it were complaining about the changes made by the Social Security Act 1986, which related to SERPS. We will no doubt return to that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall explain the contribution conditions for the new bereavement benefits, which exactly mirror those of the benefits that they replace. For the widowed parents allowance and the bereavement allowance, the late spouse must satisfy two conditions. First, he or she must have paid contributions for one whole tax year. Secondly, to obtain 100 per cent. of the basic rate benefit, he or she must have had qualifying years for about 90 per cent. of his or her working life. A qualifying year is one in which contributions are paid or credits awarded. If he or she has had fewer qualifying years than required, the allowance or pension will be reduced accordingly, in the normal way for retirement pensions. No pension will be payable if the number of qualifying years is less than a quarter of the number needed for a full payment. For the bereavement payment, the conditions are different. The late spouse must have paid the equivalent of six months' worth of contributions at the minimum level in any one year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
3.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those arrangements are no different from those that apply to the current widows benefit scheme. We are simply carrying them over to the new bereavement benefits. As far as voluntary, or class 3, contributions are concerned—they are the subject of the amendment—it is already possible for them to count as paid contributions. A person may therefore improve his or her contribution record by paying class 3 contributions to protect his or her right to a basic retirement pension or bereavement benefit for a spouse. That may be where there is no liability to pay contributions in a tax year, or where the contributions paid or credited are not enough to enable
	<span class='label label-info column'>508</span>
that tax year to be taken into account for pension purposes. Those voluntary contributions may be paid up to six years after the relevant year or, in exceptional cases, later than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can therefore assure the hon. Gentleman that voluntary contributions will count for bereavement benefit purposes. They are not being changed by the clause. They will count either if the late spouse has paid voluntary contributions to protect the benefit rights of his or her partner, or if the partner seeks to make up the record to gain benefit rights.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to clarify one point for the Minister's benefit. The heading of the letter is "Proposed change to widow's pension." The writer of the letter points out that at the age of 55 she will only be entitled to a full widows pension for six months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, this is a probing amendment. It has wider implications than for just this clause, but this seemed to be the best place to put it to get an early discussion on the matter. If the gentleman in this case was before us, he would say that he had made his contributions so that his wife could receive a pension, not just for six months—because they do not have children of school age, or in further education—but up to retirement age. He is saying that he made voluntary contributions because he thought that the state would offer his wife a pension to take her up to her retirement pension, but it is not going to do so. The gentleman is saying that he feels cheated and that his contributions were accepted under false pretences. What would the Minister say to this chap, who has put in money for 20 years on the assumption that when he died, his wife would have a pension up to her retirement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are changing the arrangements for bereavement benefit, for the reasons that I have already given to the Committee. However, the position for voluntary contributions is no different from the position for those that are not voluntary. The hon. Gentleman asks what I would say to that person. I would say precisely what I would say to everyone affected by these changes, which are necessary for modernising the system. The voluntary contributions made by the writer of that letter will be treated in exactly the same way as the contributions made by everyone else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The question is whether there is a good reason for being more generous to those who have been married, or should we be equally generous to the bereaved person whether he or she was married or lived in a partnership arrangement, but was not formally married under British law? The case has been made that when two people are living as if they are married, they should not gain more benefits than those who are formally married. For example, for housing benefit, people are treated as if they were married even if they are not formally married. If housing benefits are granted on that basis, it is also fair that other benefits from which they may gain should be granted to them, whether or not they are formally married. One should ask whether the costs of bereavement, such as the funeral arrangements and taking over a partner's debt, are equal whether or not someone is married. Equally, you can ask whether the trauma is any less because you—I am sorry, Mr. McWilliam—because one has not gone through a marriage arrangement.

Child Poverty Action Group figures show that 37 per cent. of children are born out of wedlock, to use the time-honoured phrase. Children of partnership arrangements when the couple is not formally married have rights. The hon. Member for Colne Valley is keen to look after the children in our society properly and to target benefits on them. According to her argument, it is important that the children of parents who are not formally married should not suffer just because of the action—or lack of it—of their parents before one of them died. If the amendments to equalise the treatment between couples are not accepted, it would penalise the children of an informal arrangement, whereas the children of a formally married couple would gain. That is contrary to the argument of the hon. Member for Colne Valley a short time ago about the importance of targeting benefits on children and ensuring that they are properly looked after.

He delivered his argument for equality with great gusto.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me put two thoughts to the hon. Gentleman. There is an old saw that the way to hell is paved with good intentions. When framing legislation, it is easy to produce hard cases, but on the issue of comparability between marriage and living together in circumstances that appear to be like marriage, but which do not involve the commitment of marriage, we must consider not only how it will affect existing couples, but the impact that it will have on incentives for the wider population.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We must consider the effect of the payment or not of bereavement benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, Mr. McWilliam. In each of the proposals, including this one about equality between married and unmarried couples, it could be argued that the particular incentive of this measure is not particularly strong either way. The fact that there is overwhelming evidence that married couples are much more likely to stay together and the certain benefits to the taxpayer and society are brushed to one side in calling on individual hard cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rendel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, this argument will run and run. The hon. Gentleman is making the classic mistake in thinking that just because those who are married stay together more than those who are not, the one is the cause of the other. Is not it equally likely that couples stay together because their relationship is good, or because they are the sort of people who are more likely to get married? Those who are likely to break up more frequently are the ones who are less likely to get married. It is not the act of marrying that causes couples to stay together.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In the old days, across a range of Government measures, there were substantial fiscal incentives for couples to marry and remain married. That is no longer the case. Plato said that for a wall, one needed small pebbles as well as large stones. This measure is one such example of a small pebble.

The premise from which the amendment is drawn must be that in the cases to which the amendment refers, there must be a degree of commitment, otherwise we would be paying allowances all over the place. Could the next-door neighbour be considered on that basis? People must have been living together for a sufficient period to establish a quasi-married status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should resist the amendment. We should consider carefully whether to include people who have chosen not to get married.

Marriage amounts to making a public act of commitment in a registery office, a church, a mosque or a synagogue before two witnesses—I think that that is the legal requirement—and a registrar or a clergyman who has registrar equivalence. The evidence is overwhelming that people who participate in that act are much more likely to spend a long time together, if not their whole lives. The more that we pass laws that detract from the special status that marriage offers, the more we shall find that relationships become shorter and shorter, and children are the first to lose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not only dealing with children; the taxpayer has a second distinct interest in couples—if a couple stays together there is a much greater chance of one party ending up as the carer of the other. That is much bigger than just a financial matter, but there is a financial aspect to it.

Marriages play an important part in our society. It is marriages that constitute by far the most important form of welfare provision, not the Department of Social Security. That is why I urge the Government to resist the amendment and, at least in this matter, keep the distinction between married couples and unmarried couples allegedly living in a quasi-marital relationship.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Social Security Mr. Hugh Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a shame to have to interfere in a private argument between good friends. Clearly, the hon. Members for Newbury and for Canterbury are passionate about the causes that they espouse, although they have diametrically opposed points of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are all about marital status. Under amendment No. 210, entitlement to bereavement benefits would be extended to cohabiting couples. We intend to continue to base entitlement to bereavement benefits only on legal marriage between couples at the time of death. We believe that that is right for two primary reasons. First, marriage is a cornerstone of the contributory benefits systems. Marriage carries with it special responsibilities. The state recognises that fact and bereavement benefits reflect that recognition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, marriage provides a straightforward method of deciding whether benefits should he paid. It would be far more difficult to administer and police the benefits if they were extended to unmarried couples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, our intention is to provide new support on bereavement as directly and simply as possible. We shall extend contributory benefits to widowers for the first time. As with widows benefit, entitlement to the new benefits will be based on legal marriage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newbury called for equal treatment for children of married and unmarried parents. However, bereavement benefits deal with the costs arising from the death of a spouse and other benefits provide for the care of children. The Government have an unparalled record on providing support for families. This year, we introduced the highest ever increase in child benefit, a new child tax credit and a higher than inflation increase in income-related benefits for children under the age of 11. We have improved the provision available for children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oaten</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could not children born out of wedlock have to take on the burden of some of the funeral expenses in a way that would not happen if the Government were to accept the amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. Clearly the hon. Gentleman means a family with children born out of wedlock would have to take on the responsibility for the funeral expenses. If they meet the criteria, a social fund payment would be available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rendel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that the social fund payments for funeral expenses are much less than the £2,000 bereavement benefit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, but the hon. Gentleman must look at the benefits system as a whole. He must recognise the fact that the bereavement payment is intended to deal with the costs incurred when a husband

	<span class='label label-info column'>513</span>
or wife faces the death of his or her spouse. A separate part of the benefits systems deals with the proper support of children in families of different sorts-those with married parents, unmarried parents or single parents. I stand proudly on the Government's record; we have substantially increased in real terms the amount of money available to support children in families of all kinds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would result in increased complexity and intrusive questioning about the nature of a claimant's relationship with the deceased at what is clearly a difficult and sensitive time. From my short experience of being a junior Social Security Minister, I know that one of the hardest jobs that Benefits Agency staff have to do is to talk to recently bereaved people about the necessary changes in their benefit status. It would be wrong to introduce a system in which difficult and intrusive questions had to be asked about the nature of a relationship between two people shortly after one of them had died.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, conflicting claims could be a problem—for example, people who have separated from their spouses but not divorced them might die, leaving both a surviving unmarried partner and a legal spouse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members may be aware that commentators have suggested various ways of determining entitlement for unmarried couples—for example, prescribing a fair length of time for a couple to have lived together or maintaining records of nominated partners on behalf of national insurance contributors. Those would involve the Benefits Agency in more complicated administrative arrangements. Claims would be more difficult to decide and there would be increased scope for fraud. All that would slow down the process and make it more difficult to meet our stated aim of providing benefit when it is most needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the current arrangements should remain in place, providing security to married couples. Unmarried couples will continue to be covered by alternative state benefits, including help with funeral costs from the social fund. Couples can also provide security for their families by way of private pension or life assurance arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 209 would allow a bereavement payment to be made if the surviving spouse is cohabiting with someone to whom the person is not married at the time of the spouse's death. Amendment No. 211 would make widowed mothers allowance and widows benefit payable if the woman is cohabiting, at any time, with a man she is not married to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we have made clear, the whole point of bereavement benefit is to provide financial support for the surviving spouse in the period immediately following bereavement. The circumstances of a bereaved person living with the spouse when that spouse dies are different from those of someone living with a new partner. A widow or widower who is cohabiting may well be receiving financial support from a current partner. In those circumstances, it would be difficult to justify paying a non-means-tested benefit which is intended to cushion the loss of income on the death of a spouse. It would be unfair to treat those widows and widowers who
	<span class='label label-info column'>514</span>
cohabit differently from other unmarried men and women in that position. For those who do cohabit, alternative benefits are available—for example, assistance from income-related benefits based on the financial needs of the family or from contributory benefits based on a person's own contributions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Mr. McWilliam. Will the Minister read his text a little more slowly, because some of us are becoming confused about this complicated matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to go through the rigmarole of reading the whole paragraph again and you would call me out of order for repetition, Mr. McWilliam, if I did. It will be available on the record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I simply make the point that a range of social security benefits is available to meet the needs of unmarried couples who face bereavement. For those who cohabit, alternative benefits are available—for example, assistance from income-related benefits based on the financial needs of the family or from contributory benefits based on a person's own contributions. I urge the Committee to reject the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Government are resisting the amendments. A further important point lies at the root of our opposition in principle to abolishing the widows pension. It is wrong to play around with the insurance principle. The position on national insurance benefits for couples who are married or not married is clear. To keep making changes such as that in the clause is not justified on grounds of fairness. Unmarried couples have always known that they would not be entitled to widows benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Also relevant is the sort of behaviour that is encouraged. The state, on behalf of taxpayers, is entitled to use fiscal policies and to lay down principles for national insurance that encourage an institution such as marriage when it believes that that is desirable in the round for bringing up children, saving costs if people look after each other when they are old and so on. It is another nail in the coffin to turn round and say, "It doesn't matter. You don't have to be married for this category of understood national insurance benefit." The complications and difficulties that are involved in determining whether people have genuinely been long-term cohabiting couples are of practical significance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is particularly significant in this case. The hon. Member for Newbury drew a false analogy. He said that couples who live together as man and wife should be treated as a married couple. He was referring to benefits that are paid over long periods. We are discussing a one-off payment that would be paid to someone whose circumstances would be difficult to investigate, as the Minister said. To involve a huge amount of administrative complexity for one modest payment would be a disproportionate cost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>515</span>
The two most important issues are, first, that it is justified for the state to have policies to encourage marriage and, secondly, it is not right to play around with national insurance benefits. Citizens see national insurance as a form of insurance, just like any other. The Government should not fiddle with it or redefine it any more than is necessary. Citizens do not like it. They want to know where they stand on issues that may, or may not, be in their interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I substantially agree with the Minister—it is nice to be able to say that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newbury, whom I have known since he entered the House, has always struck me as a deeply compassionate man. It is not surprising that he has tabled the amendments. I know several people who experienced grief when someone died. Grief was not restricted to the spouse. However, successive Governments and, I think, the public have taken the view that monetary compensation to allow someone to get over bereavement and start a new life should be restricted to married couples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was not entirely clear—I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will put me right—whether he intends to restrict his proposal to unmarried couples in mixed-sex relationships, or to extend it to single-sex relationships. I am thinking in particular of amendment No. 210 which refers to "husband, wife and spouse". Grief is not restricted to someone who is part of a mixed-sex relationship outside marriage. Someone whose same-sex partner dies after a long relationship will also feel great grief on bereavement. That person will feel many of the characteristics that we have described—loneliness, the need to come to terms with the death and a desire to hide away. We must recognise that there is an injustice if the state does not provide some assistance for those people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the state does not offer compensation on the basis of measuring grief; it offers compensation to those who are married. People who marry are part of a formal contract that is made before the civil authorities or God. That act is a statement that their relationship is one of mutual support. It is in the interests of the state to encourage that institution of mutual support. That is why the Under-Secretary is right to resist the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary made an especially important point regarding enforcement and protection of the civil purse. A labyrinth of checks and counterchecks would be necessary to ensure that claims were legitimate and that the money went to the right people. One can think of all kinds of abuses and arrangements that could be entered into by elderly people, in conjunction with unscrupulous people, to ensure that a small nest egg was left to someone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I helped an aunt to fill in the necessary forms in order to lighten her burden—it is always very helpful if one can lighten the administrative burden of someone for whom one cares deeply—so I have been through the process of making a claim and I know that the process is efficient. The system is designed to consider whether there was a marriage, so they look at the marriage certificate, then to consider when death took place, so they look at the death
	<span class='label label-info column'>516</span>
certificate, and that is about it. I would not say that it was a painless process—sometimes we get administrative matters right and sometimes we get them wrong—but the initial process of proving a death is relatively quick.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That could not be the case if the person was part of a relationship—albeit a long and loving relationship—that did not have the benefit of marriage. Then it would not be merely a matter of producing the marriage certificate, but of producing gas bills, perhaps photos of past holidays, and all sorts of strange proof, which must be an extremely difficult thing to do at a time of bereavement. For all those reasons, the Government are right to resist the amendment. I accept that the hon. Member for Newbury is acting out of compassion, but it is a wrong-headed compassion because it does not consider the interests of the family or the state, so I urge my hon. Friends to vote against the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rendel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an interesting debate because it has demonstrated the significant differences between the Liberal Democrats and the two other parties. Clearly, we do not believe in prescribing one way in which everyone should live. We are much more free about trying to give people the option to live according to their own choices and volition. That is a fundamental difference between the Liberal Democrats and the other two parties, and one of the reasons why I would never want to join either of them or support their policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, whether one supports the amendment comes down to a straight choice between whether one feels that the Bill should provide a real incentive to marry and encourage the formal act of marriage, or whether one feels that there is no incentive or one does not even wish to encourage the formal act of marriage. I should be a little hurt, were I to find out—I hope that I never shall—that my wife's main intention in marrying me was that she found the incentive of a bereavement payment at some point in the future to be attractive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The solution to the mystery.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rendel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. Perhaps that is the solution to the mystery of why anyone would have ever thought of marrying me. That would be slightly hurtful. I have no doubt that you might feel the same about your wife, were you to discover that she had married—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I certainly would not encourage her to smother me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rendel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to hear that, Mr. McWilliam. For your sake, I hope that she will not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems slightly odd to argue that that is a reason why anyone might choose to marry—because of a financial incentive in the far distant future, in the form of a bereavement allowance or marriage allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar, it was not our original intention for the amendment necessarily to apply to couples of the same sex. Amendment No. 210 makes it clear that we are referring to men and women who live together as married couples. Nevertheless, he made a fair point when he said
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0755">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>517</span>
that, if couples in general are to be entitled to bereavement allowances, single-sex couples should be treated in the same way as those who live together as husband and wife.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Jacqui Lait 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beckenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rendel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to answer that question. The important point is who will incur the extra costs when a person dies. We should concern ourselves with the couple who are living together as a married couple, not with those who may have been married to one or other of the partners in question. As we have consistently argued, the important point is that the benefits are intended to meet the extra costs of the person who has been bereaved. That will not apply where a marriage has broken up, whether through divorce or because the couple have separated and started to live with other people. They will not have to meet those extra costs, which will fall on the couple who are living together at the time of bereavement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman realise that he makes the same point that the Under-Secretary of State makes? The Department would be visited by a grieving lady in widow's robes who will produce a death certificate and a marriage certificate, and by a second lady in widow's robes who will protest, "But he was living with me when he died!" The Department would have to set up a system to decide who was telling the truth and was more deserving, and a corresponding appeal system. The money that the Government have set aside would therefore be spent on administration and appeals.

The extension of his amendment, which he described in answer to the question on single-sex couples, would incur further additional cost. Has he discussed those costs with the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce), who is the Liberal Democrat spokesman on Treasury matters? We can all think of people to whom we would like to give more money, but there has to be some form of financial framework. Has his party's Treasury spokesman given him the authority to table his amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>518</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rendel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to say that we have discussed that question with our Treasury team. We found that the Government are cutting benefits to widows overall by a considerable sum. We are seeking not to increase the Government's overall spending but to ensure that the money that was previously—and fairly—allocated to widows and bereaved people will not be cut. It is reasonable to pay such sums to bereaved people. As long as those payments remain, we would be happy to share the sums in slightly different ways among the people concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to hear that the hon. Gentleman is at one with the hon. Member for Gordon. He said that the proposal was within his party's costings and, earlier, he said that there was a good case for extending the proposal to same-sex relationships. Has the hon. Member for Gordon given him the authority to make that additional commitment? If so, has he a rough idea of how much it would cost?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rendel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first time that we heard of the £100 million figure was when the Minister of State quoted it just now. I asked him what the relevant figures would be, but he has not answered me. Therefore, I cannot identify the precise sum that the amendment would involve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The overall sums that our amendments would require come within the overall total. One of the biggest questions involves how long the bereavement allowance should last. We have tabled various amendments that would ensure that the sums will tally. Sadly, however, by the time that we reach the amendment relating to the bereavement allowance, the Government may have rejected many other Liberal Democrat amendments. That would mean that a little more money would be available to increase the length of time for which the bereavement allowance could apply. It all depends on how many of the wonderful Liberal Democrat amendments the Government choose to accept. The more amendments that they accept, the lower will be the amount by which we could increase the bereavement allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary presented various arguments to which I want to reply. He presented the same fallacious argument that was given on amendment No. 102. He said that other benefits were available to the people concerned—in this case, the children of those who were not married at the time of bereavement—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kali Mountford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has just argued that there would be no overall increase in the Budget. The Government have increased benefits overall to those whose needs are greatest. Would not those benefits have to be cut to keep within the relevant limit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rendel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have always said that the right limit should be allocated to bereavement benefits in total, which should not be cut. In our response to this year's Budget, we made it clear that we do not accept some of the Government's tax cuts. More money is therefore available to us than is available to the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar, who is apparently prepared to accept the Chancellor's proposal, for example, to cut income tax next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0756">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>519</span>
The Under-Secretary committed the same fallacy that was committed for amendment No. 102. He introduced the subject of other benefits that are available—in this case, for children. Such benefits are available for all children: those who are not bereaved, whose parents stay together and who are still alive at the end any given year; those whose parents are married and one of whom dies; and those whose parents are unmarried and one of whom dies. Those benefits are intended to meet the significant costs of all children, regardless of their circumstances. It is wrong for some of those benefits suddenly to have to be allocated to cover bereavement costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government said that none of the extra benefits that they will provide for children should go towards the bereavement costs of a child with married parents, one of whom is suddenly bereaved. However, the Minister is apparently arguing that some of the extra benefits that will be allocated for children should go towards the bereavement costs of a child with unmarried parents, one of whom dies suddenly. That argument and the argument that the Minister of State used about cold weather payments—he said that they would enable old people to bear bereavement costs more easily—are similarly illogical. He also mentioned the fact that there might be greater scope for fraud and that people might have to face greater questioning if the amendment were accepted. He said that it might be difficult to decide to whom the relevant benefit should be paid and that cases might be slowed down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggested to the Under-Secretary that in most cases—especially those of married people—it would be abundantly clear what was happening and there would be no need to slow the case down. Only those extra cases that we want included—those of unmarried people—might necessitate a degree of extra questioning that might make the process more difficult. As the amendment would not create any increased difficulty in those cases in which the hon. Gentleman is interested, such an argument is no reason to reject the amendment. It simply introduces other couples for whom making decisions may be somewhat more difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, if someone was married 20 years earlier, to somebody who left to live for the next 20 years with somebody else, should that person, who was technically married for one year and is still technically married, be able to walk into the nearest benefits office and claim a bereavement allowance or widowed parents allowance? Such a person is not, in practice, married to the person who has just died and does not face any bereavement costs. The reasons for introducing these benefits do not apply to such a person. The suggestion that no questions should be asked once the marriage licence and the death certificate have been presented seems tantamount to accepting fraud. I am horrified that the Labour and Conservative parties should accept such a situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I admire the hon. Gentleman enormously, but that is absolutely potty.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the person concerned has not been living with his or her spouse for a long period, and none of the costs have been shared, the costs of bereavement will not be borne by the person who claims the bereavement allowance, because that person has not had anything to do with his or her deceased spouse for the whole of that period. If the hon. Gentleman believes that that is how the benefits system should be managed, he is suggesting that large amounts of benefits should go to those who do not need them and who have no moral justification for receiving them. It is a pity to set up a benefit system that gives benefits without moral justification or practical reason. I am horrified that the Conservatives should support such a system. I hope that they will withdraw their support. As I have said, it sounds remarkably like the acceptance of fraud in the benefit system and I am sorry to hear them supporting that.

	<span class='label label-info column'>521</span>
together, that is analogous to an oral contract. As I understand British law, oral contracts are just as liable to be upheld as written contracts. Therefore, we should apply the same rules to people who are informally married—who are living as though married, but without going through a formal marriage ceremony—as to those who are formally married. I should therefore like to press the amendment to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am tempted to say a few brief words. We should pay tribute to the hon. member for Newbury for tabling the amendment, because it has raised some interesting points. On his final point, I think that it was the late Hollywood producer, Sam Goldwyn, who said,
	<br><blockquote><p>"A verbal contract isn't worth the paper it is written on."</p></blockquote>
We need to look at what the hon. Gentleman was saying, because the points that he was making about marriage were becoming more and more ridiculous. The state has a vested interest in securing the institution of marriage. In terms of offering assistance to those who are bereaved, marriage must be the test. If we move beyond marriage, we shall ask the state—for all the reasons that the hon. Gentleman mentioned fraud and multiplicity of claims—to set up a system to make a judgment on the nature of a relationship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said, reasonably, that his amendment could apply to same-sex relationships. We could then have the absurd situation of a legally binding marriage that had not been terminated being judged against a same-sex relationship. The question of bringing children to the marriage was also mentioned, as was bringing companionship to the marriage, and it was suggested that those should also be a basis for qualification. I do not believe that the Government or any responsible political party would want to move in that direction. The Government is right to resist the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rendel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments relate to men who have made claims because they felt that they should have received the same benefits, such as bereavement allowances, as women receive. As we know, a number of men have tried to make such claims and have gone to the Benefits Agency to be told that they are ineligible. That is a clear case of sex discrimination, which is illegal under European law. That law is thought to be one of the reasons why the Government have introduced changes to to include widowers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 203 refers to claims for bereavement payments, amendment No. 204 refers to payments for widowed parents allowances and amendment No. 191 refers to payments for bereavement allowances. In all cases, the principle of the amendment covers the people
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0758">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>523</span>
who have either claimed, sought to claim, or said that they would have claimed, had they been eligible to do so, or who have applied to the European Court of Human Rights to see whether their claim was valid under European law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that the Government are changing the law to allow for widowers to receive payments as well as widows, it is fair that those payments should be backdated to the date of their claim. The CPAG has cited a precedent for such back-payments under European law, when new rights were agreed in the European Court on the invalid care allowance, which was introduced in 1988. Therefore, there is a precedent for doing what should be done and the amendments would do it. I hope that the Government will see fit to accept the amendments and incorporate them in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the general election, I raised the case of two of my constituents, both of them men, who were sadly bereaved and left to bring up young children. At that time, I argued for a change in the law. It is a historic day that Parliament is changing it now and that we are here in Committee seeing justice done for men.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In preparation for today's debate, I read some of the speeches of Emmeline Pankhurst, who accused Parliament of being a place where men made laws for women. Most of them were laws that discriminated against women. Under 19th century laws, a mother was not legally the parent of her child—only the father was the parent. Women were denied inheritance rights, the right to vote, and so on. One of those provisions made in the House by men for women, which we look back on in an old-fashioned, or even slightly patronising way, was benefits for widows—made, as the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford said, back in the 1930s.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 1925.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I stand corrected. We have an opportunity today in a rather different Parliament, with far more women Members than ever before, for women to make laws for men. I am delighted to see the difference. If I may plagiarise, today is a vindication of the rights of men. I thank the women members of the Committee for their support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These amendments are intended to allow payment of the new bereavement benefits to be backdated for men who were widowed before the appointed day. They would be paid the benefit, whether it be the lump sum bereavement payment, the time—limited bereavement allowance or the on-going widowed parents allowance for periods long before these benefits existed. Our reform of bereavement benefits is intended to modemise the system. The current system is both unfair and outdated. It does not reflect today's society with 70 per cent. of married women now working, and it openly discriminates against married men. We agree that widowers have been poorly treated by the system in the past, and we want to change that for the future. However, we do not believe that it would be sensible to backdate the new bereavement benefits for men who were widowed before the appointed day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>524</span>
It may help the Committee to understand our position if I briefly explain the purpose of the new bereavement benefits. The bereavement payment, which will replace the current widows payment, will provide immediate help with unexpected expenses arising on bereavement. We recognise the great importance of having swift, non-means-tested help at such a time. That is why we have doubled the value of the payment, from £1,000 to £2,000. We believe that this focuses state help where and when it is needed most.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new bereavement allowance will help both widows and widowers without dependent children. It is a time-limited benefit, which will help them to get back on their feet following the death of their husband or wife.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of both these benefits is to provide help in the period immediately following bereavement. For men who were widowed before the appointed day, those immediate needs will have long since passed. Backdating their entitlement would not focus help where it is needed most, and would not be a sensible use of public funds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would help if the Minister could tell us the cost of the Liberal Democrat amendment if he has the figures to hand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I have the figures, but perhaps I can raise the matter later in my speech. First, I should like to talk about the widowed parents allowance that will be available to men who were widowed before the appointed day. We have always made it clear that that is our intention. This benefit is aimed at both widows and widowers with dependent children. Widowed men with families need on-going support, and it is only right that they should get equal help. However, we do not intend to backdate their entitlement. Our priority is still to direct most help to those who need it most. Backdating entitlement to widowed parents allowance would not achieve that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that hon. Members are seeking to restrict entitlement to those widowers who have either made a claim, or say that they would have made a claim for the existing benefits. To have done so, they would have had to indicate to the Benefits Agency that they wish to claim, or to have made applications to the European Court of Human Rights. However, it would not be fair to single out that small minority for special help, simply because they tried to claim a benefit to which they were not entitled. We could not justify providing extra help to that group, without extending it to all current or past widowers who may have qualified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that it would be an administrative nightmare if people were to indicate that they had claimed from the Benefits Agency? The difficulty of proving that claim would be extraordinarily expensive and very complex.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Lady that the proposal would be difficult and complicated to implement. It would also be unfair, because a choice would have to be made between giving benefit in some cases and not giving it in others, even though the circumstances were the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0759">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>525</span>
As the hon. Lady rightly said, it would involve going back over cases for many years, which would be an expensive task. There would be massive implications for the programme expenditure. We estimate that it would cost in excess of £1 billion to implement a fair system of backdating the claims for widowers. No prudent Government would allow resources to be used in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our proposals will benefit widowed men in the future. Some 15,000 widowers a year will gain the lump sum bereavement payment of £2,000, and approximately 25,000 widowers will gain the widowed parents allowance in the first full year. Our reforms establish equality between women and men and focus help from the state on those who need it most, widowed parents—mothers and fathers caring for dependent children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that £1 billion the total cost of the benefits and other sums that would have to be paid? Does that figure include the administrative costs of setting up such a system? Has the Under-Secretary estimated how much that would cost?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The £1 billion figure is the cost of backdating the benefit to widowed men in all cases. For the reasons that I explained, it would not be possible to discriminate between those who say that they had claimed the benefit and other people. Such payments would have to be backdated in all cases or in none. If they were to be backdated in all cases, the cost would be in excess of £1 billion. Clearly, no Government could prudently commit themselves to spending such a large sum in that way. I do not have a figure for the administrative costs, but they would be substantial.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Under-Secretary agree that £1 billion is roughly equivalent to half the penny on income tax that Liberal Democrat Members keep saying that they would spend?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is exactly equivalent to one half of the penny that the Liberal Democrats have pledged to education, but since then they have said that they would spend it on health and many other things. Under just one amendment, they would spend half of the 1p increase in income tax that they pledge to make. They are spending a miraculous penny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our reforms will establish equality between men and women and focus help on those who need it most: widowed parents, both fathers and mothers, who care for dependent children. Our reforms will provide increased support when it is needed most—immediately after bereavement. The amendments fail both tests and I urge the Committee to reject them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rendel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the short time available—I understand that you intend to adjourn the Committee shortly, Mr. McWilliam—may I say that it was not our intention in tabling the amendments that all back-payments should be made to all those who might at some time in the past have been eligible if the law had then been as it will be. On the contrary, we intended that back payments should go only to that, I suspect, rather small group of people who could show—no doubt, using written evidence, rather than by just saying so—that they had tried to claim
	<span class='label label-info column'>526</span>
such benefits and that they were disappointed to find that they were available only for women. That would cost much less than £1 billion. Perhaps the Under-Secretary will tell us why the amendments do not mean what we intended them to mean. He has not yet done so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is fair to say that the Under-Secretary said that such benefits were not due to those people. I understand that the ruling of the European Court of Human Rights has shown that those people were due those sums in the past. The fact that they were not given them was illegal according to the court. Therefore, those people would not suddenly be given payments that were not due to them. In fact, they were due those payments all along.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Under-Secretary will accept that we wanted to make the system fair to all those who made claims, whereas it was unfair previously. However, the hon. Gentleman apparently has reason to believe—I hope that he will tell me what it is later—that the amendments might not be written in exactly the right format to do what we want them to do. He claims that our proposals would cost much more than we expected, given the small number of people to whom we thought they would apply. Although we might return to such matters later, I am happy to beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It is a probing amendment—we do not feel strongly about a particular date. We want to give husbands sufficient time
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0760">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>527</span>
to put their financial affairs in order to provide for their wives—their wife—[	<i>Laughter.</i>] I was thinking of the Liberal Democrat's former amendment and imagining a harem competing for the benefit. We want husbands to be able to ensure that their wives are properly taken care of.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such changes have been made in the past and it is important for people to be given time to put their affairs in order. It is not as easy to make those arrangements when people come closer to the statutory age of retirement as when they are in their 20s. The issue is the speed with which the provision is being introduced and I should be grateful if the Minister would clarify that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The date in the amendment may not be appropriate and 2003, 2004 or 2010 might be better. I am not sure what it should be, but the Bill is in danger of being unjust, particularly to women, unless consideration is given to when the provision is introduced. This is a sexist provision because it relates only to husbands putting their affairs in order to care for their wives. Why should not wives be given time to put their affairs in order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Lait</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because women are organised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham, in her traditional harrying way with which she ensures that I make progress, says that women are organised. But for the past 30 or 40 years women have not been making contributions on the assumption that their husbands would receive a pension and various benefits in the event of their demise. There is less need for women to put their affairs in order because there will be a degree of certainty about the various new payments. Husbands have made that assumption and I have read out various letters and cited various cases. I do not want to be repetitious and I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister has told me that he wants to raise another matter on a point of order and it may be convenient if he does so now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. I remind the Committee that before we suspended, the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar asked what the administrative cost would be of backdating bereavement benefits to all widowers. I must tell the hon. Member for Newbury that I recognise that that was not the intention of the Liberal Democrat amendment, but the administrative cost would be at least £2 million. I was wrong when I said that my officials had not produced an estimate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order for me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you Mr. McWilliam. I hope that you will not need to call me to order when I refer to the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 206, 207 and 208 would allow women who are widowed after the new bereavement benefits are introduced to claim widowed mothers allowance or widows pension, as now, until 1 January 2020. The amendments would undermine the fundamental principle of the new bereavement benefits,
	<span class='label label-info column'>528</span>
which is to give both men and women equal access to those benefits, and to provide support where and when it is most needed in a direct and simple way. It might help the Committee if I explain why that is so and why the amendments should be resisted. I shall attempt to do so in a conciliatory way, as the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar kindly told the Committee that he tabled the amendment to provoke debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the amendments would maintain, for almost another two decades, inequality of treatment between men and women. Secondly, they would no nothing to ensure that benefit help was targeted on those in greatest need. The amendments would provide continuing support for widows up to pension age, regardless of their circumstances or income. We believe that bereavement benefits are needed most at the point of bereavement and by those with dependent children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the amendments would introduce considerable administrative complexity. They would create a system whereby a man and woman, widowed on the same day, could have access to different benefits for the same purpose, our reforms focus help from the state where and when it is most needed, while helping those who can support themselves to do so. We will spend £140 million more in the first year to meet real need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know where the hon. Member for Newbury thinks that he can find the savings to fund his amendment. Earlier this afternoon, several Conservative Members mocked the Liberal Democrats for the cost of their proposals. I must tell the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is coming close to provocation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is, but it will be put in a not so provocative, but more friendly and helpful way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cost of the hon. Gentleman's amendments in the first year would he a modest £10 million, but the costs would rise rapidly. By the third year, the amendments would cost the Exchequer £110 million, and by the year 2020–21—the end date under the amendments—they would cost £600 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be quite unfair and provocative to ask the hon. Gentleman whether he has consulted the right hon. Member for Horsham (Mr. Maude) about the cost, because we all know that the right hon. Member for Horsham regards the Labour party's spending proposals as reckless and extravagant, and I am sure that he would not want his party to be associated with proposals to increase costs by some £600 million a year. However, I do not want to be provocative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course we shall protect the position of women widowed before the appointed day, who will be able to continue to claim widows benefits under the rules in force at the time of their bereavement. They will also be able to continue to receive widowed mothers allowance or widows pension for as long as they satisfy the qualifying conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the concern of the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar that couples should be given enough time to make arrangements to reflect the changes in entitlement—for example, to take out private
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0761">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>529</span>
insurance cover or to plan a return to work. However, we are confident that we are giving people sufficient notice of the changes. We said that we will not commence a new scheme before April 2001. We are also introducing special rules for older widows and widowers who may find it harder to plan a return to work. Those who are aged 55 or over at the start of the new arrangements and who are widowed in the first five years will be able to claim income-related help without signing on for work. A special premium will help to ensure that their income will remain at the level of a six-month bereavement allowance. The amendments would maintain inequality of treatment between men and women.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This set of amendments, which you described as "wrecking" amendments, Mr. McWilliam, go to the heart of the worst feature of the Bill—the destruction of the principle of insurance and the introduction of a fresh means test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the contributory principle first. The year 2020 was chosen to allow people who will not have to face bereavement for a long time to have their contributions honoured. As my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar pointed out in another context, contributions are often made voluntarily. He was right about the contributory principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister made an extraordinary statement, the gist of which was that people who are under 55 should be able to make other arrangements because they have until 2001. A man may be worried about his wife. She may not have worked, done only a small amount of part-time work, which is more likely, or given up her original full-time work to take a long break to rear children. How comforting is it for him to know that the situation will change in two years' time and that his contributions, which he made over the years to benefit his widow, will be lost? He has only two years to make alternative provision. That is a tawdry way to treat people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I defend the contributory principle, I feel even more strongly about means-testing, which is the other strand of the argument. I was rightly upbraided by the Minister on a smaller point relating to capital sums when I had missed the drift of the argument. But the point that I made then is applicable with a vengeance to means-testing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the second half of the previous Government's time in office—1988 onwards—we mistakenly introduced measures that involved means-testing. I do not want to list those because that would take me outside the scope of the amendment and try your patience, Mr. McWilliam, but the point of principle that applied to those also applies here. We continually rewarded those who had not saved and punished those who had. All Committee members—except, perhaps, those who were part of the new intake—will have met constituents who say, "I feel that I'm being punished because I'm just above the income support threshold". In another context, I cited the evidence of the 500,000 pensioners who ditched their savings as a result of the changes made to the arrangements for pensioners in 1988.

Throughout the various arguments that ensued, the then Opposition said, "This is all completely wrong. The Government should not be doing this." They even retorted with some of our own language by saying that we were penalising thrift. In 1988, I was a new Member of Parliament and I have to say that, having voted in favour of the change, I came bitterly to regret doing so. I wrote no less than three papers, which the media covered quite generously, pointing out where we had gone wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Government, after fighting an election campaign that was dominated by their commitment to converting the welfare system to a hand up instead of a hand out system, have produced a legislative centrepiece that says to couples where the man is working and the wife is not, or is on a small income, "If you make small levels of alternative provision, tough—you're on your own after six months. On the other hand, if you don't bother, we'll support you." The very arguments that were well made during the last two Parliaments of the previous Government by the left wing of the Labour party, by independent-minded Conservatives like Sir Brandon Rhys-Williams, and by the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) and which were repeatedly proved right within a year or two of their being enacted, are being reintroduced and expanded by this Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not expect Labour Back Benchers to defend the measure—the new intake have their careers to think of. Nevertheless, when they campaigned on the slogan that the welfare state is supposed to provide a hand up, rather than a hand out, I doubt whether they imagined that they would be telling households that, in future, where a wife is widowed and people on small incomes have struggled to put together savings, pensions or alternative provisions, the Government will walk away from them after six months, but will continue to support people who do not make such provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall make one final point, on language. The previous Conservative Government got a number of things right on welfare, such as the fantastic growth in occupational pensions. However, we also made a number of mistakes and the magic word that appeared time and again in the speeches of those Ministers who defended the worst of those mistakes was "targeting". Reference was continually made to the targeting of people who most needed money. In cases where a capital means test or a means test with a sharp income taper had to be introduced, the system increased the number of traps, rather than helping people to get off benefit, and effectively rewarded those who failed to provide for themselves. I do not believe that that was the previous Government's intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 45 is at the heart of what is wrong with the Bill. I accept that there is a strong case for fixing a date of 2020 with regard to the contributory side of the argument, but the extent to which one should defer the provision on the meanstested side of the argument is completely arbitrary, because it is wrong wherever one brings it in. However, it would at least mean that future Governments could return to the matter without damage being inflicted on the system in the meantime.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I discuss the length of time that is reasonable, I want to explore a matter that the Under-Secretary raised. It will help us in our consideration of the amendment and later amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary said that those who currently claim the widow's benefit will not be affected. However, will those who receive the widowed parents allowance be eligible for the bereavement allowance when their children are no longer dependent? Does it all depend on whether the husband died before or after the Bill's enactment? As we approach 2001, when the Bill's provisions will come into force, will it be in a widow's interest to cease to claim the widowed parents allowance and to claim the widow's pension which will be paid under the old regime, because she was widowed before the Bill's enactment? That would enable her to receive a bereavement allowance for more than six months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not trying to trick the Under-Secretary. The question occurred to me while he was speaking. If he wants to think about it and to reply later, I should be happy for him to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Okay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My purpose in moving the amendments was not to get hung up on the 2020 date, but to establish what the Government thought was reasonable. They think that two years is reasonable notice, but I do not. I accept that 20 years might be unreasonable. The Government will have to rethink their approach.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. Would it be in order to say that, in view of the circumstances, I shall write to the hon. Gentleman on that matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I call the hon. Gentleman to move amendment No. 110.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 110, in page 40, line 39, after first "the", insert "surviving spouse or the".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments involve equality between men and women. We discussed feminism in a previous sitting. Under the Government's proposals, and with the new method of calculation, men will be at a distinct disadvantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I claim this argument as my own. I raised it during a statement by the Secretary of State for Social Security, who said that he intended to treat men and women equally. The statement pointed out that women's wages tend to be lower. However, in this context, a husband's contributions will be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have with me the statement of someone who has considerable expertise in this matter. It throws light on whether my argument is right. If you are, or have been, a Minister of State at the Department of Social Security, you will become an expert on such issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have never had that privilege.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a matter of regret. I sincerely hope that one day I will face you across the Committee Room, Mr. McWilliam—your lack of enthusiasm makes me even more grief-stricken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have the evidence of a noted expert on the matter before us—I refer to the morning sitting of this Committee on 23 March. At column 385, the Minister of State said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Of those seven out of 10 married women who are in work, a number are in part-time work."</p></blockquote>
Quite right. He continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is likely that they are not able to contribute to a decent funded pension, which they will need to have access to when they retire. It is important that pension sharing is available to them and that there is no arbitrary age cut-off below which it will not be available."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee D,</i> 23 March 1999; c. 385.]</p></blockquote>
What is true of pension sharing must be true with regard to contributions. The purpose of the amendments is to place men and women on an equal level—the highest contribution is used, whether it was made by the man or the woman. As time goes on, we all hope to see a gradual and significant rise in women's remuneration—as they rightly receive promotion and benefit from equality at work—and the need for the amendments will therefore disappear. The amendments merely take account of the current reality. A measure that purports to introduce equality should not be based on inequality. I want the Minister to tackle the foundation of inequality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must consider the situation of existing widows—has the Minister given any consideration to their plight? Will it be to their advantage to forgo the bereaved parents element in favour of the bereavement
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0763">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>533</span>
allowance? Would that be permissible? I have already asked the Under-Secretary a similar question, with which I should have persisted. How will a level playing field for contributions be established, given the inequality experienced by women? What will be done about existing widows?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman raised this question in a previous debate, and I promised to write to him, it may be convenient for the Committee if I give my response now. Existing widows in receipt of widowed mother's allowance will be able to receive widows pension if they are aged 45 or over when their youngest child ceases to be dependent. That is the current system and that protection will be continued. New widows and widowers in receipt of widowed parents allowance will not be able to receive bereavement allowance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is helpful. I thought that that was the case, but some of the briefing that Opposition Members will have received, which all hon. Members will have received, would tend to suggest otherwise and it is useful to get that on the record. I shall return to the material point to which the Minister will respond. It was a point that I made and I notice that it has subsequently been taken up in briefings from Age Concern and the Child Poverty Action Group. It is a fact that men and women will be treated on an unequal basis and I would like to know what the Minister proposes to do about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The benefits paid to a widow have always been based on the contributions of her deceased husband, so the principle that we are proposing for bereavement benefits is the one that has always applied to widows benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is also the approach taken with insurance. Someone pays into a scheme so that when they die, the scheme can provide a measure of support to their surviving spouse within the rules of that scheme. That is the well-established insurance principle on which these provisions are based.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman pointed out that many men could lose out because their wives would not have paid sufficient national insurance contributions. I accept that he has a point, but women's contributions are improving rapidly to match those of men, as the number of women in the work force continues to increase. In addition, women who are taking or have taken a break from work to care for someone—a young child or a disabled relative, for example—will not lose out, because their national insurance position is protected through home responsibilities protection. That can protect their pension rights, when they reach pension age, or their husband's entitlement to bereavement benefit. I do not think that the scale of the issue is as great as the hon. Gentleman might think, although I accept that he has made a worthwhile and important point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rendel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister raised an interesting point about insurance and about how a man will often insure against his own life to ensure that his widow is provided for when he dies and when his family loses his earnings as a consequence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>534</span>
Is it not also the case that some men are now insuring, out of their earnings, against their wife dying? Some men now accept that if their wife were to die, it would involve them and their families in extra costs and it is therefore worth using some of their earnings to insure against that possibility. Is it not therefore reasonable that the national insurance contributions that a man pays should in some way insure against his wife dying?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: National insurance contributions have never been made on that basis. There may be policies available that have that effect and, of course, premiums will be raised to an appropriate extent so that the policies can provide such cover. However, that is not and never has been the basis for the national insurance system. The change that the amendments propose would not be desirable, as we are introducing the reforms to focus help on those who need it most.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary made the important point, which had not been mentioned before, that we will spend £100 million extra in the first year after the proposals come into effect, because we think that the principle of extending provision to men is right. Although in the longer term there will be savings, in the short term there will be extra costs. I hope that, on that basis, hon. Members will accept that the balance in our proposals is right and will not choose to put the amendment to the vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rendel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment should be pursued and I hope that Conservative Members will choose to put it to the vote. The Liberal Democrats would like to support them if they do. It seems to me that we should be considering the right of the family unit as a whole. Some units will be based on the father always being the earner; some units will be based on the mother being the earner and the father being a house husband; and some will be based on them both earning and making national insurance contributions. It does not seem right that, in setting out the bereavement benefit system, the Government should assume that contributions are based on the person who has not died. It seems to be perfectly fair that the family should choose who is the main earner and who will make the greatest number of contributions. Then, after the earning spouse has died, the family's benefits should be based on the higher contributions record. That seems to be fair and reasonable so I will support the Conservative amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of clarification with the Minister, the appointed date is April 2001. It is clear that if someone is widowed, is over 45, has children and receives the widowed mother's allowance, that person's widow's pension, as was, is "grandfathered". If a woman is over 45 and has no children, the pension is not "grandfathered". Beyond the appointed day, if the person is over 55, it is possible to claim income support without having to comply with the jobseeker's requirements. There seems to be a gap in relation to women who are widowed and aged over 45 before April 2001, who neither receive the old widow's pension nor will they receive the enhanced future terms for people over 55. Therefore, the provisions are not only prejudiced against men, but against women in a particular narrow age group.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0764">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>535</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Uncharacteristically, the Minister has missed, the point. This is not about equality in the abstract, but about equality in the particular. The hon. Member for Newbury referred to a "unit"—just say "a family". The bereavement allowance will depend on whether the husband or wife dies. It will be the same family with the same loss, the same grief and the same bills, but it is a lottery because who dies will determine the amount of remuneration. That is completely illogical. I do not believe that that is the Minister's intention. The Chancellor made a clear and unambiguous statement to the effect that he wanted to place men and women on a level playing field. The Government cannot achieve that without the amendment, so I intend to press it to a vote, unless, even at this late stage, the Minister believes that we have a point and he wants to go away and think about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister rightly conceded in his speech that the situation is the result of an historic accident. For various historical reasons, someone might have entered the work force late or have received a poor deal—perhaps, as a consequence of "glass ceilings", of which there is still evidence today, and being paid less on promotion. As women rightly have full equality with regard to wage rates and remuneration, the problem will disappear and it will not cost the Government additional sums. The amendment is designed to deal with the inequality that many people have devoted their lives to stamping out. Some hon. Members, including my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham, have played more than a significant part in doing so during the past few years. The situation is an historic accident and a product of inequality. The Minister must recognise that. While we deal with inequality, which we want to wipe out, its residue should not be allowed to haunt us, as it will if the amendment is not accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can reassure the hon. Gentleman that there is no confusion among Labour Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) referred to an unidentified gap in provision. We are proposing to change the basis for payment of bereavement benefits along the lines that are set out in the consultation document and the Bill. That is clear. We have said that there is a particular issue for those who are widowed over the age of 55, which is why we have proposed a transitional arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar should ask himself whether he supports the contributory system. If he does—and, up to now, Conservative Members have affirmed their support for it, although one would find it difficult to reconcile the record of the previous Government with their position today—he must accept that benefits are paid on contributions that have been made. It is the late spouse's contributions that count. We are not proposing to change that. The records of men and women will become comparable. Fewer women—although not a great many fewer—have made the necessary contributions, but if we run with the contributory system, we must take the consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the contribution of the hon. Member for Newbury, it may be a little unfair to say that as soon as someone suggests that it might be a good idea to spend more money, he jumps to his feet and says, "That's a good idea. Let's do it." We are discussing £40 million in
	<span class='label label-info column'>536</span>
this instance. That takes us up to £200 million that he has advocated spending today, not counting the £1 billion that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary dealt with on the previous group of amendments. The hon. Gentleman's party needs to address where the money is to be found. It is easy for him to say that he wants to spend more money on this or that and find other groups to spend it on, but he has to work out how he would achieve that. Simply to talk about an extra penny on income tax, which I recall was to be for education, and vaguely talk about some spare money that he could contribute to worthy causes, is not good enough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rendel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the Minister recognise that because he is refusing all our suggestions, we have spent no money? Were he to accept our amendments, the sum would accumulate and become quite large, but so far, we have spent nothing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raises an interesting point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the Minister resumes, I must remind the Committee that we are dealing with amendment No. 110 and not the goodness knows how many amendments that we debated before it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It certainly would be interesting to know whether the hon. Member for Newbury thinks that this is the most important amendment and the one to which we should allocate extra cash. The Liberal Democrat party signally fails to make decisions and choices of priority. It would be more helpful if it did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister began by saying that I had a point. No one has disputed that my argument is factually accurate. What it comes down to is the rhetoric gap—it is about saying one thing and doing something less. The treatment of widows between the ages of 60 and 64 was an example. This is another example of the Minister, speaking on behalf of the Secretary of State, clearly laying out that they are creating equality, the foundation stone of which will perpetuate an inequality. That does not bode well for the Bill. I am sorry that we are ending the week on a sour note, but I insist that the amendment is put to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
