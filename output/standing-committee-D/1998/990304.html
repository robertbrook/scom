	<p>10 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Paul Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><q><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Northern Ireland (Modification of Enactments—No. 1) Order 1999.</p></q>
The order is part of the legislation that is needed for the devolution of powers to the Northern Ireland Assembly. It is the second local devolution order to be debated in Parliament. Members of the Committee will recall that the first was the Departments (Northern Ireland) Order 1999.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the order is to amend or repeal certain statutory provisions and to make other provisions in consequence of, or to give effect to the Northern Ireland Act 1998.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a technical order; for the most part, it updates textual references in enactments to, for example, the former Governor and Lord Lieutenant and the Parliament of Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order is not controversial, but I will give examples of how powers that were historically vested in the Lord Lieutenant and the Governor of Northern Ireland, and which went to the Secretary of State under direct rule, will now be vested in the First Minister and deputy First Minister, the relevant Assembly Minister or the Department concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One example is the Petroleum (Consolidation) Act (Northern Ireland) 1929, which deals with the licensing and safe-keeping of petroleum. The Act gave the Governor powers, which were then transferred to the Secretary of State. Those powers will now go to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment. Powers under the Public Records Act (Northern Ireland) 1923 will go to the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure. Powers under the Water and Sewerage Services (Northern Ireland) Order 1973 will go to the First Minister and the deputy First Minister, who will act jointly because they will be responsible for appointments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order is another small but important step towards the devolution process in Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.2 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Moss	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Cambridgeshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are most grateful that the Minister did not consider the order line by line, article by article and group by group. As he rightly said, it is something of a technical order. I cannot claim to have read it in full detail, although I have gone through it as best I can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
The order is obviously important, as the Minister said. It is important to have it in place for the appointed day. It would be helpful if the Minister could clarify what will take place on that day. An order was introduced yesterday in respect of a new Department, which will take over regional planning from the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. These orders will be held in abeyance until the trigger is pulled on the appointed day. Will that day coincide with the Secretary of State using her powers under the d'Hondt principle to set up ministerial bodies and appoint Ministers to the Executive? If there is a link between her doing that and a form of decommissioning that is politically acceptable—certainly to the Unionists in the Assembly—will it be possible to do everything at the same time? Might not the appointed day, on which powers are transferred to the Assembly, predate an agreement on ministerial appointments?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 3 deals with subordinate legislation. I am puzzled as to why such a provision needs to be in the order. If the statutory rule is made before the appointed day, the Assembly cannot annul or revoke it. Why are no transfer powers allotted to the Assembly before the appointed day? I suppose that it could debate annulling or revoking any legislation under the statutory instrument laws passed by the House, but it could not pass a motion to do so. I am sure that it is important to have such a provision, but the Minister's explanation of why it is where it is would be helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rest of the order refers to numerous textual changes. No doubt much time has been spent by officials and civil servants trawling through previous legislation to make sure that nothing has been missed. I would deem it a miracle if everything had been caught in the net, but this may not be the time to go into detail. We know that a great deal of work has gone into it; we hope that everything that needs to be caught has been caught.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We wish the Government godspeed in achieving what they have set out to do. The 10 March deadline is nearly upon us. Certain recent statements suggest that the deadline may not see the coming together of the Belfast agreement. However, we hope that the Government will press on in their endeavours and that, in the not too distant future, we will see the appointed day and a transfer of powers to the new Northern Ireland Assembly. That will mean that all parts of the Belfast agreement have come to fruition. We support the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.7 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Londonderry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The document before us is highly technical. Quite a number of such documents are passing through the House at present, relating to other parts of the United Kingdom, as similar pieces of legislation are in train for Wales and Scotland. It is all very complex and technical. I hope that the parliamentary draftsmen have got it right. I have for a long time been a member of the Joint Statutory Instruments Committee, and we frequently see errors in the technicalities of the orders that come before us. There are sometimes unfortunate downstream consequences if the drafting of the orders is not correct, and this one is particularly important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0347">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
With the help of those who advise us and their eagle eyes, the Joint Statutory Instruments Committee looked at the order a week or so ago, and at the memorandum prepared by the Northern Ireland Office, and accepted it. That is not to say that the draftsmen always get it right. Sometimes things are missed and come back to haunt us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order may be technically correct, and we hope that it is. Whether it is workable in the world of real politics is another matter. Given the result of the opinion polls in the past 24 hours, a very large question mark hangs over this matter. As the Minister knows, I have not one question but a whole series of them regarding the entire process. Whether he and those who support the Government's actions will be proved correct, or whether I will, remains to be seen. As the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss) said, 10 March is galloping up on us, but I do not see anyone galloping to surrender the large quantity of weapons that is required to trigger the whole process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order makes provision to transfer the powers presently held by the Secretary of State and formerly by the Lord Lieutenant, the Government of Northern Ireland and the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland under the Government of Ireland Act 1920. The powers all transfer down to the relevant successors in the Assembly. I note that the order follows the general principle of the 1973 Act in that it devolves named items and retains the rest with the Secretary of State. The 1920 Act operated in exactly the opposite fashion in that it retained named items and devolved the rest. At first sight that does not appear to be a large difference, but in practice it proved to be an enormous difference, because in 1920 all sorts of powers were devolved. It is for that reason that we adopted the current procedure in regard not only to Northern Ireland, but to Wales and Scotland, whereby specific powers are devolved rather than retained. It is a much wiser way to proceed because much greater control is retained over what happens than under the 1920 Act. It is an interesting comparison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the powers are being transferred not to a single individual or body, but to two individuals acting jointly. The First Minister and his deputy will exercise those powers jointly, and I suspect that there will be some friction. The system can only work in practice if the First Minister and the deputy First Minister always agree. The legislation handcuffs them together. Even when the First Minister can command a considerable majority in the Assembly for any proposal, he will still be subject to the will of his deputy. In practice the power-sharing system represents a reversal of the normal process of democracy, in that the will of the majority does not carry, but rather the will of the minority—in this case a minority of one, who can act to thwart the will of everyone else. It is an interesting situation. I find it astonishing that the Minister is holding it up as a paragon of all virtues, when it flies in the face of democracy. It is extraordinary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Friction is inevitable because the stated desires of the two men in question on the constitutional position of Northern Ireland are diametrically opposed. Given the political context of many of the decisions that will be taken, I see, to put it mildly, problems ahead. At the very least, any measures that could be construed as being helpful to the Union will be prevented by the deputy First
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
Minister. He has no choice about that because of the nature of his electorate. The anger that that will cause will result in an extremely interesting relationship between the two men.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a more mundane level, what is the order's practical effect on the negative and affirmative procedures for the rules, orders and instruments that currently come before the House of Commons and will come before the Assembly in future? Will they all be debated? What will actually happen when the powers are devolved? What rules, instruments and orders will still come before Parliament rather than the Assembly? Many people have not yet faced up to the practical consequences of devolution. Presumably, matters that are not devolved will still be dealt with on the Floor of the House and in Committee: they will be the responsibility of the House and the other place. Some will be devolved to the various organisations that will exist in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and, possibly in the near future, in London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members really need to know what will be the practical effects on the procedures of the House. They need to know what they will and will not be able to discuss and in which former areas of responsibility they will be barred from scrutiny, debate and discussion in this place. Will the Government therefore undertake to publish what I would call a plain man's guide to the powers and responsibilities and to the procedures to be followed in future by each Department, covering the entire United Kingdom, including the areas to which the powers are to be devolved, and stating which elements of Government will remain with Parliament? While that may be caught only by a side wind of the legislation, it is relevant in that it will have a tremendous effect on how all these matters are dealt with in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, we are still left with the question of whether Mr. Gerry Adams and his friends want the process to take off at all. If no weapons have been decommissioned by 10 March—let us be honest, that means the surrender of lethal weaponry in fairly large quantities—will the order fall? What will happen if the date is moved from 10 March to 10 April, or even beyond? How will matters be dealt with in the intervening period? In other words, is the order—and all similar orders—tied to a specific date, or is the date a movable feast that can be put back until we see whether all those who have weapons comply with the requirements of the agreement and of the Northern Ireland Act 1998?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.17 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some—but not all—of the points made by the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire were repeated by the hon. Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Ross), so I will try to answer both hon. Gentlemans together where I can, and individually where I cannot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire referred to the legislative sequence that will occur after today. First, the Departments (Northern Ireland) Order 1999, which gives legislative authority to the 11 Northern Ireland Departments, including the Department of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, will, generally, come into force before devolution, and will set up the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0348">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
departmental structures for the purposes of devolution. An important transfer of functions order made under section 4 of the Ministries Act (Northern Ireland) 1944 will also come into force at that time. That will have the effect of ensuring that the functions appropriate to the new and renamed Departments will be in place on devolution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On devolution day, parts II and HI of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, the order with which we are dealing and an order giving legislative effect to the agreed cross-border implementation bodies come into force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire referred to the d'Hondt procedure. That procedure is based on a standing order with which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, as opposed to the Assembly, has the power to deal. She is currently consulting the political parties in Northern Ireland on the draft standing order, and as a result of those consultations will issue—tomorrow, I think, but perhaps a little later—the standing order proper. That then goes to the Assembly, and it will be for the Assembly to deal with the running of the d'Hondt procedure. That will bring into existence as a consequence of the agreement the office of the 10 Ministers. After that, the Secretary of State, by virtue of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, will put before the House of Commons the order that triggers devolution itself. So the House and the other place will determine that. After the order has been approved by Parliament, power is completely transferred, by which time, if the Executive has been formed by the Assembly—running the d'Hondt procedure beforehand, as it must—Ministers will be in office but will be shadow Ministers. They will not become Ministers proper until devolution occurs and powers are transferred to the new body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister clarify the exact role of the presiding officer in the Assembly once standing orders have been issued?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He will have to operate those standing orders; he will be in charge of them and will ensure that the procedure is properly run. Other than that, the presiding officer will have the same duty of any speaker of any assembly or parliament—to act in an impartial way. He will be responsible for the running of the d'Hondt procedure within the Assembly. As the hon. Gentleman knows, that gives parties an automatic right to so many parts of the Executive by virtue of the seats that they have won in the Assembly elections. At the moment, it means three Ministers for the UUP, three for the SDLP, two for the DUP and two for Sinn Fein.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire also referred to the savings provisions for statutory rules in passage when devolution comes into force. Under normal parliamentary procedures, such statutory rules are capable of being annulled, either by the Assembly or at Westminster, during that part of the statutory period which falls after devolution. Under the order's savings provision, such statutory rules will be protected. That is a matter of constitutional propriety; the Assembly should not be in a position to annul statutory rules made under direct rule. It could revoke the rule in question by a new
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
rule, but that is a different matter. In that respect, the savings provision is not new but largely re-enacts provisions in the Northern Ireland Act 1974.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After devolution, it would obviously not be appropriate for Westminster to debate a Northern Ireland statutory rule that was subject to the negative resolution procedure and dealt with a transferred—as opposed to a reserved—matter. Again, if laid before devolution, the rule could be subject to an annulment after the transfer of powers to the Assembly. The order would remove that possibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The essence of it is that transfer powers going to the Assembly—which effectively deal with everything except what the Northern Ireland Office does in relation to criminal justice, for example—will be a matter for the Assembly. It will be able to pass statutory instruments as we do in the House of Commons, either by the negative procedure or the affirmative procedure. Westminster will retain the right to deal with reserve matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of what happens post-devolution is very important—I entirely agree with the hon. Member for East Londonderry about that. There should be a plain man and plain woman's guide to what will happen after devolution. Of course, that applies not only to Northern Ireland, but to Scotland and Wales. However, Northern Ireland is different from any other part of the United Kingdom because of what has occurred in the past in regard to its legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that, for example, the precise role of Members of Parliament will have to be worked out. The President of the Council recently talked about how exactly Members of Parliament would feature in the new regime, what their responsibilities would be and what would happen to the Grand Committee, the Select Committee and Question Time. All that will have to be clearly resolved in the weeks ahead. Come the summer, the Welsh, the Scots and the people of Northern Ireland will have their own assemblies and we will have to know how Parliament is going to deal with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for East Londonderry also mentioned the First and deputy First Ministers—as he made clear in debates on the Northern Ireland Bill, he does not like the idea very much. He said that they would be handcuffed together and that friction might occur. It seems from the diaries of politicians long dead and their accounts of what went on in Cabinets that there were fairly robust disagreements even within the Cabinet system. I accept that this is a different case, but the First and deputy First Ministers will not be handcuffed as a result of the legislation. The handcuffing results from the agreement; the legislation simply enacts what the agreement said.

funding, there was no question in my mind that those leaders of unionist and nationalist parties worked together remarkably well to get the best possible deal for Northern Ireland. I think that that will also apply to other aspects of government in the Province.

I have covered most of the points that were raised, but I shall write to the hon. Member for East Londonderry about those that I might have missed. It is a technical

order, but it is important and ensures that we go that one step further towards the devolution of powers to the people of Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
