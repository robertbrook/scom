Draft Industrial Training Levy (Construction Board) Order 1999</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mr. George Mudie)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Industrial Training Levy (Construction Board) Order 1999.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the draft Industrial Training Levy (Engineering Construction Board) Order 1999.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mudie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure, Mr. Olner, to be in a Committee under your firm, but fair, chairmanship.<br><br>
The proposals seek authority for the Construction Industry Training Board and the Engineering Construction Industry Training Board to impose a levy on employers in their industries to finance their training activities, including grant schemes, and to fund the operating costs of the boards. Provision for that is contained in the Industrial Training Act 1982, and the orders will give effect to proposals submitted by the two boards. The proposals from each board include provision to raise a levy in excess of 1 per cent. of an employer's payroll. The 1982 Act requires that, in such cases, the proposals must be approved by affirmative resolution of both Houses.<br><br>
In each case, the proposals are based on employers' payrolls and their use of subcontract labour. As required by the 1982 Act, both boards have provided for the exemption of small firms from the levy. The level at which that exemption takes effect is unchanged from last year, and aims to strike the right balance between helping small firms to grow and giving them unfair commercial advantage. However, the boards are committed to supporting the training efforts of small firms, whether or not they pay the levy. All companies need a skilled, competent work force if they are to be competitive. Small firms in those sectors are encouraged to take advantage of the services offered by the boards and to provide opportunities for trainees and apprentices.<br><br>
In the case of the Engineering Construction Training Board, the proposals are different from those that were approved by the House last year in that the higher rate on net payments made by employers for labour-only services has been removed. That is because the rationale for the different rates was questioned in the last independent review of the board, and the board was recommended to move to a single rate. Moveover, the rate for off-site establishments is reduced.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
The Engineering Construction Training Board treats off-site establishments and construction sites separately and proposes to raise a two-part levy. For off-site employers, the rate will be reduced from 0.4 per cent. to 0.18 per cent. of the total of payroll and net expenditure on labour-only subcontracting. Off-site employers with 40 or fewer employees are exempt from paying the levy. The rate for site employers will be 1.5 per cent. of the total of payroll and net expenditure on labour-only subcontracting. As required under the Industrial Training Act 1982, there is exemption for site employers with combined payroll and net labour-only payments of £75,000 or less.<br><br>
The Construction Industry Training Board proposes to raise a two-part levy: 0.38 per cent. of payroll and 2.28 per cent. of net expenditure by employers on labour-only subcontracting. Employers with combined payroll and labour-only payments of less than £61,000 are exempt from paying the levy. Those rates represent an increase for directly employed labour—the previous rate was 0.29 per cent. The board states that that increase is necessary for two reasons. First, continuing changes in employment practices in the industry significantly affect levy arrangements. Secondly, employers are still moving from labour-only subcontracting towards direct employment. As the levy on labour-only subcontracting is at a higher rate, that has led to a reduction in the board's income.<br><br>
At the same time, the greater numbers of direct employers is expected to lead to an increase in the amount of training carried out and a corresponding increase in grant and other support provided by the board.<br><br>
The last independent review of the board also questioned the rationale for the different rates, and the recommendation that it should move towards a single rate. Subject to further consultation with the industry, it is planned that that measure will be phased in over the next four years—that is, before the next quinquennial review.<br><br>
For both boards, the proposals involve levy rates in excess of 0.2 per cent. with no provision for exempting employers who make their own training arrangements. In such cases, the Industrial Training Act 1982 requires boards to demonstrate that the proposals have the support of the employers in the industry. I am satisfied that each board has obtained that support.<br><br>
The proposals are expected to raise nearly £61 million for the CITB and about £10 million for the ECITB. Both boards will use the money to fund a range of training activities, including grant and initiative schemes, new entrant training and operating costs.<br><br>
The Committee will know from previous debates that the CITB and the ECITB are the only statutory industry training boards. The reviews of the boards looked at the need for their continuance, and included a survey of the views of employers in each sector. The reviews concluded that both boards were widely supported by employers and sectoral interest groups and that, without them, training in their sectors would deteriorate. Each board has developed detailed action
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0015">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
plans that address the specific objectives and recommendations of the reviews. The boards are already starting to increase their effectiveness and further develop their capabilities, especially at strategic levels.<br><br>
I am pleased to tell the Committee that each board has successfully completed its first year as a government-recognised national training organisation for its sector. That is an important development, because it places the boards firmly within the national network of sector-level training organisations, which is now largely complete, and it puts a new emphasis on strategic activities and partnerships. That is helping them to contribute even further to the national skills strategy. For example, both boards have developed nationally recognised labour market assessment systems, which will contribute to the important work of the regional develpoment agencies and the national skills task force. Each board has set up new deal initiatives.<br><br>
During the past year, I have met Hugh Try, chairman of the CITB, and Norman Dunlop, chairman of the ECITB. I take this opportunity to put on record the thanks of the Department and the Government to Norman Dunlop, who stands down as chairman this year. He has held that post for many years and has given great service to the industry and to training in the industry. I know that Hugh and Norman are committed to ensuring that their boards provide a quality service to employers in their industries, and I thank them and their staff for their hard work.<br><br>
The draft orders will enable the two boards to carry out their training responsibilities in 1999, and it is right that the Committee should approve them. I commend them to the Committee.</span></p>
<p>4.38 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Damian Green <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ashford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I join the Minister in welcoming you to the Chair, Mr. Olner. I thank the Minister for his full and clear exposition of the orders. The Committee will be glad to hear that the boards are taking a more strategic role in the wake of the last quinquennial reviews. The Opposition join the Minister in thanking those who run the boards for their hard work during the past 12 months.<br><br>
The Committee will be aware that the boards have survived whereas other similar training boards were found not to be useful in their sectors. One thing that we have all learnt over the past couple of years is that such reviews are instructive, because the boards and those who work in them must prove their continuing usefulness. Over time, that will enable them to improve their performance, and will be good for them and for the industries that they serve.<br><br>
Opposition Members agree that the boards should continue to operate as long as the industries themselves want them to do so. I am also aware that, as the Minister mentioned, both boards have made efforts to appear less monolithic than they sometimes have in the past to the industries that they try to serve.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
That can only be a good thing for the future of those industries, and in particular for the future of training provision in the industries.<br><br>
The Committee should emphasise the important balance between maintaining fairness and a level playing field—to allow training to continue and the vast number of small companies in the industries to gain the benefits of a trained work force—and the possibility of over-intrusion by Government or the boards. How does the Minister propose to respond to the request to consider lowering the threshold for entry to the scheme in either or both of the boards? Similarly, is he considering mandatory registration of firms? He will be aware of a long-standing problem of evasion of the levy in the industries. Which way is his thinking moving on those important issues?<br><br>
We are aware of the problems of rebalancing the rates between the labour-only subcontracting rate and the payroll rate. I shall refer in a moment to the losers from that, but there are winners, hence the CITB's desire for a lower threshold. I urge the Minister to be especially aware of the danger of being over-intrusive and, similarly, of placing unnecessary burdens on small businesses.<br><br>
The losers in the rebalancing will end up paying a higher levy. I am sure that the Minister is aware that, for some of the larger firms in the industry, that could be quite serious. The percentage increases sound small but in fact constitute an increase of about a third. An employer with 1,000 employees and a payroll of £20 million a year currently pays a levy to the CITB of about £58,000, whereas the increase would result in a levy of about £77,000. Therefore, at the very time when the construction industry is trying to cope with the recession that is coming—or that is already here for some sectors—it faces an increase in the levy. I should be interested to hear the Minister's comments on the possible effects on future employment in the industry of that extra burden on large construction companies.<br><br>
The Minister mentioned the Government's other training efforts with which the two boards are associated. I ask him to give us more information, especially about the new deal for construction, on which the CITB's levy will have a significant effect. As he will be aware, some anecdotal evidence suggests that it is proving difficult to assemble sufficiently large cohorts of potential trainees to make training cost effective. What do the board and, more widely, the Government propose to do about that? The Minister will also be aware of complaints that trainees who leave the new deal gateway halfway through, moving on to an employer-paid training course, are in danger of losing their funding, which is obviously a great worry. I should be grateful if the Minister would clarify that. With those caveats and questions, which I hope the Minister will address, I accept that the orders should proceed, and we shall not seek to divide the Committee on the matter.</span></p>
<p>4.44 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paul Keetch <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hereford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, should like to say what a great pleasure it is to be on a Committee under your Chairmanship, Mr. Olner. I have got to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0016">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
know you on several other occasions in the 18 months that I have been a Member of the House. It is also a pleasure to speak in support of the order.<br><br>
There is much to be learnt from the training boards in devising our approach to the immediate need for training within sectors and the longer term need for strategic national planning. It is important to consider what the training boards are doing. The training boards have created a national training strategy for the industries that they serve, and perhaps our most important question should be whether the Government have a national training strategy for other sectors.<br><br>
The collapse of the apprenticeship system and the deindustrialisation of the British economy have intensified the de-skilling of the labour force and undermined the quality of many people in work, especially those who have found academic education hard-going. Because of that, the training boards—[<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Hon. Members should listen to the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Keetch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Olner.<br><br>
The training boards are a powerful exemplar of the future of industrial and national training policy. Many people understand that the education system sometimes seems preoccupied with academic education whereas the training boards are often concerned with inclusive, vocational education. The CITB, for example, has a powerful record. In 1998, it issued 23,000 construction industry national vocational qualifications and made a further 25,500 registrations; it also supported 4,000 other new trainees. It created a new on-site training and assessment initiative with over 15,000 new entrant trainees. I do not hear Labour Back-Bench Members complaining about that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rogers</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hereford (Mr. Keetch) referred to Back Benchers; he does not understand that we—especially the ex-soldiers among us—are here today as a punishment battalion. Our role is to sit down and shut up. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman realises that many of us know a little about the history of education and training. I wish that he would speak to the order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Keetch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that demonstrating the role of the CITB was speaking to the order. I do not understand military parlance, but I have enough military knowledge, gleaned from my constituency work, to understand the role of support troops as opposed to that of the specialist forces employed on the Front Bench.<br><br>
The CITB understands that the advantage of on-site training schemes is that training is made available to those who are unhappy with an academic environment. More importantly, the drop-out rate of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
those trained by the CITB is half that of those attending colleges. The creation of construction industry training centres that teach specialist building, civil engineering and associated skills has benefited thousands of excluded pupils. It is a second chance for many of them. That is why the Liberal Democrats support the levy and why training boards are important. They are national, effective and fair.<br><br>
An industry-wide levy enables costs to be spread throughout the industry, and allows the creation of an infrastruture for long-term planning for the whole industry and a national training approach. That is strategic thinking at its best. Even bad employers have to participate and cannot opt out. With no fixed sites and no continuity of work in the construction industry, the training boards often encourage high-quality training and the maintenance of high-quality standards. I ran a small construction business in the City and I know how important it is to train people so that they are correctly qualified. That is the benefit of the training boards.<br><br>
Employers support the training levy because training boards act as fine ambassadors, promoting their industry as a career. If the Government support the good work of the two training boards, does the Minister agree that the policy of a compulsory levy should be extended to other industries? Are there not other sectors that might—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member is straying from the subject.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Keetch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Olner.<br><br>
Returning to the subject of the training boards, I have witnessed the benefits of the CITB and other industrial training boards. They train young car mechanics, operatives and skilled people—people involved in the industries that they know about. Many of those people have been excluded from academic training, yet the vocational training offered by the training boards is important to them. The boards are supported by many people in the industry. I have mentioned employers, but it is interesting to note the organisations within the construction industry that support the CITB, such as the Construction Federation, the Federation of Master Builders and the Federation of Specialist Sub-Contractors. That is why the Liberal Democrat party supports the concept of training boards and wants it extended.</span></p>
<p>4.49 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paul Willis <span class='memberconstituency'>(Harrogate and Knaresborough)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not detain the Committee long, but I want to raise the issue of employers paying twice, to which the Minister alluded, as did the hon. Member for Ashford (Mr. Green). I am sure that the Minister will agree that large, responsible employers not only rely on training boards to offer training through the levy, but provide enormous additional training themselves. If more
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0017">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
employers are to become involved, especially those which the hon. Member for Ashford said are constantly trying to avoid having to pay their dues, there must be an incentive. I should be grateful if the Minister would explain why the Government have ruled out the idea of the levy being remissible, and why the money that employers spend on other forms of training cannot be set against the levy that they send to the boards.</span></p>
<p>4.50 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mudie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal briefly with some of the points that have been raised. The hon. Member for Ashford referred to small firms and exemption levels. That is always the most sensitive issue. One of the boards is anxious for the exemption level to be lowered, but a balance must be struck between firms with very small labour forces, and larger firms. I think that firms that employ four members of staff whose salaries amount to £61,000 are exempt, which is a fairly low level of exemption.<br><br>
However, the Government are conscious of what was said at the election. If we were debating small firms in another context, we would be very protective of them and be aware of any charges that were imposed on them, which is how we are approaching these proposals. The Government are not minded to allow an exception, but will keep the matter under review each year and listen to the arguments that are advanced. This year, we carried out a survey of the firms within the industry, and the feedback that we received was that such a proposal would not be supported.<br><br>
I have advised the boards that I am willing to consider their proposals for mandatory registration, including full details of resources required, expected benefits and bureaucratic implications.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Green</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister decides to introduce mandatory registration, will that be done next year under the order or can it be done in the interim period?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mudie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For the sake of stability, I should be inclined to introduce such a measure at the time of the review unless there were compelling reasons for not doing so. People in the industry want to know where they stand for the year ahead, and the last thing they would want is for the policy to be chopped and changed. Without help or advice from anywhere else, my initial reaction is that it would be sensible to let the year run, listen to the evidence and introduce the proposal at the time of the annual review. We are required to return to Committee to make such changes.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hereford was not given a rough ride, but there was some impatience, and I am sorry about that because his support for the two boards was very vocal. The boards have worked hard.<br><br>
I have come fresh to the job, and have been around the country visiting colleges and sites. I was in Bolton yesterday, and one of the boards has developed a roofing operation at Bolton college. Such a training scheme did not exist two or three years ago. It has vastly improved the facilities of the college and is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
making roofing training in the north of England a reality. As we all know, roofing was on occasions—I am not speaking of the boards' operations—one of the more doubtful parts of the construction trade. I was pleased to see people of all ages receiving first-class training. I was interested to hear that one of the reasons why that facility cannot be extended is that, because of the lack of training in that part of the industry in the past few years, the college is having difficulty finding people who can lecture on the subject, other than on cutting corners.<br><br>
As I said, I am sorry that there was such impatience so early in the new year in a Committee that clearly has time to discuss such matters. The new deal was mentioned. I have not come across any difficulty. I am sure that the Minister for Employment, Welfare to Work and Equal Opportunities would love me to put the figures on the record: we have helped over 90,000 people into jobs, training or work experience, 52,800 of whom have received secure jobs, and 39,800 of those jobs are unsubsidised.<br><br>
As I have visited colleges, I have had an odd feeling that synchronisation is a problem. Sometimes people are held in a gateway for too long, while an appropriate point in college education is arrived at, rather than the college being flexible enough to take people out of one gateway whenever they are deemed appropriate for another.<br><br>
Many people have expressed concern about the length of time permitted for a gateway in college under the new deal. Apart from that, no other major complaints have been drawn to my attention. The colleges are becoming more aware of, and experienced in, the new deal and they are making better arrangements. The scheme is working—52,800 people have secure jobs. I ask the Committee to agree to the orders.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister respond to the question that I asked about making the levy remissible?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mudie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) is asking about firms that pay money but receive no training. Is my understanding correct?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Willis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can assist the Minister. It is my understanding that companies are obliged to pay the levy if they belong to a training board. However, if they provide additional training facilities and opportunities, they pay twice. Sometimes they do not take advantage of the training board's facilities. Therefore, as we want to encourage more training, the levy should be remissible. The money that firms pay should be offset against the money that they spent on private training. That would encourage more companies to become involved in broader-based training, which is the Government's intention.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mudie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting point, and I am happy to consider it for a future review period. However, I am very careful. Every penny going into training is necessary, and before an impetuous move is made, I should like to consider the matter further.</span></p>
