	<br><q><p>That the Committee has considered the Fire Precautions (Workplace) (Amendment) Regulations 1999 (S.I., 1999, No. 1877).</p></q>
I start, Mr. Gale, by welcoming you to the Chair. I am sure that your impartial rod of iron will ensure fair debate this morning. I wish also to express my appreciation that it has been possible, through the usual channels, to arrange a debate on the regulations. They are a matter of complicated detail that will affect a large number of employers, and it would have been wrong to allow them to go through Parliament without open discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to concentrate on four aspects of the regulations and I shall ask the Minister to explain the Government's position in greater detail. I hope that he will provide reassurance. First, is there a legal necessity for the regulations, and are they needed for us to comply with the relevant EC directives? Secondly, will the Minister say something about the legislative overlap between the regulations and certification procedures under the Fire Precautions Act 1971? Thirdly, can he allay my anxiety about the additional burdens that the regulations may place on British businesses and our fire services? Fourthly, will the Minister say how the regulations fit into the Government's declared strategy for a comprehensive overhaul and consolidation of fire safety legislation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand the text of the regulations, the prime purpose of the change is to end a series of exemptions that were embodied in the Fire Precautions (Workplace) Regulations 1997. Until the amending regulations were made, various categories of employers were exempt from the regulations and the duties that the regulations placed upon employers. The most significant category, at least numerically, was workplaces where a fire certificate was in force or was being sought under the provisions of the 1971 Act. Various other categories were exempt, including sports grounds and stands where a safety certificate was in force, subsurface railway stations, ships being built or repaired, buildings at the surface of mines, and workplaces that were subject to the Fire Certificates (Special Premises) Regulations 1976.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
I want to focus on the largest category of employers affected by the regulations—shops, offices and factories that are already covered by certification arrangements under the 1971 Act. The Home Office estimate is that about 137,000 workplaces that were not previously subject to the regulations will be brought within their ambit. The Government's justification for ending the exemptions that were embodied in regulations as recently as 1997 is that it is necessary in order to comply with European law and to avoid the risk of infraction proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a written answer of 8 April 1998, at column 	<i>255</i> of the 	<i>Official Report,</i> the Minister's predecessor, the hon. Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East (Mr. Howarth) said that, following representations from the then Commissioner Flynn, the Government had decided to take further action. I regret that the Government have not released the text of the Commissioner's letter, which apparently threatened infraction proceedings. I realise that successive Governments have followed a policy of not releasing into the public domain correspondence from the Commission, but the Minister may want to reconsider that policy in the context of forthcoming freedom of information legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have read the directives on which Commissioner Flynn's representations seem to have been based. As I understand it, the Commission is saying that the text of our law prior to these amendming regulations fails to comply with the duties imposed on employers in general by the directives. Is that so, or could a strong argument be made for saying that it is possible to comply with the directives without this further imposition of a regulatory burden on employers?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 1 of the framework directive of 12 June 1989 states:
	<br><q><p>"This Directive shall be without prejudice to existing or future national and Community provisions which are more favourable to protection of the safety and health of workers at work."</p></q>
That suggests that it might be argued that, if our certification arrangements under the 1971 Act are held to provide a superior form of protection to that required under the regulations, the certification procedures alone should be sufficient for the United Kingdom to say that it is complying adequately with the directives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, article 5(2) of the directive places duties on employers who enlist external services or persons to help them discharge their health and safety responsibilities. Is certification in breach of that if an employer acts, following advice from the fire authority, to introduce certain measures required to secure a fire certificate? Would that not constitute discharging his duty as an employer under the terms of the directives?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assume that, in 1997, when the Government introduced their original fire precautions regulations, including the various exemptions that they are now removing, Ministers took legal advice on whether those regulations complied with the relevant European
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0289">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
Community directives. Has the Government's legal advice changed in the interim? They considered the matter as recently as 1997, and thought then that it was possible to justify exemptions within the terms of the directives. What has changed, in terms of the Government's legal advice, that justifies their introducing these new burdens now? Are the Government in assessing the risk to themselves simply nervous about incurring the costs and the risk involved in a case being presented to the European Court of Justice? Does the Department see the regulations as a quicker and, from the Government's point of view, cheaper way out of their dilemma?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the position with regard to other member states of the European Union? I understand that a 1993 study of the implementation of European legislation showed that other member states were not complying with European legal requirements on health and safety. Are other countries still failing to implement or enforce the standards required under European directives? Is the Commission taking, or threatening to take, infraction proceedings against those countries?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most employers in Britain would argue that the combination of our health and safety legislation, fire precautions regulations and fire certification procedures provides an objectively high standard of protection for employees against the risk of fire at the workplace. British employers would reasonably question whether every other member state of the EU meets our existing standards, let alone the higher ones being imposed under the amending regulations. Does a level playing field exist across the EU?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of legislative overlap, many employers are required to obtain fire certificates under the 1971 Act, in addition to which they will have to undertake the formal assessment procedure required under the fire regulations. Under the 1971 Act, an employer who is in the category designated by order must apply to his fire authority for a fire certificate. He must provide the fire authority with detailed information, including detailed plans of his premises. A fire authority inspection usually takes place. The fire authority can insist that new equipment or doors are installed, or that staff undergo new training procedures and so on. Finally, when the conditions have been complied with, a certificate is granted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems that many employers will have to comply with two distinct, but overlapping, fire safety procedures. Inevitably, that will be burdensome in terms of their time and, therefore, costs. I accept that the Government have drafted the regulations so that employers can avoid the risk of criminal sanctions if the fire certificate and the fire regulations are contradictory. However, I should like the Minister to answer some questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, can an employer use the assessment procedures, which he will be obliged to follow under the regulations, to qualify for a certificate, or can the work that he must undertake in preparing to qualify for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
a certificate count as evidence of due diligence towards completing the formal assessment procedure? Can those two different duties of compliance be merged so that the employer does not have formally to conduct what will often be the same tasks twice to meet those different legal obligations?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, will the Minister explain why the Government have apparently decided not to amend the Fire Precautions (Factories, Offices, Shops and Railway Premises) Order 1989, given that doing so was mooted by the Government in their consultation document as a possible means to reduce the legislative overlap? In its response to the consultation document, the Federation of Small Businesses suggests a general exemption for low to medium risk premises, subject to a fire certificate, if companies have fewer than 50 employees. The Chief and Assistant Chief Fire Officers Association argues that fire authorities should be given complete discretion to exempt categories of companies from the certification requirements under the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the legislative overlap and, therefore, the discretion that fire authorities are likely to have, I hope that the Minister agrees that the Home Office needs to issue some guidance to fire authorities, so that a common approach exists around the country and that individual employers—especially those with different premises in different fire authority areas—know where they stand and know that common standards apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's estimate of potential new burdens on employers and fire authorities is modest and imprecise: the compliance cost assessment lists new costs of between £2.3 million and £28.22 million. The Confederation of British Industry and the Federation of Small Businesses both believe that that is a large underestimate of the actual costs that employers might incur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the compliance cost assessment, the Government believe that most certificated premises will already have the necessary fire-fighting equipment, so there will be little if any capital cost involved to comply with the new regulations. However, the Federation of Small Businesses argues that premises certified between 1977 and 1985 will not meet current standards for fire-resisting doors, and that many factories, offices and shops will have to install additional emergency lighting because of the regulations, even though that is not currently required as a condition of their fire certificates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The duties imposed on employers under the regulations are formal and might be burdensome. As I understand the subject, employers are required to make formal assessments of fire risk, of whether anyone will be hurt if fire occurs and of whether safety arrangements are Satisfactory or action needs taking. If employers have more than five employees, they must keep written records of the significant findings of fire risk assessments and the measures proposed to deal with those findings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0290">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
A checklist in the Home Office's recently published document "Fire Safety: An employer's guide" recommends that employers ask themselves 33 detailed questions and lists numerous other measures for employers to consider during their assessment. For example, employers are required to prepare an emergency plan and to provide training for employees. In practice, most employers will want to check with their fire authority that the assessment and certification procedures are not in conflict as regards their company. To prove due diligence, they will also feel the need to record formally details of equipment testing and of the periods of staff instruction and training that they have provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That will add up to a burden considerably more time consuming and costly than the Government predict in their compliance cost assessment. For example, they assume that an employer will conduct risk assessment in one and a half hours, that a staff training period will take no more than 20 minutes and that assessment and training costs will largely be absorbed in the employer's existing health and safety work. So far as I can tell, the Government's calculation makes no allowance for the preparation of the emergency plan. That strikes me as an unrealistically low estimate of the burden on employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also challenge the Government's estimate of the individual costs of operations involved in the assessment procedure. For example, the Government say that to employ a consultant to perform a risk assessment would cost the average employer £616. In 1996, however, the British Retail Consortium estimated that it would cost an employer £1,000. Similarly, the Government believe that it would take one and half hours at £11 an hour—a total of £16.50—for employers to perform their own risk assessments in house. Three years ago, the British Retail Consortium estimated the cost of self-assessment at £10 an hour—roughly in line with the Government's current estimate of the hourly cost—but the time taken, as four or eight hours, depending on the complexity of the premises and the number of sites where an in-house assessment is to be carried out, giving a cost of between £40 and £80, rather than the Government's estimate of £16.50.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister can provide assurance that the Government have looked closely at the question of additional costs to business and that they take seriously the concerns that have been expressed by the representative organisations of small and large businesses alike. I hope, too, that they have given thought to the costs for the fire service. It is likely that more employers, following the regulations, will seek advice and assistance from fire authorities, and CACFOA believes that the more employers understand the legal requirement for them to undertake a formal risk assessment procedure, the more they will ask for fire authority help, which will in turn present fire
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
authorities with difficult decisions in regard to priorities and expenditure, at a time when many are finding their budgets already stretched.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I press the Minister to say where the regulations fit into the Government's overall strategy and their promise that we will eventually see a comprehensive overhaul and consolidation of fire safety legislation. Everybody the different political parties and the fire service alike, recognises the need for such an overhaul. I have seen a letter from the Devon Fire and Rescue Service which lists 85 Acts of Parliament and sets of regulations which deal with fire safety and fire precautions matters. The legislation covering this area is very fragmented and it is difficult for employers and the fire service to come to a coherent view of where the law stands and what duties have to be carried out to comply with the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have promised us a revised consolidated fire safety Bill, so why do they now need to push forward with this piecemeal amendment to the 1997 legislation? Have the Government put the proposal for a consolidated fire safety Bill on the legislative back burner? Do they think it more important to find time for other items of legislation during the forthcoming parliamentary Session and will we see fire safety relegated to a low priority? The overhaul of fire safety law is wanted by the fire service, fire authorities and business.'
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In its response to the Government's consultation document, the Confederation of British Industry said bluntly:
	<br><q><p>"the CBI find that the repeated small revisions to the legislation are unacceptable."</p></q>
The CBI wants a shift towards a system whereby fire safety legislation is based on the notion of risk assessment, but believes:
	<br><q><p>"This can only be achieved by a fundamental change of primary legislation which has been fully consulted on. The risks of rolling back the old system without properly rolling out the new are considerable and pose risks not only for the business and the public but also for the Home Office and the fire authority if an incident occurs."</p></q>
The demand for that shift towards new, all-embracing, fire safety legislation is widespread. It is a pity that instead of introducing such a Bill, or at the least a White Paper to point the way forward, the Government feel obliged to come forward with this piecemeal amendment. It suggests that we cannot expect a general fire safety Bill for another 12 months at the very least.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that when the Minister replies, he will not only answer my detailed points, but can say that the comprehensive revision of our safety legislation will remain at the forefront of the Home Office's concerns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

the Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East— now the Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland—on 8 July. They are due to come into force on 31 December 1999 and will give effect to the Government's decision to take the necessary steps to meet the concerns expressed by the European Commission about the United Kingdom's implementation of the general fire safety provisions of European Council directives 89/391/EEC and 89/654/EEC, which are known as the framework and workplace directives respectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations had to be amended because the United Kingdom Government and our European partners recognised that there were inequalities and deficiencies in health and safety protection for workers. We determined that action should be taken across the Community to an agreed minimum level. the regulations provide the means of showing in domestic legislation the agreed minimum standards for fire safety in the workplace. in some workplaces, the only laws applicable were general duties of care, so we needed to make explicit what is implicit in those general duties by reference to the minimum requirements of the relevant European directives, which the previous Government agreed with our European partners. These regulations make the position much clearer for employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington) raised a number of detailed points, which I shall deal with as I proceed. It is necessary for the UK to implement in domestic legislation the requirements of all European Council directives to which we have signed up, including the provisions of the framework and workplace directives. They were adopted by the Council in 1989 for good and precise reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both directives place the primary responsibility for ensuring health and safety in the workplace, including safety from fire, on employers. This requires employers to assess the likelihood of fire and its consequences for those in the workplace and to take appropriate measures to reduce or eliminate such risks. The Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1992 and the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992 implemented many of the provisions of the directives, including the requirement to make a health and safety risk assessment. These regulations took effect on 1 January 1993. However, regulations to implement most of the general fire safety provisions of the directives—the Fire Precautions (Workplace) Regulations 1997—were not made until July 1997. They came into fore at the end of November/start of December 1997.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for seeking to amend the 1997 regulations, as the hon. Member for Aylesbury suggested, was that on examining how the issue had been dealt with, the European Commission took the view that the regulations did not fully comply with the directives. Our legal advisers had suggested that we would comply with the directives by passing the 1997
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
regulations. However, when the Commission looked at how the matter had been interpreted—it is looking at several other countries—it took the view that the UK was not fully compliant, and made representations to us about the way in which we had approached these matters. Our legal advisers listened carefully to those representations and concluded that the views expressed by the Commission were indeed right, and that we needed to amend the regulations to comply fully with the directives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Aylesbury rightly asks whether that means that the lawyers changed their minds. It does not work like that. In any debate with lawyers, a point of view is expressed and it is then debated. Put two lawyers in a room and you have a debate; put three lawyers in a room and you have a serious argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Brady 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Altrincham and Sale, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not a lawyer, so I am not seeking to defend the profession. Is it the Minister's and his Department's legal opinion that the regulations do the minimum required to bring UK law into line with the requirements of the directives, or do they go beyond that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The way in which we have proceeded is to comply, as far as we are required to do, with the directives. That does not impose any undue burdens. Indeed, certain aspects of the regulations may reduce some of the burdens. We have discussed the matter fully with business representatives. I shall come to the issue of the burden on business and the points made by the hon. Member for Aylesbury. We have sought to ensure that we comply with the directives without goldplating them. We are responding to the Commission's legitimate concerns and we want to ensure that we comply with our EU obligations. We also want to make sure that our compliance is in keeping with the way in which we have always done things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After 1989, some initial regulations were put in place by the previous Government in 1992 and 1993. There was a wide-ranging consultation process and a view was taken by our lawyers in 1997 that we were complying with the directives, under the regulations that we had introduced. However, we then listened to the Commission and accepted that it was right. Our legal advisers agreed that although they had thought previously that we were complying with the directives, they now accepted that the lawyers for the Commission were correct. We have, therefore, introduced these regulations, which amend the position in a way that will satisfy the requirements of the directives, impose a usable regime for the fire authorities and will not be too burdensome on business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Commission has been pursuing a detailed examination of member states' transposition of the framework and workplace directives, focusing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0292">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
on differences between the text of the directives and that of national laws. It expressed concern that the text of our existing legislation, which applies to the workplaces excepted from the 1997 regulations—among them, premises certificated under the Fire Precautions Act 1971—did not implement the requirements of the directives in full by applying those requirements directly upon all employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission was also concerned that the duties placed on employers by the 1997 regulations should fully reflect the unconditional nature of the responsibilities and obligations imposed on employers by the framework directive. That is to say, employers have ultimate responsibility for the safety of their employees in case of fire, even where others have obligations to ensure that the requirements of the regulations are complied with. This responsibility extends to employers whose premises were excepted from the 1997 regulations—hence the need to apply the regulations explicitly and in full to those employers by removing exceptions from the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, we announced in April 1998 that the Government would take the steps necessary to comply fully with the terms of the 1989 framework directive. Last autumn, we held a full, three-month public consultation on proposals to extend the application of the 1997 regulations by removing some of the exemptions, and to assess the operation and effectiveness of the enforcement regime that applies under part IV of the 1997 regulations. The amending regulations, which are the subject of widespread agreement, including among many small businesses, are the culmination of that work. The Confederation of British Industry and the Federation of Small Businesses, among others, initially expressed reasoned and serious anxieties, and the Government have dealt with many of those anxieties. Although we could not deal with all of them, we have gone as far as is reasonably possible in helping employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Aylesbury suggested, we shall make guidance available to ensure that employers and fire authorities understand the regulations and are not confused. It is important to avoid confusion, especially on the part of employers who want to comply with the regulations and to know precisely what they have to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Aylesbury also referred to the guidance that has already been published. We shall want to make clear to employers' organisations and employers generally what they need to do. We shall avoid duplications and the problems of overlap, to which the hon. Gentleman also referred and to which I shall return in a moment. We aim to ensure that employers have clear guidance on how to comply with the regulations and on employers' obligations, so that they know and have a checklist of what they need to do. I hope that that will deal with the hon. Gentleman's
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
anxieties. I am happy to give him the assurance that we shall do all that we can to ensure that guidance is available and publicised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Guidance has been issued, subject to the Committee's decisions on the regulations, but it was considered essential that employers should have the maximum time possible to understand and meet their fire safety responsibilities. It will, therefore, be some time before we impose those obligations, to enable employers to consider the new guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New guidance on the enforcement provisions and the other requirements of the amended regulations will be issued to fire authorities later this month. The consultation of interested parties was concluded on 29 October. The fire authorities, whose duty it is to enforce the regulations, will be expected to act in full accordance with the policy and principles of the March 1998 enforcement concordat between business and the fire authorities on the implementation of the requirements of fire regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to the burden on business, the regulatory impact assessment that the Home Office completed and that was attached to the 1999 regulations when they were laid before Parliament was conducted in full compliance with Cabinet Office guidelines. As the hon. Member for Aylesbury said, some organisations would have done it differently, and some employers may have paid their consultants more than the fee cited in the example of consultants' costs for 10 hours' work—£550 for consultants' costs, and £66 for training costs, totalling £616. The hon.Member for Aylesbury suggests that some employers may have paid more. To some extent, more fool them—they seem to be paying over the odds. The Cabinet Office guidelines suggest that those are realistic figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The example given in the regulatory impact assessment is worth citing so that businesses have an idea of the compliance costs. A notional business, occupying a two-storey workplace that is subject to the terms of a fire certificate issued under the Fire Precautions Act 1971 and employing, for example, 18 members of staff, that opts to carry out a fire risk assessment in house, the assumption is that the cost of purchasing guidance will be £9.95, that it will take an hour to read and digest the guidance, costing £11, that a risk assessment will take about one a and a half hours, costing £16.50, and that it will take 20 minutes to train each member of staff, costing £66. Therefore, the total cost for the workplace will be £103.45, of which £9.95 is non-recurring. The £82.50 spent on risk assessment and training may be subsumed within existing legal requirements for health and safety risk assessment and training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Larger and more complex businesses might employ a consultant. The hon. Member for Aylesbury and I have discussed the appropriate fee that such consultants should be paid. Those are burdens that we are imposing. However, the hon. Gentleman rightly said that 137, 000 companies might be affected, so we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0293">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
expect that the cost of implementing the regulations will be between £2.3 million and £28.2 million, depending on the circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The workplaces to which the 1997 regulations, as amended, apply, such as fire-certificated premises, already have generally high standards of fire safety. By and large, the United Kingdom has high standards of fire safety, but some employers do not always comply with the safety regulations. There are sweatshops and employers who fail to do what they should. We must ensure that they comply so that we safeguard their workers, which we shall do under this regulatory system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those employers who already meet the requirements of existing legislation, including the general duty of care, will have little to do. My hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, North and Sefton, East, when the Under-Secretary of State, Home Department, signed the declaration of assessment, and we believe that it strikes the necessary balance. The requirements in the regulations are generally already met. Most businesses will be required to do only a little more. The regulations will not impose excessive burdens on businesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During our discussions with businesses, we considered the balance between civil and criminal sanctions to ensure that we got it right. One of the key changes of the regulations will affect that balance. Most employers have been convinced that criminal sanctions are best for several reasons. Such sanctions are less likely to be used arbitrarily. A careful decision has to be taken before imposing them, which is normally done only when serious breach of the regulations has occurred. The civil sanctions previously imposed might be used more often.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A concordat exists between employers and fire authorities, whereby employers are informed and required to comply if action needs to be taken following an inspection. That is not a litigious system; it is more an agreement between fire authorities and employers to behave in a certain way, and it normally works well in this country. We can therefore dispense with some of the civil sanctions. That is not necessarily a lifting of burdens; rather, it is a clarification of the approach that we want to take.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick St. Aubyn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Guildford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will deal with the curious exemptions for ships within the meaning of section 313 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 referred to in paragraph 9 of the amended schedule to the 1997 regulations. Given that we are now talking about criminal sanctions, it is a curious provision. Will the Minister spell out when and where the regulations will apply?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No Doubt, I shall be able to do that shortly. I, too, have been curious about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I shall comment on the legislative overlap and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
then deal with some of the other points raised by the hon. member for Aylesbury. The purpose of the regulations is to give further effect in Great Britain to the requirements of the two EU directives. We have considered with great care how they operate and we are satisfied that the legislative overlap, insofar as it exists, will not cause confusion. As I have already said, the guidance that we shall provide to employers will ensure that it can be dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. member for Aylesbury also asked about our views on the need for a new fire safety Act. He and I are agreed that it is important to solve the problems caused by fragmented fire legislation, and the Government are committed to bringing forward a fire safety Bill as soon as parliamentary time allows. Such a Bill has been sought for some time by fire authorities and fire services. We, too, are anxious that there should be one, but I cannot give the hon. Gentleman a commitment—he would not expect it of me—about what will be mentioned in the Queen's Speech, nor would he expect me to say when we shall introduce one. However, we share the hon. Gentleman's concern that such fragmented legislation should be dealt with and we are looking for a suitable opportunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. St. Aubyn) asked about ships. Those workplaces listed in regulation 3 (5) (e) of the 1997 regulations as amended by regulation 5 of the 1999 regulations, at new subparagraph (e), that remain exempt from the application of part II of the regulations are ships other than those in the course of construction or repair, unless such repair work is carried out on the ship solely by the master and crew of the ship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Defining "ship" in accordance with section 313(1) of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 also narrows the scope of that exception. The exception, in its amended form, remains because fire protection and fire-fighting on ships are covered by legislation that is based largely on international convention, in particular the safety of life at sea convention, the standards of training, certification and watchkeeping convention and other relevant regulations that appear to deal adequately with the needs and requirements. We, therefore, do not need to cover it in the new regulations. Although our legal advice suggests that to comply fully with the directives in some areas we need to extend the regulatory cover, we are advised that we do not need to extend the regulations in that respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For a brief, memorable time, I served in the Merchant Navy. I question what the Minister says. If I am right, he is saying that when work is carried out by the master and crew of a ship at sea, they are not covered by the regulations. My brief experience was as a member of a ship's company—I am not sure whether I was a member of the crew, as I spent most of my time carrying out repairs to the ship. Is the Minister saying that, in future, those who work their passage with the Merchant Navy cannot be involved in repairs as that would bring their work
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0294">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
within the context of the regulations, with which the shipmaster and crew are not otherwise concerned?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If a ship is outside our jurisdiction, it is covered by international conventions rather than domestic legislation. That is why I referred to the safety of life at sea convention and the standards of training, certification and watchkeeping convention. As the hon. Gentleman served in the Merchant Navy, I am sure that he has greater knowledge of those than me. I he wants to intervene again, I shall ask him for some details.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brady</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has opened an interesting aspect of the debate. Will the Minister elaborate a little on the interface between the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 and the regulations in respect of vessels that are moored but not necessarily for repair? The regulations refer to permanent mooring. Will they apply to permanently moored restaurant and night club ships? What would happen if a vessel, although typically moored for such purposes, were occasionally or regularly put to sea?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I trust that a permanently moored restaurant ship would come within the terms of the regulations. I am certain that we all want to ensure that the person running any restaurant moored on the Thames or elsewhere to which you or I go, Mr. Gale, complies with fire safety. I reassure the hon. Gentleman that the regulations would apply in such a case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can give the hon. Gentleman further reassurance. Paragraph (5) (e) of the amended regulations does not except permanently moored vessels such as floating restaurants or vessels permanently on dry land from the application of part II of the fire regulations. They are not ships in the meaning of section 313(1) of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995, because they do not operate as vessels on water. The hon. Gentleman will be much better informed if I refer to the prison ship HMP The Weare, which is a floating structure declared a prison under section 33(2) of the prisons Act 1952, as substituted by section 100(1) of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. If ships are moored or used on land, they are covered by the regulations. If they are in international waters, they are covered by international convention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brady</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will forgive me for intervening again, but the point is important. If the vessel is not always moored, when does the jurisdiction of the Merchant Shipping Act cease? Presumably it is not simply when the ship re-enters territorial waters, as that would apply in any case of a ship coming into port. If a ship is regularly moored as a night club or restaurant but also operates as a seagoing vessel, when does the changeover occur?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In practice the situation would not
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
work in that way. If a vessel were moored in the United Kingdom some of the time and work was carried out on it at that point, it would be covered by the regulations. If it went out of our jurisdiction into international waters, it would not cease to comply with regulations because they would have been complied with already. The employers would already have done what the regulations required them to do. In international waters, they may be subject to international convention and not to this legislation but, none the less, they will already have complied with it. When they bring their ships back into UK waters, they are already compliant—they have been throughout that period. The regulations do not impose burdens so onerous that the employer is subject to changes in the rules so that he is required to perform many and various tasks. The regulations can be complied with fairly easily and with the effort that I have already outlined. When the employer goes into international waters, he complies with international conventions; much the same requirements apply. I am not sure that the problem is as great as the hon. Gentleman thinks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brady</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know that it is a great problem but in examining the regulations, it is our responsibility to explore the situation. The Minister has dealt with the case of a vessel that has been moored and that has complied with the regulations and which then goes to sea. That situation does not necessarily accommodate the reverse one where a vessel has been at sea in international waters and then moors in a British port and operates as a nightclub or restaurant vessel. For what period would it have to be operating for it to be classed as permanently moored and come within the scope of the regulations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asks at what point somebody who wished to sail a ship into the United Kingdom, dock at a UK port and open as a restaurant would come within the terms of the regulations. That might happen, but if the restaurateur were intending to open that ship as a restaurant, he would be an employer in the UK as soon as he started to do so. I would, therefore, think that he would be subject to the regulations, but I shall consult our legal advisers and write to the hon. Gentleman to confirm at what point a person hoping to enter such a business enterprise would have to comply with the regulations. I am sure that it is an important point, although I suspect that it does not apply to many people. I am not aware of any such cases, but the hon. Gentleman is right that it is his job to test a Minister 	<i>[Interruption]</i> I am told that the answer lies in the definition of a ship.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is always interesting to explore the highways and byways of legislation, but I cannot help feeling that the good ship Red Herring may have sailed far enough. I hope that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. St. Aubyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a much wider point, regulation 15 on enforcement notices and offences states that it may be a proper defence for a person charged.
	<br><q><p>"to prove that he took all reasonable precautions and exercised all due diligence to avoid the commission of the offence."</p></q>
Will the Minister clarify the situation by confirming that where an employer has regularly invited inspection by the local fire officer and made every effort to comply with the fire officer's suggestions, he would have a good defence, even if both the employer and the fire officer may, regrettably, have overlooked some deficiency in the arrangements at the place of employment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The court will have to determine on a case by case bases, what constitutes a good defence within the law. If an employer has exercised proper and due diligence, complied with all the requirements for an inspection, been able to show that he has done what has been required by those who carry out
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
inspections, that will be a material fact that any court would have to consider in deciding whether there had been a breach of the criminal law. Given the way in which the regulations are set out, requiring merely due diligence, it is difficult to see that a good defence would not exist. However, I again qualify that by saying that it is in all cases a matter for the courts to determine what the law states and for us to set out what we believe to be the import of the legislation. On the broad facts of the case set out by the hon. Gentleman, it seems that there would be a very good defence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
