	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the first time that I have had the pleasure of being a member of a Standing Committee under your chairmanship, Mrs. Michie, and I hope that there will be many more such occasions. It is a pleasure to see you here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Value Added Tax (Sport, Sports Competitions and Physical Education) Order 1999 (S.I. 1999, No. 1994).</p></blockquote>
The order puts a stop to tax avoidance by commercially driven sports clubs, while fully safeguarding the position of genuine non-profit-making clubs. The avoidance exploits a difference in the VAT treatment of the two sorts of sports clubs, which derives from European law and to which hon. Members may wish to return when discussing the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until 1994, the United Kingdom treated all subscriptions to sports clubs as taxable at the standard rate but, in response to a legal challenge by the Central Council of Physical Recreation, the previous Government agreed that EC law was being wrongly applied and introduced an exemption for subscriptions to not-for-profit members' clubs. Since then, some profit-making clubs—notably golf clubs—have contrived schemes to avoid having to charge VAT by setting up non-profit-making clubs within the club, which they control and from which they extract profits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may have come to the notice of members of the Committee that we attempted to tackle that avoidance in an earlier order laid at Budget time last year that followed the Government's anti-avoidance procedure. I must be honest with the Committee and say that we did not apply the order because we realised that it would have had an accidentally adverse effect on genuinely not-for-profit clubs, which would not have been acceptable. Since then, we have spent a long time talking to affected parties to ensure that the wording of the provision is precise and correct. The resulting order has taken some time to draw up because, following correspondence from hon. Members about their golf clubs or golf clubs in their constituencies, I thought it right to make every effort to ensure that the order is correct, so extensive consultation was undertaken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order sets new conditions for exemption, which will take effect from 1 January 2000. To be exempt, a club must not distribute its profits except to another non-profit-making body or to its members on winding-up and it must not be subject to commercial influence in a way that permits the extraction of profits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
When drafting the order, Customs and Excise took full account of the concerns of sports governing bodies and of the need to protect the competitive position of commercial clubs that account properly for VAT. The order is complex, mainly because of the complexity of the avoidance schemes and our desire to ensure that we close current and future loopholes to prevent abuse of the measure that safeguards the exemption of non-profit-making clubs. As I have said, that has taken some time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. A. J. Beith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Berwick-upon-Tweed)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does commercial influence extend to the reasonable rent of land and facilities for the purpose of playing golf?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the order, commercial influence refers to an officer of the club, or someone associated with him or her, who is paid a profit-related salary or leases sports land to the club at a greater than nominal rent, or supplies managerial and administrative services to the club, or makes other supplies to the club at above the open market value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under pressure from me, Customs and Excise has taken great pains to ensure that guidance given to clubs on interpreting the exemptions is correct. Customs and Excise has stated that, in normal circumstances, it will treat any payment of less than £1,000 as nominal. The right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) will agree that we have made considerable efforts to assist in this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should remind the Committee that the order seeks to return the law to its 1994 form, as the previous Government intended and legislated to do. The law existed in that form until the appearance of avoidance schemes, of which Customs and Excise became aware in 1996.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am satisfied that the order will prevent tax avoidance and that non-profit-making clubs will be protected, but there is no disguising the fact that there will be losers. The losers will be those clubs that have used tax avoidance schemes, and they will be prevented from doing so. I readily acknowledge that many commercial golf clubs feel that they suffer unfair competition from local private members' clubs, many of which are large-scale organisations. We treat those concerns seriously, but the provisions in European law that allow us to counteract distortions are not straightforward. Customs and Excise is currently discussing those distortions with the European Commission. It is also working closely with the commercial golf club sector to define the problem in relation to the Commission and the sixth VAT directive, and explore possible solutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no reason to hold back on tackling avoidance, which currently undermines the position of legitimate commercial clubs. The measures in the order are a sensible and well-targeted response, and have been discussed fully with trade interests. I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.39 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Letwin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should begin with a word of sympathy for the Paymaster General who, when this ghastly saga began, was Financial Secretary.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0169">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
One might have thought that, on being promoted to her present, elevated position, she would have shed this horrible portfolio, but for some reason it has stuck to her. Most unfortunately for her, she now has to deal with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman has heard of the term "sticking VAT". He has given a new application to the meaning of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I prophesy that unless the Paymaster General is promoted, as we hope, to an even grander position in the near future, she will still be dealing with this issue in two, three or more years' time—if the present Government by some mischance remain in power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is not of the Government's making. It is due to the sixth VAT directive, which I hold in the greatest possible disesteem. Article 13 of the directive states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Without prejudice to other Community provisions, Member States shall exempt the following".</p></blockquote>
If the article stated that member states "may exempt the following", the problems that have been faced by the Paymaster General and her predecessors would not have arisen. I cannot understand the ludicrous conception that the European Union must determine which countries shall be exempt from VAT. I was delighted to hear that the Paymaster General's officials are talking to the Commission about it. I hope that in due course they will succeed in eliciting some movement on the matter or, if not, that Her Majesty's Government will start fighting the cause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 13 provides that something shall be exempted. Unfortunately, that something is subsequently hopelessly misdefined as
	<br><blockquote><p>"certain services closely linked to sport or physical education supplied by non-profit-making organizations to persons taking part in sport or physical education".</p></blockquote>
The problem with the article is not only that it inserts "shall" where there should be "may", but that the thing that is to be exempted is not merely a function, but a function that is carried out by a particular type of body. That mistake can have arisen only from a failure by those who drafted the article to engage in the slightest amount of economic literacy training, it clearly creates the basis for a distortion of competition, which is what has happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assume that the structure of the sixth VAT directive and its treaty base in relation to the single market are intended to permit open competition, not to distort competition. A provision that forces an exemption in respect of a part of the industry that is structured in a certain way—in this case, non-profit-making—and by implication prevents the exemption of another part of the same industry, which is directly competing and profit-making, will intensify the distortion of competition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order will do nothing to cure the root of the problem, and we have to yet to discover whether the Government will succeed in persuading the Commission to assist in curing it. If nothing is done, the Paymaster General will be back among us with further orders in the not-too-distant future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
The Paymaster General confidently announced that the order, which could be described as third time lucky, will prevent the tax avoidance mechanisms that it is designed to prevent—as were its late and unlamented predecessors. I doubt that it will do so. The distinguished presence on the Liberal Benches, the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed, drew attention to one of the areas that will cause trouble, and there will be others. Expert tax lawyers—I shall not name them—have told us that once the order is passed they will find a means of recreating avoidance mechanisms that will keep the Paymaster General happily occupied for some years to come. I suspect that, however ingenious she and her officials or their successors are, there will never be a solution to this problem so long as the badly structured European Union arrangements remain in place. That is because where there is a distortion of competition, there is a great incentive to try to devise mechanisms to overcome it. The private sector has far greater resources at its disposal to circumvent the ingenuities of the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise than either of those bodies can ever muster to prevent that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following the hon. Gentleman's points carefully. I want to make sure that, following his consultations with those who have already declared that they want to avoid the intent of Parliament in this order, he does not condone the actions of those who seek to avoid the legitimate tax that Parliament, through VAT legislation, has decided should be levied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a separate point from the one about the possible shortcomings of article 13A, which I would be happy to discuss with the hon. Gentleman. However, I would not want him to give the impression that he is condoning tax avoidance, and I sincerely hope that he is not doing so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While we all deplore any illegal evasion of tax, it is not the business of the Government or the Opposition to deplore or to welcome any legal scheme that enables people to go about their business. That is the structure of our legal system in relation to tax: the law is set out, and it is then open to private individuals to hire experts to make the best use of that legislation, within the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, we deplore anything that is not done within the law, but Parliament must either remain neutral or legislate on anything that is done within the law. If the Paymaster General wishes to solve the problem when it next arises, she will do that by legislation. That is why I fear that she will have to return to us on this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that this is not a change of Conservative party policy. I should inform the hon. Gentleman that there is a world of difference between using tax law in order to plan one's affairs and actively seeking out ways of frustrating the intent of Parliament. Will the hon. Gentleman clarify whether Her Majesty's Opposition are in favour of avoidance because it is legal, and whether it is only evasion that they are against?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am neither in favour of avoidance nor against it. Neither is the Paymaster General, because the Government always have the power at their disposal to prosecute, and they quite properly prosecute always and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0170">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
only cases of evasion while maintaining neutrality on the subject of legitimate avoidance. They legislate if they believe that avoidance is occurring in a way that is detrimental to the national interest. I repeat that the Paymaster General will end up having to legislate again and again. However, I do not want to dwell on that point too much—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very wise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to dwell on the matter further, but I do not want to bore the Committee with it because the position is quite clear, and it is one that the Paymaster General and her colleagues, in and out of government, have always adopted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Heald 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Hertfordshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not it ill behove the Paymaster General to make the sort of remarks that she has, when she has already admitted that, owing to an accident in the drafting of the previous order, she has not been able to implement it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is absolutely right. Moreover, it has taken almost two years for the Paymaster General's extremely intelligent and knowledgeable advisers to come up with this attempt. I hope that it succeeds, given the limits imposed by article 13. I merely want to enter the note of caution that I do not think that it will.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The distortion of competition in the industry is a much deeper problem. Given that the order does nothing to remedy that problem—and, as far as I can see, could not do so under the structure of EU legislation—what will the Paymaster General do to remedy it? How will she deal with the situation, which has no doubt been brought to her attention by constituents—as it has to mine and, I suspect, to that of every other Member of Parliament—whereby two ostensibly similar clubs, which are next door to each other, find that they are not on a level playing field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As this is a revenue-raising measure, it is odd that the Paymaster General has said nothing about how much revenue it will raise. The Opposition have repeatedly noted that the Government have been particularly adept at raising revenue through the largest programme of stealth tax in the history of this country. Some taxes are not very stealthy, some are quite stealthy and some are very stealthy. Avoidance-closing mechanisms come in the last category. It would therefore be interesting to know how much the order will add to the £40 billion stealth tax bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The opacity of the Red Book is of the greatest concern, although not, I regret to say, to the Paymaster General's colleague, the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I dignify it by calling it opaque; it is completely incomprehensible. Will the next Red Book show the item under discussion as a revenue-increasing measure? That would help us to spot it in the welter of confusing statistics, and would assure us that revenue raised by a very stealthy tax is at least entered somewhere in the Red Book, even if it cannot be found.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, the Opposition do not benefit from the profound legal advice available to Her Majesty's Government. That is sometimes an advantage—as in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
case of dealings with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food—but in this case it is a disadvantage. What advice has the Paymaster General received about the compatibility of the order with the sixth VAT directive? It was partly the possible incompatibility of that directive with the previous orders—which I do not think the Paymaster General mentioned—that led to the failure of those attempts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Paymaster General has kindly told the Committee that her officials are in discussions with the Commission, which the Opposition welcome. What is the progress and remit of those discussions, and what sort of people are engaged in them? Furthermore, what does the Paymaster General hope to achieve from those discussions? The Paymaster General is not merely another Minister; she has been chairing the most dangerous committee in the EU—the committee dealing with tax harmonisation. I should not call it the most dangerous; it is one of the most dangerous. She has repeatedly assured the House—she has assured me across the Floor of the House—that it will cause no harm to the UK. We hope that that will turn out to be true, although we remain highly doubtful. She is now engaged in an endeavour of which we wholly approve—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Makes a change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed it does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be nice to know how the matter is being conducted. Will the Paymaster General attend in particular to the difference between an effort by her officials to do her bidding in relation to article 13—in that context, we would have some confidence that she and they were trying to achieve the right result—and the diplomatic trading that might occur if UKREP—the United Kingdom permanent representation in Brussels—were involved? Once the UKREP gets in on the act, we have learnt to be diffident about the prospects of successful change in relation to EU provisions, especially under the aegis of this Labour Government. There is a fear that whatever is sought will be traded off against something else that someone else wants in return for another favour—a great daisy chain of diplomatic favours may be involved. It would be nice to know who is conducting the relevant effort.

Why did this splendid Damascene conversion occur so late? The Paymaster General has been working with her officials on this matter for more than two years and she will have come across the problems that are associated with article 13 at an early stage in her investigations. Why was the Commission not first approached two years ago? Had it been approached successfully, we might have been spared this prolonged effort, which involves the production of orders, and this very debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall conclude with some detailed questions for the Paymaster General. We understand that she did not meet the Association of Golf Club owners during the consultation period. Is that correct? Did she meet any groups other than those that were named in her written answer of 27 April?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Paymaster General recognise the anomaly that is faced by so-called artisans' golf clubs? Will it be countered by the order and, if so, how?

Has the Paymaster General undertaken, or does she intend to undertake, a general review of the effects of taxation on the golf club industry in the United Kingdom?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.57 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kingston and Surbiton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a particular pleasure to welcome you to the Chair, Mrs. Michie. I look forward to sitting on many of the other Committees that you will chair. I am sure that you are paying great attention to the order, because it relates to golf, which is dear to the hearts of your constituents and to the country in which your constituency resides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we discuss VAT orders such as this one, I am reminded of game theory, which I had the pleasure of studying at university. It involves the theory of analysis and decision making, and the creation of decision trees from which one can choose different options, which may be win or lose options. The decision tree in relation to this problem ends up in lose, lose or lose outcomes. The Government faced three lose options in relation to the sixth VAT directive and article 13, and they had no choice but to go down the road that they did. Despite the long speech of the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin), he did not really challenge the Government's decision to go down their chosen route.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The option that would have been most politically attractive to the Government, and which would have received applause throughout the golfing industry, is supported by proprietary golf clubs and, I believe, by the English Golf Union. That involves applying the VAT exemptions to all golf clubs, which would level the playing field and remove the problems that are associated with competition. There would have been slightly higher costs to the Treasury—I am sure that some officials would pale at that prospect—but we could all have signed up to that solution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wholly endorse the hon. Gentleman's general perception, but is it compatible with the regulations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman anticipates what I am about to say. It would almost certainly be illegal. EU case law arising from the kingdom of Spain case last year suggests that that is how the courts would interpret article 13A(1)(m) of the sixth directive, so that option does not seem to be open.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other option, which was supported by the Conservative Government until 1994, is to give no one an exemption. That would assist competition and the cost would be low, but it became clear after the 18th VAT directive in 1989 that that would no longer be possible and would not be defendable in court. The European Commission criticised the position that the then Government were trying to uphold. Various sports associations lobbied for an exemption for the non-profit-making sector and Customs and Excise received legal opinion suggesting that it continued to uphold that position, it would have to defend it case by case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree with me—and, from the look on her face when I was speaking, the Paymaster General—that it is unfortunate that article 13 brings about the situation that he is describing and prevents the UK Government from exempting everyone and, indeed, from imposing on everyone?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is tempting me to say that we should review the directive, I am happy to accept the temptation. Directives, including the sixth directive which lies behind the subsequent directives, are continually examined and I hope that the Government will give a pledge to the Committee that they will raise the issues during their discussions with the Commission—both those to which the Paymaster General referred and any subsequent discussions on wider VAT reform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened with great attention to the hon. Gentleman because I was wondering if he would take the line of his leader and suggest that we should opt out and break the law. The Conservative party is descending to the level of anarchists in not wishing to uphold other aspects of European law. I was delighted that the hon. Gentleman did not go down that path.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the hon. Gentleman talking about?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman took the bait. I would have thought that he listened to his leader speaking on Radio 4's "Today" programme when he suggested that EU laws on beef and food—you look as though you are about to rule me out of order, Mrs. Michie.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crispin Blunt 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Reigate)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Article 36 of the treaty is the legal justification for the Leader of the Opposition's position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is contestable, but I do not want to enter that contest because you would certainly rule me out of order, Mrs. Michie.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The idea that we could exempt no one has been rejected. The Conservative Government rejected it back in 1994 and no one is proposing to follow that route. We are left with the unsatisfactory third option, which is a lose option in the terminology of game theory and is to exempt only non-profit-making sports associations. That is the legal position and the Government are right to try to uphold that, but I hope that they will try to support all golf clubs, especially proprietary golf clubs, against which the law discriminates. I hope that the Government will review article 13.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee's job is to decide whether the order does what it purports to do. In the light of advice that we have received, it probably does. That is not surprising, given that five attempts have been made to get it right: one by the previous Government and, in effect, three prior to today's order. One would hope that, by the fifth attempt, we are near to getting it right. However, is the Paymaster General sure that the definition "subject to commercial influence" will not be open to challenge in the courts? The hon. Member for West Dorset touched
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0172">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
on that issue. My right hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed also alluded to it, and I am sure that he intends to explain in greater detail his worries about what is a fairly vague term. In answering my right hon. Friend's point, the Paymaster General suggested that there are detailed guidelines on how the provision will be implemented. Nevertheless, as the hon. Member for West Dorset said, such legal definitions can be subject to challenge. I hope that the Paymaster General can reassure the Committee that, this time, we have got it about right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem of unfairness in respect of proprietary golf clubs should be taken seriously. We in the House must uphold the law and do what we can to make it fairer, but when a problem cannot be resolved, we should look for innovative and creative solutions—second best solutions, perhaps—to ensure that competition is upheld and people are treated fairly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad to hear that the Paymaster General's officials are discussing the needs of proprietary golf clubs with the Commission, and I endorse many of the questions, which I hope she will answer today, that were raised by the hon. Member for West Dorset in respect of those discussions. I have a further question, about the time scale. In Committee, we are often told that Government officials and Commission officials are holding discussions, and I have come to suspect that that is the long grass, "We hope it'll go away" answer. I hope that we will be given a time scale and a commitment that Ministers will report to Parliament on those discussions. There may be no procedural framework for such a report, but we should be grateful for a commitment from Ministers to which they could be held. I am sure that the Paymaster General would agree that that is the proper, democratic approach to such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to helping proprietary golf club owners and potential owners, I wonder whether specific, grant-based support could be provided for new golf clubs. New golf clubs are being discriminated against, but it is they who are feeding the growth of golf in this country. The future of golf depends on the setting up of new clubs and the building of new courses. The entrepreneurs who want to invest private capital in such ventures are trying to fulfil a great social need and meet the market demand for more clubs. Prima facie, we should support that sector of the industry, particularly given that it is likely to serve the many, not the few, by providing clubs that people from lower and middle income groups can join without the requirement of an old school tie. I mean no disrespect to the older members'clubs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter is important and I hope that the Paymaster General will take it seriously. This part of the golf industry needs some assistance if it has to be discriminated against by the legal framework that is to be upheld in this case. Whether that assistance is provided by grants from the Sports Council or some other mechanism, I hope that the Paymaster General will consider some of those second best solutions to try to ensure the promotion of golfing as a sport in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
My final point relates to the Government's overall approach to VAT. Members of the Committee have expressed concern that there is insufficient flexibility for member States in the operation of VAT law and I gather, from debates in previous Committees, that that view is shared by both Government and Opposition Members. Under the former commissioner for the single market, Mario Monti, the Commission put forward a proposal to give member states an option to reduce VAT in certain areas—a specific submission to the Commission concerned employment-generating industries—so that a member state could opt for a much lower rate of VAT for certain services. It is a shame that the Government did not take that opportunity—in fact, they resisted it. To be fair to the Paymaster General, the Government did not veto the proposal at ECOFIN, but they gave it no support and did not take up the option in respect of the United Kingdom. The Government should be supporting that sort of development at Commission level, given the problems of inflexibility in VAT law that we have heard about during today's debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although it would be out of order for the Paymaster General to comment specifically on the Commission's proposal, I hope that she appreciates Committee members' desire for the Government to support more flexible VAT laws and back the Commission when it makes such proposals rather than taking an ambivalent and neutral approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Proprietary golf clubs need the support of the House because, as the Committee must acknowledge, VAT law discriminates against them. I hope that the Minister will admit that to the Committee and explain how she proposes to deliver more support to golf clubs and proprietary golf entrepreneurs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.12 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to have the opportunity briefly to address the Committee about proprietary golf courses, and grateful for the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey). The VAT issue has been in the bunker for some time and, having looked at the complexities of the order, I am not sure whether the Government are going to manage to play it onto the green.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unreasonable to refer to many of the people who will be affected by the order as if they were engaged in the kind of systematic tax avoidance that one associates with some of the sharper operators in the city. They are currently doing the most to expand opportunities to play golf, and would like a level playing field. At one time, the big gap that was left in areas where there were not enough golf clubs was filled by municipal golf courses. I cannot imagine a local authority nowadays feeling able to embark on acquiring land and building a golf course or, if it did so, running it itself rather than creating a club structure—in which case it would have an exemption under the order. It is no longer local authorities that are filling the gap, but proprietary golf clubs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The traditional clubs had their privileges established in 1994. Given the particular value of those privileges—as Europe intended—I am sure that all members of the Committee would want to maintain
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0173">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
them. The way in which golf develops in the future, especially in areas of the country where land is expensive, depends on proprietors acquiring land and being prepared to create opportunities for golf clubs. Sometimes a person starts with a driving range and goes on to develop a course, or the course is ancillary to an hotel, a caravan site or another type of development. Some courses result from the Government's policy of encouraging diversification on agricultural land—where there is no further scope for farming an area of land, it may be turned into a golf course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some areas, it is difficult to get into a traditional golf club. That is not such a problem in my constituency—there are 13 golf courses within its boundary and five more within a few miles. Two proprietary golf clubs have been developed in my area, one of which—the Belford golf club—has raised its concerns with me. In many parts of the country, especially in the home counties, it is difficult to get into a golf club at all. As my hon. Friend the member for Kingston and Surbiton said, those on lower incomes who are taking up golf for the first time are probably using the proprietary clubs. That is their best chance of getting into golf.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should bear that in mind when considering this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Paymaster General should recognise that those who have helped to create additional golf opportunities have a real grievance. They were not engaged in tax avoidance; they simply felt that, in natural justice, those who played golf on their courses should not have to pay VAT if those at the traditional clubs did not have to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clubs that are not avoiding tax should not be affected. We are considering clubs that, for profit, have contrived schemes to protect their position and frustrate the law that says that VAT should be paid. The discussion of golf clubs and their position in the market has been interesting, but the Committee is considering avoidance. The law is clear on the payment of VAT on membership. We want to return to the legal position in 1994; that is all. This is not a panacea for golf clubs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The law is not clear; otherwise, we would not be debating this extremely complicated set of provisions. A club does not have to be run for profit to be affected by the provisions. An extremely complex range of factors can be brought into play to demonstrate that what an ordinary golfer thinks is merely a golf club is under some kind of commercial influence. That is why I asked the Paymaster General about the rent of land, for example. She and her officials may be trying to implement the directive effectively but there is no benefit in ascribing an improper motivation to people who are simply expanding opportunities for people to play golf.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, the law must be sorted out so that it means what it is intended to mean. However, the Paymaster General must understand why people feel it is unreasonable that there is not a level playing field, or level golf course, when their circumstances do not differ significantly from those of a club up the road that happens to have acquired the use of the land for historic reasons, without commercial factors being considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On consultation, all of the comments on the order were taken into consideration, and the Government's position was accepted. Those whom we consulted also wanted us to deal with the issue of distortion—which is beyond the scope of the order—as a result of the directive. The Government are attempting to deal with it, and I shall explain why when I reply to the debate. As the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton said, it is accepted—even if it is not liked—that that is how to deal with the tax issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am asking the Paymaster General to understand the difficulties of the clubs involved. She misunderstands the creation of clubs in proprietary golf courses. The motive for the creation of a club does not have to be tax avoidance; it is to allow people to engage in competitive golf and to have handicaps. It is also more sensible for those who play the course to take charge of running it. Access to such clubs is usually easier than to the heavily oversubscribed traditional clubs, which usually have waiting lists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most municipal courses these days have a golf club running the course. That is not a tax avoidance device. It is simply the normal procedure if one has a golf course and one wants to give those who play there the opportunity to take part in the full range of golf activities and to be represented at higher levels within the sport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is there a hidden danger to traditional gold clubs in the order? Could they be affected by it? I seek some assurance on that point. Many traditional members' golf clubs do not own their land and have enjoyed nominal rents for many years, but the landowners may decide to increase the rents when the leases come up for renewal. Landed estates are becoming more commercial—they say that they have to. Arguments have arisen between golf clubs and landed estates about what the rent should be in the future. The fact that the sixth or seventh duke was interested in golf and offered a nominal rent does not necessarily mean that the ninth or 10th duke will do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, if the private landowner who granted the land in the first place no longer owns it, and it is now owned by a large commercial enterprise, a more commercial rent may be sought. Does that mean that a traditional members' club may suddenly have to charge VAT to its members, because the rent is no longer nominal? The problem may not be confined to land—there may be buildings involved as well. Historically, a landowner may have helped to get the golf club started, and even put up the original buildings. The ownership structures of many traditional golf clubs are often quite complicated. I do not know of many clubs in my area that own their land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned the figure of £1,000. That would certainly be a very nominal rent indeed for a golf course comprising several acres and a number of buildings, if an estate was seeking a reasonable return from that land. Will she recognise that, although she may be carrying out her duties correctly, the people with whom she is dealing are, in many cases, those who saw the need for fair treatment for those who play golf on those courses? Therefore, among the complexities of the order, we may now find hidden dangers for the traditional members' golf clubs that do not own their land or buildings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.22 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to deal with all the points that have been raised. However, I want to make some brief opening comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much of our discussion has covered the structure of golf clubs and the means of ensuring that they thrive in their many different manifestations. Some members of the Committee sought to make wider points about golf clubs and their status. As I mentioned to the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed, Customs and Excise saw in this sector the development of schemes that had been contrived in order to reduce tax liability. The order seeks to ensure that the law makes clear those liabilities, and the difference for non-profit-making clubs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Dorset made many points regarding article 13A and the discussions taking place between the Government and the Commission, as did the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton, who referred to the kingdom of Spain case. I shall deal with those points in a moment. As the hon. Member for West Dorset knows, the directive was agreed by all member states. The list of exemptions mainly comprises reliefs granted for social reasons and they are listed as exemptions "in the public interest". I referred earlier to the problems of distortion and of wording, which the hon. Member for West Dorset discussed at some length. I shall return to those matters—we might call them the European points—later, but first I want to discuss the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Dorset said that he had been told that there already were ingenious ways round the order's provisions. I am happy to listen to his further comments in that regard. If he or others know of loopholes in the order, we should deal with them. I urge him not to wait but to tell us about them now. If a Member of Parliament, especially a member of Her Majesty's Opposition, knows of the way in which legislation can be frustrated, he or she should tell us about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I had the slightest knowledge of what those methods were, I should certainly tell the Paymaster General about them. I should be delighted if people were that open. I am sure that she agrees that our problem is that there is a big world out there, in which many highly paid people do not disclose such matters to Members of Parliament—they wait until legislation is enacted and earn fees by disclosing loopholes to clients. That is the whole problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed. We know only too well how ingenious such advisers can be in relation to the tax system. It is the lot of this Government, as it was the lot of the previous Government, to try to frustrate such action. If a club meets the order's conditions, it can expect to benefit from the exemption. The order is designed to catch all the artificial schemes of which we are aware and all of those that, with our best endeavours, we can dream up. The hon. Member for West Dorset asked me to give an absolute guarantee that there would be no way round the order's provisions. Earlier, he
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
discussed people who are absolutely determined to frustrate Parliament and to avoid paying the taxes that it establishes. I cannot put my hand on my heart and say that such people will never succeed, although I should love to be able to do so, but we have done our very best to prevent their success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked whether the Financial Statement and Budget Report would be scored. Yes, it will be—the relevant provision is contained in the interim FSBR. He also asked about the figures. The revenue that we shall cease to lose is £5 million, and we believed that £15 million was at risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That returns us to our debate about whether the Government should turn a blind eye to avoidance schemes in the tax system. Irrespective of the previous Government's attitude, we have always made it clear that we shall act to prevent avoidance, which is unfair to those taxpayers who comply with the law—they expect us to ensure that the tax system operates fairly. We do so in this context and across the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about compatibility with the sixth directive. We drew up the order in close consultation with Customs solicitors and parliamentary counsel to ensure that it was compatible with the sixth directive. He also asked which bodies were consulted. We consulted the Central Council of Physical Recreation, the English Golf Union, the National Golf Clubs Advisory Association, the Sports and Recreation Trusts Association, the Chartered Institute of Taxation, the Association of Golf Course Owners and Business in Sport and Leisure. Many of those bodies also met Customs officials.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about the treatment of artisans' golf clubs. If they are members of a club, their subscriptions will be exempt if artisans are not granted membership, they are treated as visitors and their playing fees are subject to VAT. If that answer does not satisfy the hon. Gentleman, I shall be happy for him to pursue the matter with me in writing and I shall make a suggestion at the end of my comments on how we might proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference was made to a level playing field or golf course—I know nothing about golf, but I thought that courses were not meant to be level. I assure the Committee that the Government understand the problem of distortion, but I hope that I have made it clear that it does not follow that we shall not deal with avoidance. Customs and Excise is actively exploring with the Commission the difficulties caused by the VAT directive and had a meeting recently with the Association of Golf Club Owners. I understand that the association, assisted by Customs and Excise, is trying to talk to the Commission about modernising the directive. The association has carried out research on the taxation of golf clubs, as members of the Committee are aware. The paper details the difficulties faced by commercial golf clubs and has been sent to every Member of Parliament. Customs officials have discussed the matter, particularly the VAT issues, and the association will seek legal advice and make representations, with the English Golf Union, to the commission.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0175">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
It may be helpful if I turn to the European dimension. The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton referred to the kingdom of Spain case and the hon. Member for West Dorset asked why so long. The central issue is what is in the directive and we received the decision of the European Court of Justice on 7 May. Customs had hoped for clarification of the case-by-case line taken by the Commission and to which the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton referred, but there was none. The case clearly features in the discussions between Customs and Excise and the Commission on how to explore the scope for resolving distortions. We shall do that jointly with the Association of Golf Club Secretaries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I finish my comments, because I shall make a helpful suggestion at the end, which may satisfy hon. Members?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Negotiations were led by senior officials of Customs and Excise. Our objective is to reduce the distortion caused by the current VAT treatment and the difference between commercial and non-profit-making clubs. We have also had discussions with other member states and know of at least two who are prepared to support our argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of distortion is separate from the order but, instead of providing a meaningless time scale, I am prepared to keep the hon. Members for West Dorset and for Kingston and Surbiton informed as our discussions proceed. They will accept that there are more important matters on the Government's agenda—we are not bargaining or trading in our discussions in Europe—and we have a lot of work on at present. However, if I undertake to keep the hon. Gentlemen informed, I believe that that will go some way towards showing that we are taking the question of distortion seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
I think that I have answered most of the questions put by the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed. He asked whether the order presented a danger to traditional golf clubs. Clubs will be caught only if a lease of land is varied or renewed after 1 April 1996, and only if the owner of the land is an officer of the club and exerts commercial influence over it. When land is leased for a nominal amount to a club, that will not be affected by the exemption. However, if the right hon. Gentleman is in agreement, I should like to check the record from today's proceedings and to write to him on that point, as it is an important issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my offer to Opposition Members to keep their two spokespersons informed as we proceed with the measure will help us to deal with any unresolved matters arising not from the order itself but from the question of distortion. It should also help to deal with any issues that subsequently arise from the order. I sincerely hope that there will not be any, although I am not in a position to guarantee that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have now dealt with all the questions raised. I will, of course, check the record and, should there be any that I have not answered as fully as I could have done, I will write to the Members concerned. I think that I have covered the area quite comprehensively, and I hope that the Committee will now agree to the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
