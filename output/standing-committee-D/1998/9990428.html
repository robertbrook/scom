	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Theresa May 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Maidenhead)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Code of Practice on School Admissions.</p></blockquote>
I welcome you, Mr. Atkinson, as Chairman of the Committee. This is the first time that I have had the opportunity of serving under you, which I am sure will be a pleasure for me and for other Committee members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already considered in Standing Committee several regulations that underlie the code of practice. In Standing Committee, I told the Minister for School Standards that I hoped that we should have an opportunity to examine the code. When people assess the Government's admissions policies, they will read the code rather than the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to school admissions, I agree that parents need to have information that is clear and easily comprehensible. I am sure that Committee members—especially those who serve on the Select Committee on Education and Employment—know that particular problems occur when parents cannot get their children into their school of preference. I accept that it is difficult to design admissions policies that are genuinely fair and which people believe operate in the interests of local children. It is not easy to take action in this area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to make clear information available to parents. However, in this context, I am not sure that such information is particularly clear to them. To fully comprehend the issues, they should read the code of practice, the code on admissions appeals—a draft of which the Government recently issued—the Education (Relevant Areas for Consultation on Admission Arrangements) Regulations 1999, the Education (Objections to Admission Arrangements in England) Regulations 1999—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The Government Whip yawns, but it is the Government who oblige parents to examine these regulations, which I am sure are seared on his heart.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other documents that parents should read: the Education (Infant Class Sizes) (Transitional Provisions) Regulations 1998, the Education (Grammar School Ballots) Regulations 1998, the Education (Aptitude for Prescribed Subjects) Regulations 1998 and the Education (School Information) Regulations 1998. If parents are going to do a thorough job in relation to the code, they should also read the Disability Discrimination Act 1995.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The admissions practice that is contained in the code is clearly underpinned by a complex series of regulations. I have several specific questions about the
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
code. The Minister will not be surprised to learn that I want to discuss the fact that, in relation to admissions policies, the code refers to the issues of no selection and no interviews in schools, except in a restricted framework, and it raises the question of aptitude versus ability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall begin with the question of selection. As we know, grammar schools are under threat in so far as the Government have given parents the opportunity to ballot against the retention of selective education in an area or for a particular grammar school in an area. On page 27 in paragraph A.58, the code states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The new admissions framework applies to grammar schools. Their selective admission arrangements will not be affected for school intakes before September 2001 by the 1998 Act."</p></blockquote>
It goes on to refer to the Education (Grammar School Ballots) Regulations 1998. I assume that that reference is intended to indicate that that is the first stage at which it would be possible for parents to decide to abolish grammar schools in their area. I would like the Minister to confirm that statement, because it could be interpreted as implying that after 2001 the Government have other intentions for grammar schools. It is important that the Minister clarifies the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Partial selection is also referred to in the code of practice. Some members of the Committee sat through long hours on the Standing Committee that considered the School Standards and Framework Bill—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Bravely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. May</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, and the Committee did a very good job of raising issues and holding the Government to account. One issue on which we scrutinised the Government was partial selection and there were different views on the subject in the Committee. It is interesting that the Government are allowing a decision on whether partial selection can continue to be made not by the local education authority or the Secretary of State, but by the new adjudicator who will oversee school organisation proposals and admission arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people would question why as few as 10 parents will be able to refer a complaint about partial selection to an outside person—the adjudicator—who may know nothing about the local area. During the Standing Committee on the School Standards and Framework Bill the Minister for School Standards said that the adjudicator would probably not know about the local area and that it would be better if he did not. The adjudicator will be appointed by the Government and will be able to make a decision on the basis of a complaint from just 10 parents. The adjudicator can do away with partial selection in a school, notwithstanding the fact that it may be preferred by the majority of parents whose children attend the school or are likely to attend it. That is a step in the wrong direction, both in terms of the Government's attack on partial selection and the adjudicator's powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The adjudicator has duties beyond partial selection. He is able to look at disputes between authorities over admissions and can make decisions on those disputes.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0498">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Again, here is someone who comes in from outside and sits in judgment on what is happening in the area, perhaps with no knowledge of the local area. He is not elected, but is appointed by the Government to take decisions on what is right for children in the area over and above decisions taken by schools and the local education authority as the admissions authority. We are worried about the role of the adjudicator in relation to school admissions and organisation plans. We are concerned about the way in which he will be parachuted in, having been appointed by the Secretary of State, to undertake the various functions that I have outlined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred earlier to interviews. There was much debate about that in the Standing Committee that considered the School Standards and Framework Bill and it remains a matter of concern. It was referred to in paragraph 5.25 of the code of practice. I understand—perhaps the Minister will confirm this—that the only interview that any school can hold with parents concerning the suitability of their children to attend the school is to determine whether they are of a particular religious or denominational commitment. Parents cannot be asked questions to determine whether they are committed to the ethos of the school or any other arrangements set out in the home-school agreement, which the Government now require every school to put in place. The school cannot require parents to abide by that home-school agreement in an interview or as a condition of admission to the school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The best example of the problem, which has been quoted on a number of occasions, is the London Oratory School, which the Prime Minister chose for two of his children to attend—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I assume that the Government Whip is tut-tutting at the Prime Minister's decision to send his children to a school that is not local but on the other side of London. Admission to the London Oratory, which is a Roman Catholic school, includes an interview process in which more is discussed than whether the parents are practising Roman Catholics. A description of that interview process, which was given in another place on 10 June 1998, stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The places available will be offered to the most suitable candidates and the decision will be made in the light of the following factors: whether the boy comes from a family in which the Catholic parent or parents are practising members of the Roman Catholic Church; acceptance by the parents and boy of the conditions under which the boys are admitted to and allowed to remain in the school; acceptance of firm discipline and the school regulations; commitment by the parents and by the boy to 11–18 schooling and an undertaking to remain at the school for the sixth form".—[	<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 10 June 1998; Vol. 590, c. 1112.]</p></blockquote>
I assume that those conditions were fairly applied to the Prime Minister, just as they are applied to any other parent who wants his children to attend the London Oratory. However, it is such conditions that the Government want to prevent schools from applying. The are taking away the power of schools to discover, through interview, whether parents and children will be compatible with their ethos. That will reduce the ability of schools such as the London Oratory to retain their distinctive ethos.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Claire Ward 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Watford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady should realise that the Government are not seeking to alter the discipline and standards that schools maintain. We want to stop schools deciding on the suitability of parents according to the image that they present and the argument that they advance, and using that information subsequently to discriminate against the child by failing to offer the best opportunities. It is not a question of altering the rules and standards in schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. May</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suggest that the hon. Lady looks at the case of the London Oratory. Its headmaster has stated publicly that he fears that his school's ethos will be changed if he is unable to conduct such interviews, which ensure that its clear behavioural rules and guidelines are supported by parents and adhered to by pupils. It is important for schools to be able to maintain such an ethos should they wish to do so, and to ensure that prospective pupils will support it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move on to a number of other issues relating to the code of practice. The question of infant classes in relation to admissions procedures has been debated long and hard, particularly given the Government's imposition of a class size limit of 30. However, a number of exceptions can be applied to that limit. I should be grateful if the Minister would clarify the question of standard numbers and admission numbers in relation to infant class sizes, because paragraph A.35 of the code of practice states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The legislation requires admission authorities to adjust standard and admission numbers so that they are compatible with the class size limit."</p></blockquote>
When we debated the exceptions to the class size limit, which are set out in regulations, the Minister answered a question from the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis) by giving a commitment that schools will be able to set admission numbers that are higher than the limit of 30. Will the Minister clarify the Government's position? The statement in paragraph A.35 that admission numbers must be
	<br><blockquote><p>"compatible with the class size limit"</p></blockquote>
could be interpreted in two ways. It could mean that admission numbers must be compatible with the limit of 30, or with the higher limit to which the Minister referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Exceptions to the class size limit are set out in the code of practice. However, paragraph A.36 states that, in certain cases,
	<br><blockquote><p>"the class may only be above 30 for the remainder of that school year."</p></blockquote>
I assume that that relates to those children in the categories of exceptions that have been set out. In the following year, there may be other children who fit into the category of having a statement of special needs, for example, which names that particular school when the child moves into the area, outside of the normal admissions round. The ability to exercise such exceptions must apply across years, although I assume that the one-year time limit applies to a particular child who is an exception to the class size limit of 30.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0499">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
I should also like to refer to the question of compulsory school age, as set out in paragraph A.56. Many hon. Members will have considerable difficulty with the dates that are set to determine when a child can enter school. The dates are 31 August, 31 December and 31 March. A number of concerns have been expressed to me on this matter, mainly by constituents whose children's birthdays are in early April. Such children miss the summer term and can only start in the autumn term. I recognise the difficulties of administration in that regard, but I wonder whether it might be possible to consider those deadlines again. I tabled a question on the matter, and the Government's answer was that they had decided on the three dates as a result of consultation. Parents have expressed a great deal of concern about the rigidity of the deadlines, especially those whose children miss the summer term and must wait, nothwithstanding that they may attend a nursery, until the autumn term before being categorised as of compulsory school age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first of my last two points relates to the issue of aptitude and ability. I will not indulge in a long discussion about the difference between aptitude and ability—we have had many such discussions in Committee Rooms in the past 18 months or so. It is noticeable, however, that the Government's code of practice—which is intended to clarify the position for parents—does not make it clear what aptitude is and how it can be tested. Paragraph 5.16 is one of the best examples of that. After a paragraph that deals with priority on grounds of aptitude and considering whether a pupil has an aptitude for a subject, the Government state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A test for aptitude must test for the subject aptitude concerned and not test for ability or any other aptitude."</p></blockquote>
That is as clear as mud. Yet again, the Government have caught themselves with their insistence on selecting on aptitude but not on ability. When does a child have an aptitude for a subject but not an ability for a subject? Paragraph 5.16 shows the difficulty that the Government have got themselves into with such an insistence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Ward</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady agree that there is a difference between a child's aptitude for sports, music or a language, and what is, in effect, an 11-plus system, where a child sits an exam on a Saturday morning in a whole range of subjects? The results of that exam will be the admissions criteria on which it is decided whether the child can attend school A or school B.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Willis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harrogate and Knaresborough)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not getting rid of that. We are keeping it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. May</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exactly. I suggest that the hon. Lady reads what is set out in the admissions code and in the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. Decisions on whether a child goes to school A or school B will be taken according to whether they happen to be good at a particular subject. Children are not supposed to be able across a range of subjects—
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
they can be good at maths and go to a specialist maths school, but they are not supposed to be good at maths and a foreign language together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real issue is how to test for aptitude and not ability. Paragraph 5.16 shows that the Government do not know how to do that. It is as clear as mud about what a test for aptitude is: effectively it states that a test for aptitude is a test for aptitude.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for School Standards (Ms Estelle Morris)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is true.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. May</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is indeed true, but it is so self-evident that we are surprised that the Government felt the need to put it in the code. Paragraph 5.16 does not explain anything to parents and others about what the test for aptitude will be about, and how it will be put in place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the debate on early-years education in the Chamber this morning, a point was raised about the reference in paragraph 5.10 of the code to the ability of a school to keep open a place for a child whose parents wished to defer entry to the school until the child came of school age. For example, a child might be offered a place in reception class but the parents might want the child to continue in nursery or pre-school provision, so the school would hold the place open.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To the extent that that will provide greater choice, put parents under less pressure to get children into reception classes and help to counter the current problem of children being encouraged to go into reception classes, and the consequent number of pre-schools that will have to close—there have been 1,500 in the past two years and there may be 1,700 this year—it will be welcome if it happens. However, schools have raised important questions with me relating to how they will operate that policy and how they can retain places when they are not receiving funding for children who otherwise would have been in them. I should be grateful if the Minister would address that when she winds up the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point relates to the cross-border use of parental preferences, an issue that I often hear about in my constituency. I suspect that the Minister will reply that admissions forums should help. However, concern has been voiced in areas where there are parents who wish to apply to a school within their local education authority and to another school in another LEA. Application for both schools will be made on a different form and although parents will name a school as their first preference, it will appear to be a first preference for both local authority's schools. Put another way, a school in authority A will be the parents' first preference; if they are not successful there, they will want to go to a school in authority B, but when they submit authority B's form it appears that authority B's school is their first preference, so a child living in authority B may not get the place. Issues arise there which can be discussed between LEAs, and solutions arrived at across border, and it is important that solutions be found. Where good schools are close to LEA borders—nothwithstanding the Greenwich judgment, which gives parents choice—parents should be able to choose, but it should be choice on a level

	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
playing field, so that LEAs are clear about whether an application is genuinely a first preference, or is a second choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that this is a difficult matter which causes much heartache for parents whose children are unable to attend the school of their choice. It is important that we scrutinise the admissions code of practice policy most carefully to ensure that it operates in the fairest and best possible way. I repeat that Opposition Members share a number of concerns about the code as it stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.53 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Atkinson.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some members of the Committee have often heard me speak about the code of practice, so they know that I am extremely unhappy about a number of aspects of it. I do not intend to go into the detail of each issue because we did that when we discussed the orders, but if my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough succeeds in catching your eye, Mr. Atkinson, he might pick up on some of them anyway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a more general note, after looking at the code of practice overall and at the way in which it is packaged, one wonders whether the Government have not gone out of their way to try to produce a policy deliberately designed to maintain the English class structure and to protect the interests of upwardly mobile white middle-class parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see that that rankles with the Minister. However, were she and her Government to produce such a code of practice, it would have a number of pretty obvious characteristics, such as protecting the class system and supporting the upwardly mobile. Such a code of practice would enable parents with cars and money to get their children to what they believed to be the best state school within reach, irrespective of the local education authority. That is exactly what the code of practice on admissions does as a result of the continuing adherence to the Greenwich judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A code of practice that promoted such aims would also support parents who were smart enough to play the system by indicating several preferences. Those parents would have an advantage over less articulate parents who found it difficult to cope with forms. The code of practice on admissions does that by supporting the Rotherham judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hypothetical code of practice that I am describing would also enable oversubscribed popular schools—to which ambitious middle-class parents send their children—to say no to excluded pupils with challenging behaviour. The unpopular schools—sadly called sink schools by some—would be forced to take such children, making their position even more difficult. That is what the code of practice on admissions does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hypothetical code of practice that I am describing would enable schools to select some pupils by aptitude, preferably in the subjects that white middle-class children are likely to do well in. However, selection by aptitude for other subjects, such as sport, would not take place. Such a code would go even
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
further and would state that once a child was in, his or her brothers and sisters must be allowed in, whether or not they have the aptitude. That is what the code of practice on admissions does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hypothetical code of practice would allow Church schools to interview potential pupils and their parents, who would have a right of appeal to the Secretary of State, should admission be refused. However, black and Asian pupils who were refused admission would not be given the right of appeal because of their race. That is what the code of practice on admissions does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The code of practice is badly flawed because it contains those fundamental problems. It does not provide a fair deal for the less articulate, the poorly educated, the socially excluded and low-achieving families and their children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will explain why that is so by developing a few points that I have made. The Labour Government are signing up to a Conservative inheritance in a number of areas. The response that the Minister gave in a debate on the Education (Relevant Areas for Consultation on Admission Arrangements) Regulations 1999 on 18 March 1999 was revealing. Speaking about aptitude and selection, she said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The subjects that one can select on by aptitude and the word itself are all rolled over from legislation which we inherited from, the Conservatives".—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee 6DL,</i> 18 March 1999; c. 21.]</p></blockquote>
Of course, that Conservative legislation was opposed by the Labour party when it was in opposition. However, that was the best response that the Minister could give.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) was right to pick up paragraph 5.16 in the code. That paragraph gives a definition of aptitude, and is probably one of the most brilliantly worded sentences that I have seen in a Government document for a long time. Let me remind the Committee of what it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A test for aptitude must test for the subject aptitude concerned and not test for ability or any other aptitude."</p></blockquote>
As the hon. Member for Maidenhead rightly said, that is the best that the Government can do. However, the Minister has not replied to some fundamental questions. Why, for example, is there a particular list of subjects? Why is science—surely one of the most important subjects in the national curriculum—not included in the list? Why is aptitude for some subjects to be tested, but not aptitude for others—and certainly not aptitude for science?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned selection and interviews for admission to Church schools and a debate took place here and in another place. My noble Friend Lord Tope raised the issue with Baroness Blackstone, who explained on 11 March why the Government distinguished between comments made by Church schools and Churches over admissions:
	<br><blockquote><p>"church schools requested that they should continue to be able to interview parents about denominational commitment and this … the Government conceded."</p></blockquote>
The churches, she admitted,
	<br><blockquote><p>"do not take quite the same position as the church schools".</p></blockquote>
I asked in our Committee why the Government chose
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0501">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
to accept the vested interest views of the Church schools rather than the more reasonable and dispassionate views of the Churches. I concede that Baroness Blackstone went on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Clearly, this is something we shall want to monitor to see how it works in practice."—[	<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 11 March 1999; Vol. 598, c. 442.]</p></blockquote>
I hope that that monitoring will take place and that we will receive the results quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to make two or three other brief points. First, although I have raised the matter before, I am going to raise it with the Minister again because I fail to understand, particularly in the light of the Stephen Lawrence report, why black or Asian parents who wish to appeal admissions decisions on grounds of ethnicity have no right of appeal to the Secretary of State when an appeal can be mounted on grounds of religion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 18 March the Minister said in response to my question:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We did not under pressure retain similar powers on gender and ethnicity for the Secretary of State."—[	<i>Official Report, 6DL,</i> 18 March 1999; c. 20.]</p></blockquote>
That is no answer whatever. Why should one group have the right of appeal to the Secretary of State when other groups do not?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have still not had an answer to the question raised by the hon. Member for Maidenhead about adjudicators. We know that several adjudicators have been appointed but we have yet to see a copy of the job description. I hope that one will be made available at least to members of the Committee, and preferably to the whole House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, is the Minister satisfied that within the code of practice the regulations are now clear? I suggest that they are extremely confused and confusing. People were told during the passage of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 that they would be allowed in principle to complain to the adjudicator about selection, yet the code of practice specifically denies them that opportunity. A clear promise made by the Labour Government has now been broken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have raised some issues and would like to raise others. I am unhappy with the code of practice and I hope that we will receive some clear answers that will help those who have to interpret and use the code to have a better understanding of how it will work in practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.3 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Atkinson, because we have already met today. I would like to thank the Committee for its enthusiasm when my hon. Friend the Member for Bath (Mr. Foster)—my leadership friend—announced that I was trying to catch the Chairman's eye.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have three quick points. First, it is an enormous disappointment to the Liberal Democrats that the code of practice does not engage with the Greenwich judgment—an issue that will constantly haunt the Government. While it is, as my hon. Friend the
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
Member for Bath said, a charter for the middle classes—and certainly for Government Ministers—we are not proud of it. The hon. Member for Maidenhead made it clear that, under the code of practice, it would have been possible for a school to have an admission scheme which allowed for sensible cross-border arrangements in the catchment area. If that is the main objective in London, where there is a ridiculous divide between one authority and another, it would have helped enormously if the Government could have picked that up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to deal with the Rotherham judgment. I am grateful to the Minister first for paragraph A.30 in the code of practice which clarifies the law and secondly for her letter of 31 March which she copied to other members of the Committee. It is clear from both the code of practice and the Minister's letter that the Rotherham judgment gives primacy to a parent who makes a preference over those who make no preference at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How does that help the child in a deprived area whose parent does not fill in any preference form and who can be denied access to schools within the local or wider area simply on the basis of the lack of parental interest? If we are talking about an education system for the many and not the few and if we are trying to raise the standards of those who have constantly underachieved, we must look at the admission arrangements to make sure that someone looks after those children whose parents do not fill in preference forms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A hypothetical situation has been brought to my attention by a local authority in Yorkshire. If the first preference of a parent is out of catchment and is in another authority but the second preference is the local school, can the LEA, as the admissions authority, have an admissions policy that says that a second local preference will always come first? That would not be contrary to the Rotherham judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consider the case of parents who want to send their child to a specialist music school across the border in Lancashire when their local Yorkshire school is a good school. They might put the music school in Lancashire as their first preference and not get in and then find that they have no preference for their second school. As a party we would like to establish the right of an admissions authority always to say that the children who live most locally to that school should have a right to attend it. That expands the issue in terms of the Greenwich judgment too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bath rightly referred to excluded children and the Minister will know that I will continue to return to that issue. In the authorities I worked in oversubscribed schools were able to have unruly children permanently excluded and because they had a waiting list could immediately take in another child. They had no reason ever to take an excluded child.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One way round that problem, although it is not an ideal solution, would be to say that when a school excludes a pupil it should keep that place open for that session to allow an excluded pupil from somewhere else to come in. It would be only for that session as it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0502">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
would be quite wrong to penalise a school by keeping a place open for a whole year. That is not a realistic proposition, but one session would be a halfway house. It would tell the LEA that Leafy Lane must take its share of the difficult children throughout the authority. I believe that schools would accept that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I echo the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Bath. We are disappointed about Greenwich. We are pleased that there has been some movement on the Rotherham judgment, but the code of practice is, as Baroness Blackstone conceded on 11 March, extremely complicated to administer. I foresee all sorts of challenges to it in the coming years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.9 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Estelle Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of us have been here on a number of occasions and have debated these issues long and hard over the past 12 months. I am grateful to those who have spoken today for not going over old ground. I shall try to respond to some of the difficult issues that have been raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government will need to monitor the situation. Education is vital for children and matters to parents more than anything else. The difficult issue of school selection will be resolved only when we can be sure that every school is a good school and when parents are prepared for their children to go to any school, whether it is their first, second or third choice, because, despite disappointment if it is not their first choice, they can be assured that the quality of education is good. We inherited an education service with disparate standards and the consequences of not getting their first choice is incredibly important to some parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the background against which we are debating the matter. I shall resist talking about the measures that we are taking to ensure that every school is a good school, but hon. Members should not forget that that is the real challenge; it is not muttering over the words of the admissions policy to mitigate the effect on people who have to make that choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I assure the hon. Member for Maidenhead that we have no intention of changing our stated policy on selection to grammar schools. That will lie with parents and the date in the guidance fits in with the legislation on the ballot rather than anything else. There is no ulterior motive. We have dealt with the matter and are not keen to return to it in the next few years because we want to get on with other things. I hope that the hon. Lady will accept my assurance. I was pleased to have the opportunity to provide it as there was some concern about the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to remember that the adjudicator resolves disputes and does not invent them or impose them on local admissions authorities, schools or areas. He or she is not called in to play unless there is a dispute. If there is a dispute at the moment, it often comes to the Secretary of State. We want decisions to be made locally, but we accept that unless someone is available or there is a mechanism to resolve the dispute, time will be wasted, decisions about school entry will be delayed and no good purpose will have been served. I ask those who are not in love with the idea of the adjudicator always to bear it in mind that
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
decisions will have to be made on different alternatives proposed by different groups or individuals. If an adjudicator comes up with an idea that might be an acceptable alternative, it must go back to those who were involved in the original decision making. The adjudicator is so named because he is an arbitrator between different points of view and that is necessary to the system. It will be interesting to see, as the system takes shape, how often adjudicators are called into play. My wish is that they be used as little as possible. We are creating local admissions authorities so that decisions are made in the interests of local children without having to call on adjudicators. It is not that I do not want them to have any work to do, but we shall monitor the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Maidenhead referred to standard numbers. The standard number may be more than 30—for example, it could be 60, which is a multiple of 30, or it could be 45 if the school has mixed age classes. Schools will have an obligation to organise classes of not more than 30, except in the small number of cases for which we have given exemption and which we debated earlier. I cannot trace my comment, to which the hon. Lady referred, about admission numbers being more than 30. The bottom line is that, whatever the admissions number, it must be a multiple of 30 or there must be mixed ability classes. I have approved some which are below 30 because the areas concerned do not have many children in schools, but most important is the obligation on schools to organise children in groups of 30, of one age group or more than one. The hon. Lady said earlier that the position was unclear. I assure her that it is important to have class sizes of 30 and of no more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady asked a difficult question about compulsory school age. That matter is a minefield, in which the previous and the present Government have avoided getting involved. I shall continue that practice. If there is only one admission point, the schooling of a child who is born on 30 August or 1 September can be put back a year, which can make a major difference to his or her emotional and social development. I am not sure how to resolve the problem. I accept that the specified dates are arbitrary. However, I believe that the dates in the previous system changed according to when Easter fell, which was not very helpful. When nursery vouchers were introduced, the previous Government were keen to used fixed dates. I accept that that approach may involve rough justice, although schools may be accessed at different stages during a child's development, depending on his or her date of birth. Reforming the system would impact on a different group of children, but I am not convinced that it would improve the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real answer—this deals with the hon. Lady's other question—involves ensuring that starting school is not a trauma or such a change that it affects the security of a child and his or her education. As the transition between early-years education and school becomes more effective, the decisions that parents and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0503">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
teachers take about entry to reception class should pay more attention to what is in the child's best interests and less attention to the child's chronological age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our proposal is that a place should be retained when a parent says, "I want my child to go to that school." That approach acknowledges that sometimes parents do not want their child to take a very early reception place. Legitimate concerns have been expressed on that matter. A place may be taken although the parents may not feel that attending a reception class is in their child's best interests. I am not sure that our approach has been entirely sorted out or that it is fully developed, and I am sure that we shall consider the matter again. Perhaps our policy will develop in ways that I cannot presently envisage. Much depends on the expansion that we are encouraging in early-years education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our aim must make early-years education coherent between the ages of three and eight. The question is really about how to manage the transition from early-years to infant education. That matter was not previously considered in detail because we did not emphasise the importance of early-years education. That is now part of the education scene. We need to examine the evidence and to make the transition easier, and we should never forget that, in relation to such choices, parents are our partners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Maidenhead raised some interesting and important issues in this context. Our efforts to expand early-years education means that we are beginning to address those issues. Having reflected on them in the light of experience, I suspect that we shall return to some of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady made an interesting point that was picked up by the hon. Member for Bath about first choice preferences in two local authorities. I share with the hon. Gentleman a constituency interest in the matter. My experience is that parents apply to both local authorities and that one local authority is not necessarily nominated as the first choice and the other as the second choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to consider the matter, and perhaps discuss it with local authorities. They should be made aware of the issue and attempt to deal with it, perhaps in the admissions forum. I do not want to say, "We shall ban the practice. We shall use a form that requires a first and a second preference." The hon. Lady rightly said that admissions forums should try to resolve the problem. I appreciate the seriousness of the matter. At the end of the day, the fact that we do not know which place will be accepted means that vacant places are involved. We are moving towards a system in which admissions authorities are encouraged to act together to give cohesion to applications, which should ease the problem because people will not hang on to two or three places while they wait for their first choice to offer a place. I hope that deals with the point that was made by the hon. Member for Bath.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman raised a number of issues that he regards as contentious but we do not. I do not deny him the right to raise such important issues at this
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
crucial point in his career development. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I have not participated in such a good debate on social class for a very long time. It reminded me of my early years in politics, when many late evenings were spent debating social class and doing away with the class structure. However, times have changed for the Labour party, if not for the Liberal Democrats.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today, the issues are social opportunity, mobility and providing access to jobs that past generations were unable to enjoy. I shall let the hon. Member for Bath have his debate on the definition of social class, but we want to ensure that education provides the key to life chances, regardless of social class and background. Everyone agrees with that goal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the comments made by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough, it is true that some sections of our community are less able than others to access life chances through education. Labour politicians must keep their eye on that and encourage children to achieve. Initiatives, such as Excellence in Cities, the extra money that has been put into sure start and the doubling of provision for three-year-olds are among the best ways to ensure opportunity. Such initiatives may not be headline grabbing, and, compared to past discussions of social class, I am perhaps less likely to stay up till the early hours of the morning talking about such initiatives with colleagues over a drink or two. That said, I appreciate that Liberal Democrats have expressed a genuine concern that the creation of structures might deny opportunity, but I believe that our plans to invest in the provision of education will provide opportunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful that the Minister is treating our remarks seriously and I recognise that her intentions are genuine, but, as I said, and as my hon. Friend the Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough starkly illustrated, there is a real problem with admissions policy. Because of the Rotherham judgment, the children of parents who fail to fill in admissions documents in an LEA area may lose out. Some mechanism should be put in place to require LEAs to check up on parents who are known to have children, but who have failed to fill in the relevant forms, just as, for example, local authorities make real efforts to persuade people to fill in electoral registers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, the hon. Gentleman and I are not a million miles apart, because I agree that that is an issue with which we must deal. In the light of the Rotherham judgment, we could take the view that, because some people do not express a preference, we will ignore those at the other end of the continuum who do. We do not want to do that and nor, I think, do the Liberal Democrats. The realisation that preference will be taken into account as an oversubscription criterion has helped to clarify matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept entirely that we must assume that parents who do not fill in the form care as much about their children as those who do. Indeed, such an assumption should be applied throughout education. I do not believe that parents would not, or could not, fill in the form if support were provided. I do not wish to sound
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0504">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
patronising or arrogant, but the solution lies partly in changing the behaviour of such parents, to enable them to understand the consequence for their children of their decision. I agree with the hon. Member for Bath that we must make the effort to make that happen. Our guidance to LEA admissions forums states that they must be proactive in ensuring that the forms have been filled in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give an example, although I do not wish it to be interpreted as statutory guidance. If I were on an admissions forum, I would advise teachers to offer support to illiterate parents or parents whose English language capability is insufficient to enable them to fill in the form. That would bring about a change in culture and parents would then be part of the process. I am happy to work with admissions forums and others to ensure that parents fill in the forms. The consequence of parents not doing so is felt not by them but by their kids.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have debated the question of excluded children before, and I have great sympathy with the views of the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough. We have not yet found the answer. The problem with "revolving doors" is that if we leave an excluded child's place open in an over-subscribed school, the well-behaved children on the waiting list who have worked hard and caused no trouble will see that place go to a child who has been excluded from school rather than to them. I would find that difficult to justify to parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept, however, that some schools do not at present take their fair share of the most challenging pupils; others have no option but to take more than their fair share. Some of the latter schools manage remarkably well, yet do not receive the recognition that they deserve, as the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough knows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to address the problem in a number of ways, primarily to stop children being excluded in the first place. I hope that the initiative that we have launched in financing Excellence in Cities will ensure that, in the pilot areas, all children have access to an on-site unit—even if it is not at their school—where they can be catered for rather than excluded. I hope that that will lead to fewer exclusions in the immediate term. It has certainly worked in a case centre in Birmingham, and in St. Matthew's school in Manchester, which I have visited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State is keen to solve that problem, and despite the fact that we have consulted many people, no one has proposed a solution about which we feel confident. The issue needs to be tackled from two angles. First, exclusion needs to be stopped. Secondly, schools need a respite, so that they can use resources such as mentors or on-site units instead of having to push for exclusion. I accept everything that the hon. Gentleman says—we are at one on this difficult issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have changed some of the regulations, so that, apart from at the normal point of entry, a school can refuse to admit children, even though there are places, on the grounds that they have been excluded from
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
another school and their behaviour would make life too difficult. We have acted to ensure that schools that have been subject to special measures, or that have serious weaknesses, will not be expected to accept another group of such children when they already have enough problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That action was a minimum first step, but we need to do more. It is a question not merely of sharing the burden, but of fairness to children. They get better attention in schools where there are role models and an ethos of achievement, rather than a high number of excluded pupils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Ward</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend clarify the right of parents to refer the admissions criteria—especially on partial selection—to the adjudicator? There have been problems with admissions criteria in my constituency, and surrounding areas in south-west Hertfordshire. It would be helpful if she would clarify the opportunities that parents will have to refer such matters. Which parents, and how many, will have such opportunities? Many parents in my area are relying on the school admissions code of practice to solve the problems of the past few years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. She has raised the issue in numerous Adjournment debates, has brought delegations to the Department and has taken every opportunity to try to solve the problem. It is a huge issue for a few local authorities in this country, and she happens to represent one where it has a major impact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On partial selection, we gave the option to parents because it became clear, after we had made our original drafts and as a second step in our thinking, that none of the admission authorities would choose to object to any other body's admission arrangements as it was not in their interest to do so—they were part of a system with which they were content. We did not want a situation, which could have arisen, in which many parents objected to the admissions arrangements in their local area but could not find an avenue to make those objections heard. The right is the only exception in the code, and it applies if 10 parents in the area object. We will lay down clear guidelines, to which the code under discussion refers, on what adjudicators must take into account before coming to a decision. We will look at what happens in areas such as Watford and the surrounding areas, and we will reflect on it. Parents in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Watford will have the opportunity to have the competing claims on admissions arrangements reviewed by an adjudicator. My hon. Friend has been a vocal advocate for the parents in her constituency who have suffered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to finish with a brief comment on aptitude, which we could debate for an hour and a half. I shall rest on the comment made by my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Norfolk (Dr. Turner), who is not present today. He asked hon. Members who they
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0505">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
would want as the pilot when they boarded a plane—somebody who has the ability or somebody who has the aptitude. When we reflect on that, we all know whose plane we want to board. There is a difference between aptitude and ability.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of specialist schools is a difficult one, and we have made our position clear before. Every school should strive for excellence in all that it does, but we would wish some schools to play to their strengths. This is the umpteenth debate that we have had on this complicated issue. The five sets of regulations that we discussed on the previous occasion were immensely technical. I think that we approached this matter the wrong way round. It is the code of practice that gives birth to the regulations, and I wish that we had debated them together.

We have redrawn the framework of schools in this country over the past 18 months. That is why it is such a complicated issue, on which there is so much guidance. We must get it right. Debating and arguing about how to get into a school reduces the energy that we have for the real challenge, which is raising standards for all our children in every school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we are coming to the end of the statutory orders that need to be laid to put the new structure in place. I am grateful for the contributions of Labour Members and, in fairness, Opposition Members, who have helped us to hone our ideas over the past 18 months. I thank you, Mr. Atkinson, for your fairness, and hope that the regulations find favour with the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. May</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am bound to say to the Minister that I suspect that one or two more regulations may appear, and that we may address each other across one of the Committee Rooms again soon.

The Minister did not answer the question about aptitude and ability in relation to the pilot flying the plane. I would hope that the pilot was able to fly the plane, as well as having an aptitude for doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the Minister for responding specifically to so many of the issues that have been raised in relation to the code and for clarifying one or two points. I am particularly grateful to her for saying that she will reconsider the approach to cross-border preferences and raise that issue with local education authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady agree that it would have been helpful if the Minister had told Committee members whether they will receive copies of the job descriptions of adjudicators?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Lady will allow me to answer that question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no desire to keep secret the job descriptions of adjudicators. They are public figures who are paid from public resources, so it is entirely understandable that hon. Members should want to know exactly what they are supposed to be doing. Whether the document is the one described by the hon. Member for Bath or another that says the same thing, I hope that he will let me exercise my discretion. I shall certainly ensure that the hon. Gentleman knows what adjudicators are doing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms May</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Bath for his intervention. It was appropriate for the Minister to respond to that question, so I am grateful to her for doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I heard what the Minister said about the role of adjudicators and the Government's desire that there should be someone to whom parents can object on the issue of partial selection. That is an important issue because the adjudicators will have significant powers to take decisions on the basis of objections from 10 parents. It is important that people are clear about the adjudicators' job descriptions and about how they will reach their decisions, so that everyone is clear about the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that I was grateful to the Minister for agreeing to reconsider the issue of cross-border preferences, I remain concerned about certain aspects of the code. That will not surprise the Minister, because I raised those aspects earlier. Whatever the Minister says about aptitude and ability, it is still an issue. We have had long debates about it, but the Government insist that one cannot admit a child to a school on the basis of that child's ability. Yet, the document "Excellence in Cities", to which the Minister referred several times, says that some children will be selected for preferential treatment, in the sense of receiving a different learning experience, on the basis of their ability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government started by saying that they could not measure ability, and that is enshrined in the admissions code. Yet the Secretary of State is prepared to say, as he did in "Excellence in Cities", that ability could not be used to select a child for a school but it could be used to select a child to have special lessons in another school. The Government have got themselves into a terrific mess because they are trying to succeed in meeting the requirements of all sorts of groups, but those requirements contradict each other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I continue to be concerned about the role of adjudicators and about not allowing schools to interview children. I do not agree with all the points raised by the hon. Member for Bath, which will not surprise him because we have discussed many of them in the past. However, I am interested to note that in order to launch a leadership campaign in the Liberal Democrats, one must be against the middle classes, as the hon. Gentleman made clear today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
