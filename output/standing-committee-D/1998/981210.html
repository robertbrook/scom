	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Jon Owen Jones)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><q><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Government of Wales Act 1998 (Housing) (Amendments) Order 1998.</p></q>
Hon. Members will recall that under section 140 of the Government of Wales Act 1998, the functions of Tai Cymru, including its regulatory functions, were transferred to the Secretary of State for Wales on 1 November 1998.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a non-controversial order, to be made under powers conferred on the Secretary of State under the 1998 Act. It is designed to close a loophole in landlord and tenant legislation that arises as a consequence of the transfer of Tai Cymru's functions to the Secretary of State. The order is designed to preserve the status and rights of tenants of residential buildings acquired, or disposed of, by the Secretary of State in the exercise of functions that were previously exercised by Tai Cymru. Specifically, it would allow the Secretary of State to offer assured or secure tenancies to housing association tenants if it proved necessary for him to do so under the provisions of part III of the Housing Association Act 1985. The Secretary of State's intention to lay an affirmative order before the House to correct that loophole was acknowledged in the notes on clauses prepared for the House of Lords stages of the Government of Wales Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under current legislation, the Secretary of State cannot offer secure or assured tenancies. The order amends a number of pieces of legislation to correct that and to protect the rights of tenants who find their tenancies being taken over by the Secretary of State in exercise of his functions in relation to the regulation of registered social landlords. However, it is extremely unlikely that the Secretary of State would ever have to exercise those functions. When its functions were transferred to the Secretary of State, Tai Cymru held no tenancies. Indeed, at no time between its creation in 1989 and the transfer of its functions to the Secretary of State on 1 November has Tai Cymru held tenancies under the powers in part III of the Housing Associations Act 1985, or under any other powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Against that background, we believe that it is very unlikely that the Secretary of State would have to take over housing association tenancies or otherwise grant assured or secure tenancies. However, in the interests of tenants we need to provide for that eventuality. For example, it a registered social landlord suffered financial collapse, it might be necessary for the Secretary of State to take over its assets, including its
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>3</span>
properties and any tenancies. If there should be such a collapse, the preferred course of action would be for the tenants of the failing housing association to be taken over by another registered social landlord and the Welsh Office, or National Assembly, would do all that it could to secure such an outcome. The regulatory controls now exercised by the Secretary of State are designed to ensure that appropriate intervention can be made well before an association faces financial collapse and that an appropriate restructuring plan is put in place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his role as a regulator, the Secretary of State has adopted the exacting standards set by Tai Cymru that all registered social landlords must attain. Those standards are contained in the regulatory requirements, and registered social landlords are scrutinised against those requirements in a number of ways: through analysis of financial information; audit visits; review and publication of performance tables; and other statistical returns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have been able to demonstrate that, given the evidence of Tai Cymru's experience and given the rigorous regulatory regime that remains in place, it is unlikely that the Secretary of State will need to exercise those powers. However, should that need arise, the Secretary of State—or, later, the Assembly— will want to have available the full range of options in exercising those functions under the Housing Associations Act 1985 to protect the rights of tenants. I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. If hon. Members so wish, they may remove their jackets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.36 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ribble Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister to what I assume is his first experience of a statutory instrument Committee as a Minister; it is certainly my first experience of shadowing him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that the order is not controversial; having listened to him, and having read the relevant documents, I think that that is the case. In many ways, it is a technical measure, and as I obviously excel in that area, I thought that I would ask him one or two questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman says that he cannot envisage the Secretary of State using the powers that the order transfers. Did he say that Tai Cymru had never used those powers? If so, it is extremely unlikely that the Secretary of State would ever need to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 143(3) of the Government of Wales Act 1998, on page 73, states:
	<br><q><p>"The Secretary of State may by order make any consequential, incidental, supplementary or transitional provisions, and any savings, which appear to him to be appropriate in consequence of or otherwise in connection with"</p></q>
the transfer of those functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What sort of consequential, incidental, supplementary or transitional provisions or savings might the Secretary of State make, once the powers are transferred to him? Once the Assembly is up and running next year, will the powers that the order transfers be transferred to the First Secretary? If so, will the Secretary of State retain any of the powers that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0369">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
the order transfers? In other words, may the Secretary of State transfer some, but not all, of the powers that the order transfers to him? If so, what powers does the Minister envisage the Secretary of State retaining for himself?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, if the Secretary of State for Wales and the First Secretary are from different political parties, where would the priority rest? Could the Secretary of State take the powers back from the First Secretary if he thought it appropriate to do so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.38 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to spend a few minutes speaking generally about the transfer, although perhaps not in such detail as the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Social housing is an extremely important part of the framework of any housing policy. I welcome the Secretary of State's indication that previous targets for home ownership, or owner-occupation, are not being targeted at present and that emphasis is now being placed on low-cost home ownership. I recognise that the majority of people aspire to owning their own home if they can afford to do so, but the level previously set was unrealistic. The extent of home ownership is an indicator of the state of the economy and of the distribution of wealth, as well as of house prices. We are all charged with creating the right circumstances in the best way to increase sustainable owner-occupation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that housing is related to many different factors, including poverty, health, unemployment and social exclusion in general. I welcome the Government's statement that they expect social landlords to take active measures to assist the Government in achieving their aims in welfare-to-work and in eliminating social exclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Outside the largest areas of Wales, few local authorities and almost no housing associations have large estates. Most of the housing stock, especially that of most housing associations is dispersed over large areas on small estates, and even comprises individual properties. In most cases, initiatives should be aimed at the community at large, not the tenants of social landlords alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The role of local authorities in developing appropriate strategies for all areas of deprivation, not only their own housing stock, should be considered. Hon. Members will known that in some parts of Wales, there might well be a need to change local authorities' perception of their role if they are to fulfil it effectively. All members of the Committee would agree that it is most important to recognise that investment in housing leads to benefits in other areas, such as employment and health, which I have mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tenants must be more involved in decisions which affect them. It is important that tenant participation is not mechanistic or purely structural. Social landlords must not end up consulting only a small number of non-representative tenants. It was right, in the main, that Tai Cymru increase its emphasis on housing for rent, not on low-cost home ownership. No one
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
interested in housing policy can deny that much work remains to be done in social housing. Consideration should be given to ending all grants and discounts that assist people into home ownership. Instead, assistance should be offered for repairs, improvements and adaptations, thereby assisting people to improve their circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the strategic and enabling role that has been given to local authorities and believe that there is room for improvement in the effectiveness of local authorities in fulfilling that important role. However, as I have said, not all authorities—certainly not all councillors—appreciate that fulfilling that strategic and enabling role imaginatively and effectively can have a far greater impact on housing problems than they realise. I have no dogmatic attachment to, or prejudice against, local authorities continuing to be social landlords, but it is important to reconsider their role carefully and in the round.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that there should be no further grants to private landlords for further provisions to improve the housing stock. I also believe that funds would be better directed straight into social housing. I welcome the swing to regeneration in preference to new build. The Minister and other hon. Members will know that, for the past few years, Tai Cymru has used the unit-cost analysis only and has not given enough consideration to rehabilitation as opposed to new build. Rehabilitation is far more environmentally sound and can do much more for our communities, where derelict buildings are in the centres of towns and villages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In their comprehensive spending review, the Government pledged, inter alia,
	<br><q><p>"to increase economic prosperity and improve the quality of life of the people of Wales and to promote social inclusion, and to extend democratic accountability … to improve the health of the people of Wales and lessen the inequality based on health status and to improve the quality of care in the community for those under social disadvantage."</p></q>
We all applaud those aims as a statement of broad principles, and housing is a core issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the social and economic cost of renovating private housing should be brought into the equation. There is a need to redirect capital resources to local authorities and housing associations on the basis of detailed evaluations of the medium and long-term needs of local communities. There is also a need for the corporate strategy of local authorities to be brought into account so as to work towards the regeneration of communities. Above all, there is a need for investment in people and communities, not simply in bricks and mortar, as many of us think was the case under the Tai Cymru regime. We need to give housing associations a broader role as community businesses to assist in the promotion of community projects and to generate training and employment opportunities locally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Housing associations should be under local control, via tenants. We need to draw a line under the old Tai Cymru thinking and the drift towards larger and larger housing associations being formed. Instead, we should be looking more at the local housing association model, such as exists in Scotland, where tenants have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0370">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
a greater feeling of purchase and involvement in the decisions being made—which are, after all, supposed to be in their interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should urge the National Assembly to review the current rent system of housing associations so that they can invest in their services to tenants and re-invest in housing stock, thereby investing directly in local communities. It is extremely important to keep an eye on rent levels. The answer may well lie in subsidising the capital costs at commencement, rather than subsidising the revenue costs via the benefits system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is apparent that the main responsibility of social landlords is to provide homes and premises of a high standard in accordance with best-value principles. The housing section of the National Assembly will come under considerable scrutiny in the next few weeks. It will have to accept responsibility for defining and improving performance standards within a recognised regulatory framework for social landlords. Government supervision will concentrate on the viability of housing associations and, thereby, the public purse, while ensuring the highest standards of service delivery in this important area of policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measure is not controversial, as the Minister said, and I shall not make it controversial. However, there are core principles in housing matters that are important in any discussion, however brief and non-controversial. The order will abolish a quango and establish accountability; it will open up possibilities for implementing new policies, which is an important aspect; and it will make it easier for housing policies to be run on a strategic basis and to target the need in various areas of Wales. With those flagged-up remarks, I very much welcome the transfer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is the duty of the Chair to protect the rights of Back Benchers and the ensure that they can represent the views of their constituents and express their opinions. I am known to be the most mild mannered and tolerant of Chairmen, but as the terms of the order are tightly drawn, I should be grateful if members of the Committee would stick to those terms from now on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.47 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lembit Öpik	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Montgomeryshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand the order, it will offer protection for tenants of social housing. It is conceivable that the provision could prevent problems arising in the first place, so the Secretary of State, and thereafter the Assembly, may never have to use it, but it is right that it should exist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.48 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I very much welcome that final contribution from the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. Öpik), who saw through to the heart of the measure, which is a sensible one. It will guarantee the rights that tenants would have retained under Tai Cymru, but because its functions have been subsumed into the Welsh Office and have become the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
responsibility of the Secretary of State, and ultimately the Assembly, the legalised mechanism to ensure that those rights are maintained does not currently exist. They will do so when the order is passed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the remarks of the hon. Member who speaks for the Opposition and, indeed, for Ribble Valley. The order will transfer responsibilities, not powers, to the Secretary of State—responsibilities which currently exist within Tai Cymru to preserve rights and to guarantee their continued preservation. However, all manner of fail-safe mechanisms would have to be broken down before the Secretary of State would exercise those powers or responsibilities and it is therefore difficult to foresee in what circumstances they would be necesary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) made an interesting and varied contribution—interesting because of the degree of licence he was allowed. I shall not risk annoying you, Mr. Gale, by answering him in detail; I shall say only that I agree with many of his points—particularly the one that underlay his argument, that housing is not an issue simply of bricks and mortar; housing is about providing people with homes within communities and about empowering those communities, enabling people to feel a sense of ownership of their houses—even if they do not legally own them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to look imaginatively at the provision of social housing in Wales. Unfortunately, there are many past examples of very badly directed social housing policies which have led to difficulties in many parts of Wales. Many mistakes—which I hope we shall not repeat—were made. Speaking for my part of Wales, I strongly believe that some of those housing policies, some of which were implemented by members of my party, were misguided and have led to problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman congratulates me too much, I should say that some of his party's housing policies were much more than misguided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As someone who spent the first five years of his life in a council house managed by Swansea town council—as it was then—I can tell the hon. Gentleman, on behalf of the many people who lived under such a regime, that it was not particularly pleasant and that we had no control whatsoever of our housing and felt no ownership of it. I am glad that that situation has changed dramatically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the Minister concludes, will he answer my question about whether any of the responsibilities, as he terms them, would be reserved to the Secretary of State after the Welsh Assembly comes into being? In a situation in which the posts of First Secretary and of Secretary of State are held by different people from different parties, where would ultimate control lie and could any of the responsibilities and other powers be transferred back to the Secretary of State?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
