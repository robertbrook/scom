Draft Fair Employment and Treatment (Northern Ireland) Order 1998</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Fair Employment and Treatment (Northern Ireland) Order 1998.</p></blockquote>
The Order consolidates and extends legislation on fair employment, which is unique to Northern Ireland. Promotion of equality among all sections of the population in Northern Ireland has been a priority of successive Administrations since the 1970s. No one in the Committee would disagree with the assertion that equality of opportunity is a fundamental human right. It therefore gives me particular satisfaction to bring the Fair Employment and Treatment (Northern Ireland) Order before the Committee today, the 50th anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights.<br><br>
This has been a momentous year for human rights in the United Kingdom generally and in Northern Ireland, in particular. It has seen the enactment of the Human Rights Act 1998 and the Northern Ireland Act 1998, which will establish a Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission. Among the wide-ranging functions of that commission, its task will be to consult and advise on the scope for a bill of rights for Northern Ireland. The new protections for human rights will complement the extensive protections against discrimination in Northern Ireland law, including fair employment legislation.<br><br>
When introduced in 1989, the principal objective of their fair employment legislation was described as a moral one. That remains true today. A person's opportunity to obtain employment and all its benefits should be determined not by which part of the Northern Ireland community he or she comes from but according to ability, and ability alone. The first such legislation was the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Act 1976. Much was achieved by that legislation, but by the mid-1980s it became clear that, while the 1976 Act was having an effect, there were still shortfalls and continuing differentials in the socioeconomic experiences of the two communities in Northern Ireland. That was confirmed by an extensive report on fair employment, which was produced at that time by the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights.<br><br>
Following publication of a White Paper, a second Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Act was introduced in 1989. It created new institutions with wider powers in the form of the Fair Employment Commission and the fair employment tribunal, and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
imposed new obligations on employers, not least in terms of monitoring their work forces. The new legislation introduced some of the toughest measures against employment discrimination available anywhere in Europe.<br><br>
Subsequently, the legislation was reviewed by SACHR and it reported in June 1997. The Government published their response to that report in a White Paper entitled "Partnership for Equality" in March 1988. The order carries forward the proposals in that White Paper, having taken account of the responses that were received. The legislation that has been, and is being introduced has, as its underlying principle, appointment and recruitment on the basis of merit. There is no question of reverse discrimination, quotas or any tampering with the merit principle.<br><br>
However, as generally recognised and accepted, established patterns of employment tend to perpetuate themselves, especially in a divided society. That can lead easily to the virtual exclusion of either Catholics or Protestants from a particular work force. Without any deliberate or malign intent, one section of the community may find itself effectively excluded from consideration when vacancies are being filled. That is why the legislation requires employers to take positive steps to open up their employment opportunities to applicants from all sections of the community. Equality of opportunity is not something that will happen on its own accord; it must be planned for and worked for, like other business objectives.<br><br>
Since 1989, the legislation has been amended twice: first, in 1991, to clarify the circumstances in which monitoring information could be disclosed and, secondly, in 1995, to remove the limit on compensation that might be awarded by the FET.<br><br>
There is evidence that the 1989 legislation has had an effect, but there is still some way to go to ensure equality of opportunity. The FEC monitoring terms show that appointments from the two communities roughly reflect applications for jobs from the two communities with, as might be expected, any marginal advantage by one community in one year being reflected by the opposite in another year. The beneficial effect of the legislation can also be seen in the composition of the Northern Ireland work force, particularly in regard to professionals, managers and administrators. Roman Catholics represent 36.5 per cent, of those employed as managers and administrators, compared with 30.5 per cent, in 1990.<br><br>
That is clearly a substantial gain, but there remains a gap between the Catholic share of employment and the Catholic share of the economically active population. The most recent monitoring statistics show that the Catholic share of employment was 38.8 per cent, while their share of the economically active population was 41.4 per cent. There is also evidence of continuing imbalances at the top of large organisations, not least the civil service, and—unsurprisingly—substantial evidence that Roman Catholics are far more likely to be unemployed than Protestants.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0524">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
I believe, therefore, that while the 1989 Act has, in the words of SACHR, had a positive impact on employment equality, there is still much to be done, not least in helping the unemployed, whether Protestant or Catholic, to secure employment. Members of the Committee will know that the Government's White Paper proposals are heavily focused on helping the unemployed acquire skills that will enable them to seek employment. The Good Friday agreement placed an onus on the Government to
<br><blockquote><p>"make rapid progress with … measures on employment equality included in the recent White Paper".</p></blockquote>
The order fulfils that commitment. It also makes a number of amendments and contains several new provisions to strengthen the law on fair employment, which are set out in the accompanying explanatory document.<br><br>
Before commenting on some of those changes, I should like to explain that the order is drafted in post-devolution terms, with transitional provisions to cope with the interim period. In other words, it is in line with the provisions of the Northern Ireland Act 1998. I shall highlight some of the key issues with which the order deals. First, it brings together in a single piece of legislation the 1976 and 1989 Acts, incorporating their various amendments. For the first time we have a consolidated piece of legislation covering all the elements of fair employment law. That will be of considerable help to all those who work with the legislation including employers, trade unions, the Commission and the fair employment tribunal.<br><br>
The order also extends the legislation to cover the provision of goods, facilities and services and the management and disposal of premises, including land, which brings fair employment law into line with that on sex discrimination and race relations. However, that is not the main reason for the change—the main reason is that it is the right thing to do. As a matter of principle, all unjustified discrimination, whether in employment or in any other area, should be unlawful and the opportunity is now being taken to extend the law in that respect. However, the order provides for reasonable exemptions. Since 1989, all except the smallest employers have been required to monitor annually the community background of their employees; larger employers and the public sector have also monitored job applicants. Monitoring is now widely accepted and understood, and employers have installed systems to meet the various requirements. The data that have thereby been generated have been extremely useful, but does not provide a complete picture of work force movement in terms of relative community participation. The order therefore extends the monitoring provisions to include all part-time workers and applicants for employment. In addition, larger employers will be required to monitor leavers.<br><br>
The new requirements will be set out in revised monitoring regulations which will be published shortly, but which will not apply until employers have had time to collect the relevant information.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
When the 1989 Act was going through its parliamentary stages, there was criticism that, while it assisted those in employment, it did little for the unemployed, especially the long-term unemployed. The order addresses that issue in two ways. First, article 75 enables an employer, if he wishes, to fill vacancies in his work force solely with people who have not been in work for a period of time specified by the employer, which will protect him against a charge of unlawful indirect discrimination. Of course, no employer will be compelled to recruit exclusively from the unemployed, but those who wish to will be able to do so.<br><br>
The second change in the law that will be of particular benefit to the unemployed is a permissive provision in article 77, which allows employers to provide training for people of a particular religious belief who are not in their employment. Until now, religion-specific training, as it is called, has been unlawful, but article 77 will enable members of an under-represented community to take advantage of training that will enhance their skill levels and help them to compete on more equal terms for vacancies when a subsequent recruitment exercise takes place. As with article 75, no employer will be compelled to provide this type of training.<br><br>
Other significant changes to the existing legislation include compensation for unintentional indirect discrimination in employment; action against persistent discrimination; new roles for the commission; extension of the law to cover barristers and larger partnerships; and the introduction of an appeal procedure against certificates issued by the Secretary of State for the purpose of safeguarding national security.<br><br>
That is all that I want to say at this stage about the provisions of the draft order, but I reiterate that fair employment and the elimination of unlawful discrimination continues to be an important issue and a priority for the Government in Northern Ireland. Enormous progress has been made in recent years and effective remedies are available to anyone who has a genuine grievance. Nevertheless, there is no room for complacency and there must be a continuing effort by all involved to ensure that the scourge of unlawful discrimination is finally eradicated from society. I commend the order to the Committee.</span></p>
<p>4.41 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Moss <span class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Cambridgeshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are grateful to the Minister for presenting this order today, which we welcome pretty well in its entirety. As he said, it is partly a consolidation measure that follows on from work done by the previous Government and the SACHR report, which he mentioned. All in all, the order is extremely welcome, although I have a number of points to put to him.<br><br>
First, although this is primarily a consolidation measure, it brings in some additional material and some new thoughts and articles. Does that mean that the normal route of parliamentary procedure has either been avoided or, perhaps, circumvented? The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0525">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
Northern Ireland Act 1998 sets up the Equality Commission and brings together the various commissions operating separately. There has been a slight dislocation in the time scale of setting things in place. Concerns were expressed by the various bodies and as a result of consultation, which I think is still continuing, an equality working group was set up under Dr. Joan Stringer, whose report is due at the end of January. Will the Minister tell the Committee whether, if the programme had gone to the Government's time scale, the order would not have predated the establishment of the full commission and that, by now, the main thrust of the 1998 Act would have been not only accepted but endorsed by all the parties coming together to work under the new umbrella? Perhaps, under the normal time scale, the order would have predated by some weeks or months the setting up of the commission and its workings in a way that would have carried the 1998 Act and its proposals forward in a positive way. I know that I am talking about a dislocation of only a month or two, but perhaps the Minister will comment on it.<br><br>
The new order, as the explanatory document tells us, broadens the scope of existing legislation to cover goods, facilities, services and premises. A question was posed several times by the noble Lord Lester of Heme Hill in the other place earlier this week that related to public authorities and discrimination. The point made to Lord Dubs—I do not doubt that the Minister has been briefed and that we shall receive an answer today rather than being answered by letter—was that the Northern Ireland Act 1998 covers direct discrimination on religious grounds by a public authority. The order covers direct and indirect discrimination by a public authority in providing services and facilities, but, because of the Amin case in the House of Lords, action can be taken only in relation to acts by public authorities that are done as if they were operating as private persons.<br><br>
Lord Lester of Herne Hill is a lawyer and he knows about these things; he pressed Lord Dubs not only during the debate on the Northern Ireland Act 1988 but when the order was being considered. Lord Lester believed that there was a gap in the legislation. If his reading is correct, it means that public authorities could be taken to task under the order only if they were acting as private persons and not, as they do in most cases, acting as public authorities. In terms of discrimination, there seemed to be a gap in the law.<br><br>
I turn next to articles 75 and 77, which are new. We welcome them. They are extremely positive initiatives, which, in certain cases, will help employers to go to the pool of unemployed as a preference. We hope that that will do something to help areas with pockets of high unemployment, where employers may be worried about the implications of fair employment. It is a good measure, and the Minister and his team are to be commended for it.<br><br>
In my time as a Northern Ireland Minister, I ran two large Departments, and came across a number of cases that had been taken to the Fair Employment
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
Commission. Some were obviously right and proper; it occurred to me, however, that others were a trifle vexatious. I was never allowed to comment; I kept clear of making a judgment on such cases because it was right that they should go through the full legal process. However, in answer to Lord Molyneaux of Killead, Lord Dubs said that if a case was deemed by the fair employment tribunal to be vexatious or frivolous, it had the power to award costs to the defendant. If possible, will the Minister confirm that that is so?<br><br>
Article 80 deals with security certificates, and I have a simple question. My understanding of how the article would work is a little thin; no doubt, the Minister can strengthen my understanding and that of the Committee. The Minister and I know what security certificates are, as we have both signed them. Will article 80 impinge on the right of the Royal Ulster Constabulary to hold suspects for interrogation or to resist requests for bail from those suspects pending their lawyers' setting up an appeal? I hope not, but the question springs to mind and I would appreciate some clarification.<br><br>
In the main, we welcome the order. It makes sense to consolidate existing legislation, because there will be only one document to consult. We also welcome the Government's new initiatives. I take this opportunity of praising the work of the Fair Employment Commission. Its ninth report recently landed on our desks. The commission has done sterling work over the years. Indeed, the depth of its work is unique within the United Kingdom.<br><br>
I also pay tribute to SACHR for its involvement over the years, and for the excellent report that it submitted last year. That was the basis for the White Paper and for the order that we are considering.<br><br>
Doubtless the Minister will write to me if he is unable to clarify the points that I made. However, those points have been made on several occasions. The Opposition simply seek clarification on the key matters that I raised.</span></p>
<p>4.50 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roy Beggs <span class='memberconstituency'>(East Antrim)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that equality of opportunity is a fundamental human right. In a civilised, democratic state, there can be no justification for unlawful discrimination. There should be fair treatment for all, irrespective of creed, colour or sex. Appointments should be made solely on merit.<br><br>
Article 39 provides for compensation to be paid to complainants. Paragraph (4) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Compensation awarded to a person under paragraph (1)(b) may include compensation for injury to feelings whether or not it includes compensation under any other head."</p></blockquote>
Has any assessment beem made of the overall cost to industry and public bodies in lost professional time, and in legal fees for defence against vexatious allegations of discrimination? Has the cost to health boards, education boards and other employers been quantified to establish the amount of money that is paid in out-of-court settlements to avoid legal fees and thereby save money?<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0526">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
There are valid grounds for compensating someone who has suffered discrimination. But are not there also valid grounds to allow a tribunal to award costs against a vexatious complainant? If the complainant is unable to pay, are not there valid grounds for the public purse to compensate those who are unfairly forced to defend actions that are taken against them, and that are often funded through legal aid?<br><br>
From experience in my constituency, I know about the waste of time and energy, and the costs incurred by a school principal and a board of governors who were falsely accused of discrimination in appointing someone. After a prolonged period, the claim was withdrawn, but the action diverted the principal from his professional duties and wasted the time of the volunteer school governors.<br><br>
Does the possibility of ex-gratia settlements encourage more complaints? Is there any record of the anecdotal professional claimant on grounds of discrimination?<br><br>
For the sake of fair and equal treatment for all, if a tribunal can award compensation for injury to feelings,
<br><blockquote><p>"whether or not it includes compensation under any other head",</p></blockquote>
should not respondents who suffer the embarrassment of facing unjustified complaints of discrimination be compensated for the hurt and damage caused by unsustained allegations? If that does not currently happen, can the Minister tell the Committee whether the Northern Ireland Assembly might consider the matter to ensure that there is justice for all?<br><br>
Will the regulations for monitoring returns be more specific than hitherto? Can we be assured that the high percentage of people not identified in the past as part of either the Protestant or Roman Catholic community will be significantly reduced to ensure greater accuracy in the figures on employed people and on those seeking employment?<br><br>
I welcome article 88 whereby a copy of a complaint can be sent to the Labour Relations Agency for the purpose of promoting a settlement. I pay tribute to the successful and amicable resolution of many complaints through the conciliation work of the Labour Relations Agency on behalf of both parties in disputes. I trust that the establishment of the Equality Commission will provide confidence that legitimate grievances will be addressed and that unlawful discrimination will not be tolerated in Northern Ireland.</span></p>
<p>4.55 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Members for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss) and for East Antrim (Mr. Beggs) for their contributions and for their broad welcome of the measure. They both raised genuine issues of debate.<br><br>
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire asked about the Order-in-Council procedure and why we were sitting in Committee today. Ideally, the process should have been subject to full parliamentary scrutiny through primary legislation. Initially, proposals were dealt with in that way and in an ideal world would continue to be dealt with in that way.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
However, we had to take several factors into account. Firstly, an imposition was placed on the Government as a result of the Good Friday agreement—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Beggs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Butterfill. There is a danger that the general public will be confused by references to the Good Friday agreement instead of the Belfast agreement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>:That is not a point of order for me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will continue to refer to the Good Friday agreement because it is such good news for Northern Ireland. I believe that "good" is appropriate; if it offends some people, they can use whatever term they want. Some have been condemnatory and that has not helped the peace process.<br><br>
A requirement was placed on the Government as a result of the Good Friday—or Belfast—agreement and the Government had to take account of it. The British Government most certainly will honour their commitments under that agreement and will insist that all other parties to it also honour their commitments. The agreement must be implemented in full: it cannot be subject to cherry-picking.<br><br>
It would have been difficult to make rapid progress without the White Paper, "Partnership for Equality", which set out what the Government were seeking to achieve in advance of the Good Friday agreement. Without it, we would have had to go through an extensive consultation period. We had already done so; the White Paper was issued and we wrote to numerous bodies and asked them to contribute their views. The hon. Member for East Antrim personally notified the Government of his views, for which I thank him.<br><br>
Interestingly, only two parties in Northern Ireland responded to the White Paper—Sinn Fein and the Social and Democratic Labour party. Subsequent agreements placed requirements on the Government, as I said. The expectation was that legislation would be introduced and would provide an appropriate time for comment. In an ideal world, I repeat, primary legislation would be the preferred option, but because of the factors that I have mentioned, we are proceeding with the process of delegated legislation.<br><br>
Consultation is taking place with the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister specifically on the process and generally on how Orders in Council should be handled. I do not want to extend the scope of the debate beyond saying that under the Northern Ireland Act 1998, all Orders in Council deemed by Government to be required will be subject to proper consultation with the new Assembly. It is right that the Assembly should express a view on matters on which the Government want to take action and for which they remain responsible. We have taken a belts-and-braces approach to the matter to try to ensure smooth relationships in working with the new Assembly. The procedure applied in this case has fully conformed to that approach.<br><br>
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire asked about the single Equality Commission and the anxiety expressed by what will become its constituent

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
bodies. In many ways we anticipated anxieties. Groups that have their own body to supervise activity in their area, whether it be disablement, race or sex equality, asked whether they would lose out. The Government took careful note of those anxieties, but felt that there was more benefit in trying to bring all those bodies together to give a major thrust to the concept of equality across the broad reach of all sectors. That ensures that we can, I hope, achieve joined-up thinking between different areas of possible discrimination. There is always a danger of proliferation causing confusion in this area. Consolidated legislation helps everyone involved. It helps business, trade unions and campaigners, all of whom have had to deal with different legislation. We have not quite reached that stage, but ultimately I envisage that being one of the benefits that might flow from the order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moss</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify that when Dr. Joan Stringer's report comes out at, say, the end of January, it will contain nothing that argues against anything in the order? I was trying to make that point in relation to the timing. The Government have listened to the anxieties that have been expresed and have gone the extra mile to accommodate all the constitutent groups that he mentioned. However, my question was, in terms of the timing, whether anything was likely to emerge from the working group that impinges adversely on the content of the order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was coming to that point. I cannot give guarantees for the future, but I am sure that the working group will tackle its business thoroughly, and we do not want to put fetters on it. Obviously, it must assist the Government in trying to achieve the objective.<br><br>
We welcome comments from any source. However, a fundamental issue has been missed. As I said in my opening remarks, the order has had to deal with two realities—the existing reality of the United Kingdom Government still having responsibility for the matter and the future reality of the Assembly having responsibility.<br><br>
Anything that emerges from the process of examination would obviously condition subsequent examination of the approach, The order is an important step forward, but not the final one. The history of the legislation has shown that as lessons are learned changes are made. We must take that into account. No Government stand still; nor will this Government. We shall constantly examine the efficacy and efficiency of the system that we have put in place, to try to ensure that it delivers the best governance possible. We are satisfied that what we are trying to do through a single Equality Commission is the best way forward, for those reasons and others that I set out earlier.<br><br>
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire referred to the Amin case and the view expressed by one Member in the other place that the order had somehow omitted to consider that judgment. We know that there is concern about the implementation
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
of the findings in that case, but such matters have not been avoided in the order. That issue was not raised by SACHR or in any response to the White Paper. It was never thought of as something about which people were agitated or exercised and which therefore required change under the order.<br><br>
The issue relating to the Amin case was raised by the Commission for Racial Equality in its third review of the Race Relations Act 1976. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary is consulting on the CRE's proposals. That will allow the issue to be considered in the appropriate context. It would be wrong to pre-empt that detailed consideration of United Kingdom legislation. The issue has not been omitted for any malign reason or because it was forgotten; it is being considered by Government and ways are being sought to implement the findings.<br><br>
The hon. Member for East Antrim used the word "anecdotal" when referring to vexatious claims. The Government will not act on anecdotes; we will act on the weight of evidence. No doubt, there will be vexatious claims; people make vexatious claims in any judicial process. However, costs can be awarded against vexatious litigants. Article 84(2)(i) provides the tribunal with the power to award costs in such circumstances. I do not have details in front of me on the number of such cases. Perhaps I could write to hon. Members if they would like further information on that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moss</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the Minister says, but the word "may" is used in the order. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Department may by regulations make such provisions as appears to it to be necessary or expedient with respect to proceedings before the Tribunal. The regulations may, in particular, include".</p></blockquote>
There is then a list, paragraph (i) of which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"for the award of costs".</p></blockquote>
It does not say that costs will be awarded, yet I think that Lord Dubs stated in the other place that there would be such a provision. There is a difference between the words "may" and "will".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I disagree fundamentally with the hon. Gentleman. The order uses the normal terminology of legislation. Such a provision must be used only when there is evidence of a need to do so. There is no point in having a range of regulations if they are not used. There is no difference between what my noble Friend Lord Dubs said in the Lords and what I have said. The order contains such a power, and tribunals can use it. Importantly, there must be a substantial weight of evidence to show that the use of the power is required.<br><br>
We must always be careful when dealing with such matters not to deter people from bringing cases. Many cases might be found to be vexatious, but the people bringing them will never accept that they were being vexatious. On other occasions, people might be deliberately vexatious. Judgments are made about the quality of the arguments advanced so judgments must be made about whether costs should be visited upon people, depending on the circumstances.<br><br>

The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire referred to security certificates. He asked whether an appeal to the tribunal would debar the RUC from going through the normal judicial process. It is most unlikely that that will be the case because a criminal proceeding takes precedence over a civil proceeding. If the RUC presses a criminal charge or if it opposes bail, it must press its case before the court considering the matter. I have no evidence that any appeal to the tribunal, such as that to which the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire referred, would debar the RUC from taking such cases forward.<br><br>
The hon. Member for East Antrim asked about the future role of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and I have alluded to that in some of my responses. The order will be implemented when the House has agreed to it and the regulations are in place, and that will probably be before the Assembly is up and running. Such matters will then be devolved to the new Assembly. It will be the Assembly's responsibility to consider what it wants to do with the legislation.<br><br>
The Assembly must debate amendments to legislation. The hon. Member for East Antrim raised that matter, and also asked about regulations on
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
monitoring. Hopefully, those regulations will be available by January. They are currently being drawn up and examined to ensure that they are robust and can withstand legal scrutiny. They will be subject to a negative resolution in this House, but will be subject to an affirmative resolution when they become the responsibility of the Assembly. Changes to the regulations will require a full debate in the Assembly.<br><br>
I hope that I have dealt with all the matters that have been raised. I anticipated a longer discussion, but it has been helpful to have this brief debate. The quality of the debate in Committee is sometimes higher than on the Floor of the House because specifics are tackled. I congratulate members of the Committee on raising matters worthy of consideration and I commend the order to the Committee.</span></p>
