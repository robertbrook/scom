<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department (Mr. Keith Vaz)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That, during proceedings on the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Bill [<i>Lords</i>], the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at Nine o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock.</p></blockquote>
I begin by welcoming you to the Chair, Mr. Benton. I hope that the Committee will be efficient, brief and speedy. I am pleased to guide this short Bill through its Committee stage. It reforms the common law rule of privity of contract and is the result of another excellent piece of work by the Law Commission.<br><br>
I should add to my comments on Second Reading that Lord Hacking spoke on behalf of the Construction Industry Council in another place and that its concerns have been fully addressed. I had a short interchange with the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Mr. Hawkins) and I said on Second Reading that if the construction industry wanted a dialogue with the Government, we would be happy to talk to it.<br><br>
I hope that hon. Members share my expectation of completing the Bill in one sitting. If necessary, we can continue longer, but one sitting should be sufficient.</span></p>

SHORT TITLE, COMMENCEMENT AND EXTENT</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nick Hawkins <span class='memberconstituency'>(Surrey Heath)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 5, line 36, after "day", insert
<br><blockquote><p>"or (unless the contract expressly otherwise provides) to a contract entered into after this Act comes into force where the parties are obliged to enter into that contract under a contract entered into before the end of that period.".</p></blockquote>
I join the Minister's welcome to you, Mr. Benton, as Chairman of the Committee. I share the Minister's wish that our proceedings will be brief.<br><br>
I tabled the amendment with the support of my hon. Friend the Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) and, I am delighted to say, the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett), who speaks for the Liberal Democrats on such matters.<br><br>
The amendment arises from concern that was, rightly, expressed by a major firm of City solicitors, Clifford Chance, which will be well known to most, if not all, members of the Committee. It has written to all members of the Committee following representations to the Minister and his officials. I pay tribute to the firm for its work on the matter, and it is a particular pleasure to do so because my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley) previously worked with that firm, although I did not know that until five minutes before our proceedings started.<br><br>
Clifford Chance's concern about clause 8 is that it creates ambiguity in the Bill. The Minister's Department told Clifford Chance that it was not prepared to amend the Bill to clarify it, but the firm believes that the Minister might set out his interpretation of the Bill and clarify any ambiguity, either today or when the matter comes before the House, which I anticipate will be next Wednesday. I hope that the Minister will be able to clarify the matter today because, following the case of Pepper <i>v.</i> Hart, discussions reported in <i>Hansard</i> can be relied on later in court. That includes Committee <i>Hansard,</i> as well as the <i>Hansard</i> report of the House.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Solihull, the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon and I tabled the amendment because we are concerned that, on one possible interpretation, the Bill might apply to a contract made after the Bill comes into force, even if that contract is executed pursuant to an obligation contained in an earlier contract, and the earlier contract was executed before the Bill comes into force. That might be regarded by non-lawyers in Committee as an arcane point, but given that some contracts are worth many millions of pounds or dollars, such matters can have considerable significance.<br><br>
Lawyers at Clifford Chance are concerned about one possible interpretation, based on the fact that the Bill will apply to contracts made after it comes into force. As the later contract will be executed after it comes into force, they are concerned that the Bill will apply to that later contract. That could mean that a third party might be able to enforce the terms of the later contract, even though the parties to the later contract were obliged to enter into a contract in that form because of contractual obligations contained in the earlier contract.<br><br>
In that case, there would be an element of retrospection, and the House of Commons is always keen to avoid passing legislation that has a retrospective effect. In setting out such points, there is a danger of sounding like Major Major Major in Catch-22, but there is a serious point here. Clifford Chance says that while that situation may apply to various types of contract, it believes that the potential implications would be of particular concern where the contract in question is a lease entered into pursuant to obligations contained in an agreement for a lease. Agreements for a lease are widely used in the commercial property world. Many years can elapse between the date on which the parties enter into the agreement for the lease and the date on which the lease is executed.<br><br>
Any of us who have ever had to deal with commercial property, perhaps very expensive commercial properties in the City of London or on industrial parks, are well aware that that is by no means an unusual situation. There are likely to be many agreements for a lease that precede the Bill, and the leases made pursuant to them will not be executed until after the Bill comes into force. However, there is an alternative interpretation of the Bill, which is that where the parties enter into an agreement for a lease before the Bill comes into force, they cannot have intended the terms of the subsequent lease to be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0260">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
enforceable by a third party because, at that time, it was not legally possible for contractual terms to be enforced by a third party. As the Bill states that the new law will not apply to a contract if it appears that the parties did not intend the term to be enforceable by a third party, it is arguable that the Bill would not apply to the subsequent lease.<br><br>
The Lord Chancellor's Department, the Minister and his officials have expressed the view that the second of those interpretations is correct. Bearing in mind the rule in Pepper <i>v.</i> Hart, it would undoubtedly be beneficial, to avoid any future uncertainty or dispute, if the Minister would place on record that he and his officials believe that the second of those alternatives is the correct interpretation. Therefore, I invite the Minister to place his view and the views of his officials on record this afternoon. I apologise to Committee Members for that slightly complex argument, but it is important and might have significant ramifications, in particular for major commercial property transactions. The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon may have dealt with some such transactions in his previous practice, to which he may wish to refer in more detail.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Burnett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Torridge and West Devon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I join the Minister and the hon. Member for Surrey Heath in welcoming you, Mr. Benton, as the Chairman of this Committee.<br><br>
As I said in earlier discussions, the Bill is worth while and its drafting is clear and intelligible. It is a credit to the Law Commission. I do not want to go over the same ground as the hon. Member for Surrey Heath, except to say that I am also grateful to Clifford Chance for the work that it has done, and for alerting us to a possible ambiguity. I should like to say that one of the senior partners at Clifford Chance retired today as president of the Law Society, after a distinguished and successful term of office. I pay tribute to Michael Mathews for what he has done.<br><br>
The amendment would clarify a possible ambiguity in the Bill, and it is important that the Minister should address it. There are many circumstances other than agreements for the lease in which subsidiary contracts are made, not least in finance agreements and building agreements. It is important to have the Minister's comments on the record, for the reasons set out by the hon. Member for Surrey Heath, especially in relation to Pepper <i>v.</i> Hart.<br><br>
The fundamental issue is whether an individual or person—I should use the word person, as the Bill will cover companies, trustees and everybody—can form an intention for an Act to apply when that Act does not exist. The Lord Chancellor's Department's interpretation is probably correct, and, in fact, my instinct is that one cannot. Nevertheless, in the terms expressed by the hon. Member for Surrey Heath, it is wise to put on the record exactly when and how the Bill will apply.<br><br>
The Bill principally applies to contracts entered into six months after it comes into force, unless the contract is entered into immediately after it comes into force and the contract expressly provides for its application. Certain other important exemptions exist, including the intention exemption.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
I look forward to the Minister's comments, which will enable us to decide whether to pursue the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can confirm that where an agreement is entered into after the commencement but pursuant to an obligation in an earlier agreement, the Bill will not normally apply to the later agreement so as to confer rights on a third party. Normally, the parties will not intend to confer rights of enforceability on a third party where it would not have been possible for them to do so under the law applying at the time of their pre-Act contract. However, that is not to deny that parties entering into a contract now, who will know that the Bill will make it possible for them to confer enforceable rights on a third party if and when it becomes law, might choose to bind themselves in that contract to confer such rights in a later contract entered into after the commencement of the Act. That will be a matter of the contracting party's intentions, and the proper construction of the later contract in the light of the earlier contract.<br><br>
I hope that that explanation is helpful to the hon. Member for Surrey Heath and the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon. I would not want people to believe that Clifford Chance, although it will be the largest firm of solicitors in the world, has a veto on policy or that we are bending our knee to its lawyers. That would be unfair, even though the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds is a former employee of Clifford Chance. However, I spoke to Richard Thomas before the Committee, and he was satisfied with the points that I made. He feels that the points that had been raised—given that they are now on the record—have been dealt with.<br><br>
I am glad that we had the opportunity to discuss the matter. If there is any ambiguity, I want to make the Government's policy clear, simply because I do not want firms of solicitors like Clifford Chance to be able in later years to go to court on their clients' behalf and challenge what we have done. I hope that that has made our position clear.</span></p>
<p>4.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Ruffley <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bury St. Edmunds)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I raise one specific point with the Parliamentary Secretary, on the way in which the Bill will interact with landlord and tenants legislation in respect of landlord covenance. That gives rise to an important question. Under new tenancies, will the Bill classify the obligations of an assignee of a landlord interest and an assignee of a tenant interest as a contract between those assignees? Will the Bill enable a third party who is a sub-tenant to sue? For example, the assignee of a superior landlord's interest may be subject to a landlord covenant. In such a circumstance, will the Bill directly enable the sub-tenant to sue the landlord on the landlord covenant?<br><br>
For the sake of completeness, I should say that that narrow point was raised by Richard Coleman, to whom the Parliamentary Secretary has spoken. That is no surprise: he is a most eminent real estate practitioner, and I was happy to serve as his articled clerk in 1988. I should be interested to hear the Parliamentary Secretary's views on the matter.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vaz</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raises a very important point. Depending on the intention of the parties and the Bill's clauses, all contracts can potentially satisfy that condition. If the hon. Gentleman is not satisfied with that answer, I shall write to him, but he will find that, potentially, the answer to his question is yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the Parliamentary Secretary's helpful clarification. As I said, this is a probing amendment designed to enable him to set out his interpretation of the Bill, so pressing it to a vote would serve no purpose. In the event of subsequent
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
litigation and potential uncertainty, he has stated the Government's interpretation of the Bill and it is clearly recorded in <i>Hansard.</i> Reference to it can be made should ambiguity arise. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
