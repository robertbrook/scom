<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ordnance Survey is the national mapping agency of Great Britain and has been part of government for 207 years. It is a Government Department in its own right and was one of the first executive agencies created in 1990. It is recognised throughout the world as setting standards to which other national mapping agencies aspire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ordnance Survey's aim is to satisfy the national interest and customer need for accurate and readily available geospatial data and maps of the whole of Great Britain in the most effective and efficient way. Ordnance Survey's mapping and geographic information play an important but often unsung role in a wide range of national and local activities, both for organisations and for individual citizens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Central Government, local authorities, public utilities and the emergency services make extensive use of Ordnance Survey maps, services and data in the planning and delivery of vital national activities. Many private businesses use Ordnance Survey maps and data in day-to-day operations, and members of the public make extensive use of them in their leisure activities, such as walking, touring and planning holiday trips.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over recent years, Ordnance Survey has completed a major programme to convert its quarter of a million traditional, large-scale paper maps into the national topographic database. That permits Ordnance Survey's data to be integrated with and add value to other data held by public and private sector organisations. It is important
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
to safeguard the consistency and quality of the national topographic database to ease the transfer of information against a common geographical base and reduce duplication of cost and effort across the wider community. To ensure national consistency of mapping, the Government announced last October a national interest in mapping service agreement—NIMSA—to cover the non-commercial activities that Ordnance Survey undertakes to ensure consistent, up-to-date and accurate mapping across Great Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until now, the Ordnance Survey has been funded by a parliamentary vote. That funding has steadily reduced over recent years as improved management techniques and the sharper focus of agency performance have introduced significant efficiencies into its day-to-day operations. The mapping of Great Britain is now more up to date and cost-effective to maintain than at any time in the past 207 years. The mapping and data are also made available to users in more forms than they have previously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, as customer expectations are rising all the time, Ordnance Survey must continue to improve its performance and invest in its future. I have considered with colleagues whether vote funding will allow Ordnance Survey to achieve that. My officials have consulted users of Ordnance Survey products and other stakeholders to seek their views. I have concluded that, on balance, a move to trading fund status would be of significant benefit to Ordnance Survey. A trading fund will give the director general of Ordnance Survey the flexible business and financial framework that he needs to follow the policy of continuous improvement and investment in products and services required by customers, while maintaining a consistent mapping base across Great Britain. Ordnance Survey will continue to expand its product range in partnership with private and public sector organisations. The best practices of a public sector ethos, a culture of efficiency and a businesslike approach, will be combined to the benefit of Government, customers, partners and all other stakeholders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consultation on the implications of a trading fund has been completed. A report on the consultation was placed in the Library of the House on 1 February. An innovative, but prudent five-year business plan has been prepared. The plan has been accepted by my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury. The overall financial target for the fund is to deliver an annual average of at least 9 per cent, return on capital employed over five years. A dividend holiday has been agreed for the first five years of the fund. A new framework document will be published on 1 April. Ordnance Survey will, of course, remain a Government Department, accountable through Ministers to Parliament and subject to ministerial checks, balances and performance targets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the scrutiny that the agency has been under in the last three years with the development of NIMSA and the preparation for trading fund status, I have decided with colleagues in the Cabinet Office that there would be little benefit at this time in subjecting Ordnance Survey to the prior options review due later this year. This will be postponed until spring 2001.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0263">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
The consultation that took place before I made my decision to propose Ordnance Survey's move to trading fund status indicated some concern among Ordnance Survey's customers that a trading fund might lead to high prices for Ordnance Survey products. To address these concerns, I have asked the director general, Dr. Geoffrey Robinson, to review the balance between pricing, profit and increasing the use of Ordnance Survey products. As part of the prior options review in 2001, I will be commissioning a review of Ordnance Survey prices to see whether a trading fund has had an adverse effect on prices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Preliminary findings from Dr. Robinson's review indicate that the key trends that will affect Ordnance Survey in the future will be continuing wider availability, commoditisation and use of information technology; increased pressure to make public information widely and easily available; and stronger regulation through legislation to ensure free and fair competition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Against that background and the signing of the national interest mapping service agreement, Dr. Robinson and his management board have concluded that it will be unsustainable to maximise profit as a long-term goal. Instead, they propose to maximise the utilisation of data and mapping while still making a small profit to cover trading fund obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As part of the prior options review in 2001, I will be commissioning a review of Ordnance Survey to see how the policy of maximising utilisation of data and mapping within a Trading Fund environment has affected prices. I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.37 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Key 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Salisbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Committee for allowing me to add my support for the measure. Several of my constituents work for Ordnance Survey. My personal interest in that remarkable organisation goes back many years and I have an important question to ask the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I first visited Ordnance Survey back in 1962 and I have watched with great admiration as it has evolved since then. My last visit was only a few weeks ago. Some people play golf, I read maps. I learned to read maps at my father's knee—give me a map and I am a happy man. I have enjoyed many hours of harmless fun reading maps, which I recommend to Members of Parliament who are seeking to stay out of harm's way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most recent maps are truly remarkable, and I commend Ordnance Survey for the speed with which they are produced. When I did the politically correct thing and moved my family to a new residence on a brownfield site in central Salisbury, within a year, the building was on the latest Ordnance Survey 1:150,000 map, a truly remarkable achievement. Only on Monday, I was at Old Sarum with representatives from Ordnance Survey considering ways of celebrating the millennium, and looking at the original 1796 triangulation baseline from Old Sarum to Beacon Hill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
I maintain a continuing interest in the future of the Organisation. However, I am concerned that Ordnance Survey should not go down the American route of selling the family silver in pursuit of providing national access to all the information that it holds. I understand that, as there is virtually no copyright on any of the material in the United States, there is no revenue stream that the authorities can use to replicate the remarkable progress of Ordnance Survey.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will assure me that Ordnance Survey will not go down the American route and that it will always retain, through copyright or other means, the information that allows it to generate sufficient, although not excessive, revenue. That revenue will allow Ordnance Survey to address the challenges of new technology and the new uses and demands that many millions of people put on the excellent Ordnance Survey maps.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.40 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Joan Walley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no intention of detaining the Committee. I am sure that the Minister is aware that today in the Chamber we debated the report of the Environmental Audit Select Committee on greening government. In view of the performance target that will be set for the new trading fund, it is appropriate to explore what thought has been given to the objectives of sustainable development. To put the environment at the heart of all Government policies, it is vital that when we establish new agencies such as this one, with new terms of reference, proper regard is given to sustainable development if we are not to have bolt-on additions. I should like the Minister to assure me on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.41 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intend to be brief. The Committee will be pleased to learn that I shall not be using information that has been provided by my daughter. She has not briefed me in advance; she does not even know that I am on the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a great fan of Ordnance Survey, which one usually associates with paper maps for walking. The only recent comments that I have heard on it relate to electronically held information, which is of great importance. The Minister will know that I am involved with Pitcom, the parliamentary information technology committee and the European Infomatics Market Group, which examine the availability of electronic information. I am afraid that some companies are not fans of Ordnance Survey. They are critical of the release and cost of information. The cost is particularly important for local authorities because they want to establish systems that are based on geographical information, which is an expanding sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the Minister's opinion of that? He confirmed that the industry had made adverse comment on the use of information. If Ordnance Survey remains a Government monopoly, it might be referred to European agencies or courts for not releasing information. Can the Government continue to give preferential treatment to Ordnance Survey in the light of European regulations? The previous Government demonstrated that where there was a national interest; that it was right to have an
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0264">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
arm's-length relationship with an organisation. Where organisations are privatised but still act within the national interest, the Government can go to other organisations if they are unhappy with the commercial rate that is being charged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How does the Minister see matters progressing? Will the United Kingdom continue to lead the field in many of these technologies? Will he bear it in mind that if an organisation is replaced by a Government agency, it will work at the pace of a Government agency rather than an organisation that is fully free of the Government's stranglehold?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.44 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Burns 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Chelmsford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the Committee that I shall be brief. I associate myself with the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury (Mr. Key). I wholeheartedly concur with his comments about the tremendous work that Ordnance Survey does and the pleasure and information that its surveys provide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want briefly to ask the Minister two questions, which I hope he will be able to respond to equally briefly. The first relates to the reorganisation and the impact that the order will have on Ordnance Survey and its ability to carry out its duties and functions in future. The question arises from the press release that it published on 22 January, highlighting and trailing our Committee proceedings today. In the first paragraph, Ordnance Survey says that it
	<br><blockquote><p>"is mapping out an internal reorganisation of its operations to give a sharper focus to strategic, operational and staffing issues."</p></blockquote>
What impact will that reorganisation have on those crucial areas?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the press release goes on to say that the changes made in the order
	<br><blockquote><p>"will give Ordnance Survey greater responsibilities for its finances and planning while remaining in the public sector."</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister tell us how those responsibilities will help finances and planning and what the implications will be on prices to the customer? Clearly the Opposition will not oppose the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.46 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a short but useful and interesting debate, in which a number of points have been raised by several hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Salisbury gave the proposals an enthusiastic welcome and revealed himself to be an aficionado of mapping. I do not intend to pursue him into the highways and byways of Wiltshire or any other area, armed with an Ordnance Survey map. I brought a couple with me in case anyone should inquire, but I discover that I have 112 in the Explorer range, which is to the west of the hon. Gentleman, and 151 in the Landranger range, which is to the north of him. Therefore, I cannot test whether his observation about the speed of updating in Salisbury is correct. I am delighted to hear that his home
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
was incorporated within 12 months. I have checked in relation to my constituency and I am pleased to say that the dome features on the latest Ordnance Survey map, so it is truly up to date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about selling the family silver. I assure him that it is no part of our objective to follow the American trend. We have a different approach. Ordnance Survey rightly has an unparalleled reputation for quality, which is vital to its future success. We intend to maintain that reputation. It would be a mistake to pursue an approach that subordinates everything to commercial considerations. It will be clear to the hon. Gentleman why we have chosen the trading fund route rather than pursue the possibility of privatisation that was considered by the previous Government—but not adopted as a policy, I am pleased to say. That would have been inappropriate for a service such as Ordnance Survey, which must balance public responsibilities and interest with commercial acumen. We hope that, with the trading fund, we have achieved the correct balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Ms Walley) raised the important issue of sustainability. Ordnance Survey's service is vital to that process. It already acts on issues crucial to sustainable development. It is playing a key role in the development of the national land use database, which will identify brownfield sites appropriate for development and make it easier to pursue our objective of concentrating development in urban areas on brownfield sites. Therefore, Ordnance Survey is an agency that contributes significantly, and will go on doing so, to the objective of planning and development sustainability. To answer the more important part of the hon. Lady's focus, it also has its own internal environmental officer and environmental policy to ensure that its approach is environmentally sustainable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for South Dorset (Mr. Bruce) referred to the availability of information, particularly electronically-held information, and suggested that Ordnance Survey was a Government monopoly. It is not. Its only monopoly has been its involvement in uneconomic mapping of national significance. There is no formal monopoly and any other organisation is free to compete, but because of Ordnance Survey's quality, it is not surprising that it has a strong market position. It deserves that position and we hope that it will be able to maintain it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ordnance is highly sensitive to its position as a market leader—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I acknowledge that Ordnance Survey is not a monopoly according to the meaning of the word in the English language, but under European legislation it would count as a monopoly because of its market dominance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Be that as it may, its market dominance is based on quality. I would not want our national mapping agency to subordinate its standards to those that apply in some European countries in which the mapping service is not of the same quality. To do that to break a monopoly would be entirely inappropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0265">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
I have stressed that Ordnance Survey has no formal monopoly. It operates in a free market which any other mapping Organisation may enter. I am confident that Ordnance Survey will be able to meet any such challenge head on because of its tradition of efficiency and quality. I hope that we can maintain that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On access to information, Ordnance Survey is sensitive to its position as the market leader. There have been difficult negotiations with a number of firms, including one in the constituency of the hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman). She has been involved in those negotiations, and I am glad to say that there has been considerable progress in the past month. I believe that that long-running dispute may now be well on the way to resolution.

Dr. Robinson, the director general of Ordnance Survey, is conscious of his responsibility to ensure that Ordnance Survey uses its considerable resources to proper effect and that it does not sell itself short. Its valuable assets required considerable investment to acquire and we do not want to undervalue the quality of its information. Dr. Robinson is equally conscious that that information must be made available on appropriate terms to organisations with a legitimate interest. My discussions with Dr. Robinson in the six months since he was appointed have suggested that the way forward for Ordnance Survey is to become more effectively involved in the sharing of information in the age of electronic information to maximise its input and considerable assets and at the same time give it a fair return.

The hon. Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) asked a couple of questions about internal reorganisation. That has been undertaken by Dr. Robinson with a view to creating a more streamlined, efficient organisation that can focus more on the objective of developing Ordnance Survey's product range and ensuring that it is capable of marketing its products more effectively. Dr. Robinson is right to undertake that reorganisation. It will give a new focus to the operation and take forward the considerable work done by his predecessor, Dr. David Rhind, who is greatly admired and gave considerable service during his period as director general of Ordnance Survey. I believe that Dr. Robinson will continue that considerable achievement with distinction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The review of the internal reorganisation has not been completed and it would be wrong for me to anticipate its conclusions. I have given the hon. Gentleman a fair assessment of the objectives of the new director general, who has been in post for only six months. They are to sharpen up the organisation's management, ensure successful development of its products and sell them in the market place in the years ahead.

On prices and finances, I have responded to the concerns expressed in some quarters about pricing policy. I have shared with the Committee my discussions with Dr. Robinson, which were designed to ensure that Ordnance Survey maximises use of its assets and achieves a fair return without abusing its position as market leader. That is the right approach for the organisation to pursue and I hope that it will do so.

We are justly proud of the achievements of Ordnance Survey, and we are keen to continue the tradition of mapping and geographic information that meets the need of a wide range of customers at a price that gives them and the taxpayer excellent value for money. A trading fund environment will ensure that Ordnance Survey discharges its responsibilities in the most cost-effective way for all concerned.

Ordnance Survey will report its progress in its annual report and accounts, a publication which has consistently been placed in the top three in agency competitions in recent years. The principles of quality in operations and staff development will continue to take high priority within an organisation that is already ISO 9000, Investors in People and Chartermark accredited across all its operations.

I believe that the third century of Ordnance Survey's existence will be even more successful than the first two. I wish the director general and his staff well as they move to trading fund status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
