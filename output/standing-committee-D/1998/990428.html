	<div class='legislation'>Draft European Parliamentary Elections (Northern Ireland) (Amendment) Regulations 1999</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. PauI Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft European Parliamentary Elections (Northern Ireland) (Amendment) Regulations 1999.</p></blockquote>
The background to the order concerns the European elections legislation that the House considered some time ago. As members of the Committee will know, the method in Great Britain by which European Members of Parliament are elected is now different, in that they will be elected on a regional list system. In Northern Ireland, however, the system that has been used for some time for obvious reasons is the single transferable vote under which Northern Ireland is treated as a single constituency. The House has already decided that the STV system will remain in Northern Ireland and that three Members will be elected under that system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now explain several technical, detailed amendments that were made when the changes were made in Great Britain and which now apply to Northern Ireland. The European Parliamentary Elections Act 1999 changed some of the terminology applicable to all European parliamentary elections in the United Kingdom. Consequently, references to European "parliamentary constituencies" and "representatives" no longer exist. Such descriptions will be amended to "electoral regions" and "Members of the European Parliament". Incidentally, no alteration will be made by the regulations to the existing mechanism for triggering a by-election or associated electoral procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee will know that that is not the case in Great Britain. It now has a different system for by-elections, because they relate to substitutes in a regional list system. That will not apply to Northern Ireland; if a by-election is created there, the present system will continue and an ordinary by-election will be held.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another change is that the regulations made under the Registration of Political Parties Act 1998 will now apply to Northern Ireland. As for section 93 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 and the legislation for the Northern Ireland Assembly elections, which prohibit broadcast media coverage of a constituency campaign issue without the consent of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
all the candidates within that constituency, such consent is not required to cover issues that are considered to be national.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I am sure the Committee will recognise, that distinction is often somewhat artificial, particularly given that, for the election, the whole of Northern Ireland is one constituency. It is impractical to seek the permission of all the candidates who may chose to stand in the electoral region—in this case, Northern Ireland. For the provision not to apply will make practical sense and will, for the elections, bring Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also amending section 75 of the Representation of the People Act 1983. The Act limits the amount of expenditure not approved by an election agent, but which can be incurred by a third party during an election—in other words, when a body other than the candidate or his or her party incurs expenditure. The 1983 Act limited that amount to £5. As the provision applied to parliamentary elections, it was found to be in breach of article 10 of the European convention on human rights and it was the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the Bowman case that the low limit on such spending placed an unjustified restriction on freedom of expression. We have therefore increased the sum for Northern Ireland from £5 to £5,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a reason for that increase. The Neill committee suggested a limit of £500 for each parliamentary constituency. Northern Ireland has 18 parliamentary constituencies, but Wales has 14 and some regions in England, Wales and Scotland have as few as 10. However, as the sum of £5,000 will be applied for the purposes of that election in all the regions of Great Britain, it makes sense that the same sum should apply in Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Londonderry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the £5,000 be equitably spread over the varying populations of the regions in Great Britain, or will there be a wide variation, depending on electoral numbers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a wide variation in England, Scotland and Wales. As I said, many of the electoral regions in England are differently composed to the electoral regions in Wales. There are 14 in Wales and 10 in the north-west of England; Northern Ireland has 18, so there is no exact equivalence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dale Campbell-Savours 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is correct, does it mean that the figure per head of population will be less in some regions than in others?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but we are not referring to ordinary electoral expenses. We are referring to expenses that can be incurred by third parties. For example, the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children can spend that money supporting or not supporting a candidate in a particular constituency where it could previously spend only £5, even though the agent for the candidate would not have been involved in such spending or policy making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0363">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
The European court has said that the £5 limit was an infringement of human rights, and it has consequently been changed. The figure in Britain has been determined at £5,000. It makes sense to have a similar determination for Northern Ireland. In the Northern Ireland context, for example, organisations that are not political parties could support either pro or anti-agreement candidates in the election to the European Parliament. They would therefore be bound by the new rule and not the rule that would allow them to spend only £5—a rule that today seems rather strange.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basic figure of £500 for each Parliamentary constituency was recommended by the Neill committee, and I imagine that the £5,000 figure arose because many electoral regions in England have 10 members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to press my hon. Friend on the matter, but is there not a danger that a group of candidates could aggregate or pool each candidate's £5,000 to create an artificial position, and thus a separate campaign?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know how it will run. This is the first time that the recommendation has been followed. We shall have to see what happens. For instance, I know that were my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, South (Mr. Gapes) allowed to speak, he could give an example of a trade union that wanted to back one of my party's candidates about 20 years ago. For various policy reasons, the Labour candidate did not want the backing of that trade council. However, because the agent decided that the party did not want such backing, the issue went to court. It is that sort of thing that the regulations seek to avoid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister must by now have had the opportunity to read the yesterday's proceedings in the other place, where my noble Friend, Lord Molyneaux raised that very question. Is the Minister yet able to tell the Committee that any number of individuals could put up £5,000? It is not a question of 10 candidates being able to pool 10 times £5,000, but of individuals, constituents and members of the public not involved in the election—one, five, 10, or even 50 of them—each being able to put up £5,000. Does not that matter deserve the most serious consideration? If I can catch your eye later, Mr. Winterton, I hope to expand on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that when the hon. Gentleman has expanded on that, towards the end of the debate, I shall be able to answer some of those questions in detail. As a member of the Ulster Unionist party, does he agree in general that we do not want a great difference between the regulations for Belfast and those for Cardiff, Edinburgh and London? I accept the general point, and shall return to it. The change is not of our volition but is a consequence of a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
To bring them up to date, the regulations reflect an inflationary increase on the 1994 figures from £13,175 to £14,900 per candidate and 5·7p to 6·4p per elector. They contain nothing else of note, and I am perfectly happy to answer questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.40 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Moss 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Cambridgeshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee has already begun to gnaw on the cancerous bone at the heart of the regulations, which are madness. The Minister does not have the answers, although he is hoping to receive some from his team. Yesterday, in the other place, Lord Dubs could not answer the question asked by Lord Molyneux, either.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a most sinister development. All democrats—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is worried about my being sinister, I shall put a stop to that straight away by saying that, on the question of freedom of expression, no limit is placed on the number of people who may spend £5,000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was right in that the answer came from the Minister's team. He is right. There was a European ruling, the Bowman judgment, which, as the hon. Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Ross) will remember, involved the SPUC. In April 1992, a Mrs. Bowman distributed 1.5 million SPUC leaflets in constituencies throughout the United Kingdom. The case specifically related to the 25,000 leaflets distributed in Halifax. The judgment was upheld on a technicality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to read the Neill report in that context. The Minister alluded to the fact that the Neill report recommended a limit of £500. Significantly, however, paragraph 10·63 of the section in the Neill report that refers to the Bowman case states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is relevant to note that section 75"—</p></blockquote>
of the Representation of the People Act 1983—
	<br><blockquote><p>"is confined to activities which are intended to promote or prejudice the electoral prospects of 'particular candidates in a particular constituency'. Leaflets designed merely to bring factual information to the attention of voters or to assist a national campaign without referring to particular candidates fall outside the section."</p></blockquote>
I did not use the word "sinister" lightly. This seems to afford people rights, individually and collectively, to embark on a negative personal campaign against someone—not only in European elections; presumably, it will also apply to parliamentary elections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless constraints are imposed—which the regulations do not contain and to which the Neill report does not allude—we shall face a serious predicament. The maximum that a parliamentary candidate may spend is about £8,000. At £500 a throw, we need only 16 people in a parliamentary constituency to be spending as much as the parliamentary candidate promoting his party and its policies and manifesto.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is insidious because if someone purports to distribute leaflets that support a different policy from that of the main parties, he or she cannot have the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0364">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
money, but if a person sets out to attack someone personally, he or she will receive it. Why have the Government let the proposal through?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Neill suggested £500, but that did not have to be the figure. In paragraph 10·59, which deals with the European ruling, the report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The judges observed that there may be circumstances in which the right of freedom of expression and the right to enjoy a free election may come into conflict and it may be considered necessary, in the period preceding or during an election, to place certain restrictions, of a type which would not usually be acceptable, on freedom of expression, in order to secure the 'free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of legislature.'"</p></blockquote>
That seems to give a green light to the Government to say, "Hold on a minute. If we take this to its logical conclusion, we end up with a potentially dangerous situation." Why have the Government not built in a failsafe which would in certain circumstances mitigate against the
	<br><blockquote><p>"free expression of the people in the choice of the legislature."</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 10.59 of the report continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In striking the balance between these two rights each Contracting State had a 'margin of appreciation', meaning thereby that each State is (within reasonable limits) entitled to adopt the solution which best suits its circumstances and traditions."</p></blockquote>
There is the get-out. The Government do not have to introduce the proposal. Each contracting state, each member of the European Court of Human Rights, can decide what is best with regard to how it runs its own elections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall make two points. First, there is a margin in the European legislation, so we do not have to follow everyone else; we have freedom of action, best judged on how we do things. Secondly, the recommendation of £500 for a parliamentary constituency has been aggregated to £5,000 for European constituencies, but the Minister has not told us whether the £5,000 limit applies to European elections in Great Britain—in England, Scotland and Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it does.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister confirms that it does. So each individual can spend £5,000 to attack particular candidates. Individuals will have access to substantial amounts of money. I repeat that this is not a pro-Europe or an anti-Europe policy; we are talking about attacking candidates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should rethink the order. I have not voted against many orders in my time, but today we should lay down a marker that the regulations could be highly dangerous. I suppose that by making an issue of this today, it will perhaps enter the public domain and more people will begin to use the facilities. However, until the Minister adequately explains why enormous sums could be allocated to individuals who wish to destroy people's candidacies for European parliamentary elections, I, for one, in discussion with my Whip, may well vote against the regulations. Why is the figure so high?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that this matter should not be party political; it extends right across the House. I say that in all seriousness. If the Minister will listen to me, he will understand that this is a very dangerous issue. It was not until my noble Friend Lord Molyneaux brought it to our attention yesterday that we started to look into it, and we are deeply concerned about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely the sentiments that the hon. Gentleman expresses. This is not a party political issue—of course, it is not, because the proposal will enable all sorts of cranks to attack candidates of all parties. I do not know where the proposal has come from—perhaps the Minister and his team have replicated a measure that was passed through Parliament without being scrutinised in the right way, but the Minister has not confirmed that.

It would seem that the limit was raised from £5 to £100 in the Northern Ireland Assembly elections. Who decided that? I think that it was done because it seemed like a reasonable figure. It has now gone from £100 to £5,000 for individual constituencies in Northern Ireland. In the parliamentary sense, it will apparently be £500, although the legislation may not have been transferred across to parliamentary elections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position is serious. I know that European elections are looming, but I suggest that the Minister, unless he can give us satisfaction, takes the matter away and asks those in his Government to rethink it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Londonderry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope to return to what was said by the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss), who spoke for Her Majesty's Opposition, but there are some other issues in the regulations that we should consider as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The statutory instrument is largely technical, as the Minister suggested, but it does perpetuate the gerrymandering introduced in 1979 by the proportional representation system in Northern Ireland. In the Minister's opening remarks, he said that that system was used in Northern Ireland for obvious reasons, but he did not spell out what they were. Therefore, perhaps those on the Committee who once knew and those who have never been told should be reminded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the terms that prevailed at the time in regard to elections to Europe, Northern Ireland was entitled to two seats only in the European assembly. That was deliberately increased to three seats, and proportional representation was introduced to ensure that a representative from the minority nationalist population was elected. It was blatant gerrymandering—let there be no mistake about that. The Social Democratic and Labour party was the chosen party at that time. Now it is being strongly challenged by Sinn Fein for that seat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The longer I live through politics the more I find that when things are done for the wrong reason—and that change from the United Kingdom law was made for a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0365">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
wrong reason—eventually they end in tears. I was one of the few, even in my own party, who were prepared to say that we would have been far better with only the two seats. We were howled down not only by Labour, but by every party in the House when we drew attention to the gerrymandering that had taken place. That background has brought us to where we are today with three seats in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to move on to some of the technical issues. The description of Northern Ireland as an "Assembly constituency" will be replaced by the term "electoral region" by regulation 4(b), and the representative will become what is described, as has been elsewhere for a long time, as an MEP.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The schedule shows how the new ballot paper will look. It would be interesting to me, and I hope to all of us, to discover whether the Liberal Democrats, who were such a feature of an election or two in Great Britain, will find a means of circumventing the protection that has now been invented for all party names and symbols.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As it happens, I am one of those representing my party—it is all-party representation—on the Home Office working party on electoral law, which, as the Minister will be aware, talked about the matter a great deal. There is no easy answer or way to protect party symbols and names, as we all know. The system that has been introduced for the European election is the best shot that people can take at the moment. I am always certain that ingenious minds will find a way around such legislation to try to undermine parties, so although this is the best shot, it is not the end of it— more will come down the road.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not clear whether the symbols will be in glorious technicolour or whether we will have to be satisfied with the grey monochrome of old-time photographs. Emblems such as the red rose, the torch and our own symbol of the Union Jack in the shape of Northern Ireland are all in colour. If they are printed in black and white, they will lose something. So could we be told whether they will be in colour, which would, no doubt, produce difficult printing problems for those who print the ballot papers?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like an assurance on one thing in particular; that, when the ballot papers are printed, it will be possible to read the writing under, in or around the symbols, because I have great difficulty reading that writing as it is printed in the order. I hope that the standard of printing for the ballot papers will be somewhat higher.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister clarify the position of independents? If they want to run for election under a certain symbol, will they have to turn themselves into representatives of a political party, which is not difficult? Will they have to register themselves as a party or can an individual register a symbol? In addition, if they must do those things, what is the time limit? Folk would like to know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To turn to the sums expendable by candidates, do the new sums accurately reflect inflation? I hope that they do. The sums allowed in Northern Ireland are considerable. I worked it out on the basis of 1.1 million electors at 6.4p a head. It worked out that candidates
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
could spend £70,400, plus the £14,900 that individuals can spend as they please. That makes a total of £85,000 per candidate, and that is a minimum because there are actually more than 1.1 million electors. I do not think that many candidates in Northern Ireland or the United Kingdom will spend that much, but it is a measure of the sums that candidates can throw away in an election if they want to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also wish to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that, in replying to the debate in the other place last night, his noble Friend Lord Dubs said that the system of first past the post would apply to by-elections. That is wrong. That is not how a single transferable vote by-election works. It would only be first past the post if one individual received 50 per cent. plus one of the votes cast. Otherwise, one must go through the procedure of redistributing the votes from the bottom until someone passes the 50 per cent. threshold. I put that on the record in case the noble Lord's speech confuses anyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was also interested in the comments that were made about the broadcasting element. The Committee will be aware of the long-running row between the broadcasting authorities and, in particular, the minor parties, over the right to broadcast throughout the United Kingdom. To put it briefly, because I do not want to weary the Committee with unnecessary detail, the three major parties have no problem getting UK-wide broadcasts, but, as regional parties, the Scottish Nationalists, Plaid Cymru, the Ulster Unionist Party, the Social Democratic and Labour Party, the Democratic Unionist Party and any other party you care to name, will be restricted to its own region. However, the question of the unity of this kingdom extends beyond the borders of Northern Ireland, Wales, England and Scotland, and concerns every citizen. If people want to make a case which is vital to the whole nation, they should be allowed to do so and not be restricted to their own region, even if it has a greater bearing on the region than elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The broadcasting element should be kept in mind, not just for the forthcoming election, but for future reference. Election matters are not usually contentious across parties. Electoral law concerns every hon. Member and it is our duty to ensure that it is fair to everyone and that it operates in favour of none. I am sure that every hon. Member accepts that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point concerns the increase in third party election expenses from £5 to £5,000. The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire drew attention to the matter. The increase was introduced because of the activities of Mrs. Bowman, who is not known to any hon. Member. She and her organisation are prolific producers of paperwork on abortion matters. It does not matter whether one agrees with the lady, but she found a loophole in the law and she and her group went through it. They all wound up in court and she got off on a technicality because the summons was issued out of time. She then went to the European Court of Human Rights, which made an interesting judgment. The Government decided to do something about it. The willingness of Governments, time after
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0366">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
time, to do something instead of first thinking through what should be done leads to a lot of grief for the House and the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter requires a lot more thought than has been given to it so far. It cuts across parties and is fundamental to our democracy. We should not simply pass regulations and go away and forget about them. The Minister said earlier that we cannot ignore the matter and that the regulations must be passed. I understand that the limit applies also to European elections in Great Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the position. The European Court of Human Rights allowed a coach and horses to be driven through a sensible restriction that this nation has long placed on individual candidates. The principle was that outsiders were allowed to spend only 50p, which was later raised to £5. That was to protect candidates from prosecution if some fool spent a few pounds on them during an election, but the European judgment has turned that principle on its head and outsiders may now attack a candidate comprehensively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point raised by the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) on the different sizes of the electorate is also valid. Mrs. Bowman went to the European Court of Human Rights and others will do the same on the issue of unfair treatment in different electorates.They will win. That may happen not in this election but in a subsequent election, and the sum involved may be £500, which applies to United Kingdom elections; or £5,000, which applies to European elections. Various odds and sods—one, two, three, four, five or 100 of them—may allegedly be prepared to put up £5,000 to attack any Committee member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not hold with the American idea that spending more money on an election makes one certain to win it. Spending more money may help, but not as much as the Americans think. However, the ability to buy time can have a great effect on the outcome of elections. One could buy time oneself, or someone could buy time on one's behalf, and he might attack another candidate rather than help one directly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Committee members who are interested in this subject should get hold of the Neill report—most of us will have picked it up, but most of us will not have had time to read it—and they should turn to the section that deals with limits on campaign expenditure. They should begin reading it somewhere near paragraph 10·51, and they should read all of the section that is entitled,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Implications of the Bowman judgment".</p></blockquote>
I confess that I have not had time to read all of it—I managed to get my hands on the report only today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 10.59 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The judges observed that there may be circumstances in which the right of freedom of expression and the right to enjoy a free election may come into conflict".</p></blockquote>
Those rights do indeed come into conflict; there is no doubt about that. Paragraph 10.59 continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In striking the balance between these two rights each Contracting State had a 'margin of appreciation' … meaning
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
thereby that each State is (within reasonable limits) entitled to adopt the solution which best suits its circumstances and traditions."</p></blockquote>
The solution that best suits our circumstances and traditions involves the present arrangements—we support a figure not of £5,000 or of £500 but of, perhaps, £50. If we go beyond the minimum we will open a can of worms, and we may live to regret that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 10.60 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The majority concluded that, because the restriction in section 75 was set as low as £5, in practical terms it operated a total barrier on Mrs. Bowman's publishing information with a view to influencing the voters of Halifax in favour of an anti-abortion candidate."</p></blockquote>
How does that statement relate to the electoral law on a third party's attempts to influence the electorate during an election campaign? The paragraph continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It was, therefore, out of proportion to the legitimate aim it sought to achieve."</p></blockquote>
That suggests that the judges thought that there was a proportion, which is, as I have already said, very low.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 10.61 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The immediate effect of 	<i>Bowman</i> is that it will be necessary for the United Kingdom legislature to amend section 75"—</p></blockquote>
of the Representation of the People Act 1983—
	<br><blockquote><p>"so as to raise the limit on expenditure above £5."</p></blockquote>
That is what we want to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 10.64 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We suggest for consideration by the Government that the amended figure to be inserted in section 75(1)(ii) should be more than £100 and should be of the order of £500."</p></blockquote>
This is a serious issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 10.69 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"in the dissenting judgment of Judges Loizou, Baka and Jambrek"—</p></blockquote>
I hope that I have pronounced their names correctly—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(who held that the spending limit was not disproportionate) it was stated that 'There can be no doubt that limits on election campaign spending maintain equality of arms as between candidates, a most important principle in democratic societies and in the electoral process.'"</p></blockquote>
The £5,000 sum will create inequality between candidates. The Government should, therefore, seriously reconsider the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 10.70 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We do not think that the majority would have disagreed with this sentiment"—</p></blockquote>
the sentiment that was expressed by the three judges—
	<br><blockquote><p>"It was the derisory limit of £5 to which they objected."</p></blockquote>
There is a great deal more, but I shall leave it to hon. Members to go away and consider the matter. I hope that the Government Whip who is in Committee today will take on board my comments. I sincerely believe that we are going down an extremely dangerous path that we should leave as soon as possible. We may not be able seriously to reconsider the matter before the forthcoming election, but we should do so before voters go to the polls in a year's time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Therefore, this is our first realistic opportunity to comment on these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Did my right hon. Friend the Minister demonstrate any flexibilty in the matter? Given the implications for the matters that we have discussed, could we in any way have challenged the judgment and not proceeded with the regulation? Was there room for flexibility on the figure of £5,000? Were we required to introduce that figure for a particular reason? Might we have arrived at a lesser figure, and if we had, would it have resulted in further legal challange? I am sorry that I was unable to give my right hon. Friend notice of those questions, but I did not know the issue that we were to debate until I entered Committee this afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am slightly worried about the danger of abuse. My right hon. Friend will be aware of the problems relating to the future of the European Union and those people with lots of money who are prepared to use every available devide to influence election results. I am fearful that the regulations appear to allow one such person to abuse his position and secure aggregate influence by involving a number of people in election campaigning. Might the matter be kept under review, so that the Government can further regulate against abuse, should it arise?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lembit Öpik 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not surprising for Liberal Democrats to support anything that will introduce fair votes and proportional representation. Uniquely, we have supported such proposals for a very long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right to try to deal with the opportunity that is presented to spoiling candidates, such as the Literal Democrats, to whom reference was made a few minutes ago. It is widely accepted that, in the 1994 European elections, the Literal Democrats cost the Liberal Democrats a seat in the European Parliament. It is important that that sort of spoiling tactic should not be allowed to carry on wrecking the legitimate political endeavours of those who are trying to participate constructively in the electoral process in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
the UK. Interestingly, in north Wales, a Conservatory party candidate stood against a Conservative. On being challenged about his motive, he said, "I think everyone should have a conservatory." That did not strike me as a plausible justification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point is a small one, but something I wish to raise on behalf of the Alliance party of Northern Ireland. It is a shame that the Alliance party was not included in the example. I am sure that it was a perfectly innocent oversight and no sign of discrimination against that worthy organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also want to mention the £5,000 limit in respect of unauthorised third-party activity. The issues have already been described in detail, but that that is the sort of situation that results when legislation is put together piece by piece. I understand that the tactical problem has arisen, to some extent, because the regulations are designed to restrict unauthorised activity. That is a problem and a balance must be struck. However, we must remember that the political system does not just exist for us, as party politicians, to ply our trade by limiting the voice of organisations who stand to support or oppose us. To that extent, we must tread carefully in any such discussion and not simply consider the point of view of party politicians, which we all are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, for example, some shady organisation such as the Armagh observatory or the Northern Ireland Estonian community sought to lend its support to a particular candidate in Northern Ireland, it should be entitled to put more than £5 into that support. By and large, organisations that support or oppose candidates do so for entirely legitimate reasons, whether or not one agrees with them. Therefore, I urge caution in assuming that a spending limit of some sort is entirely wrong, but I tend to side with the view expressed by previous speakers that £5,000 is a little too high.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, I do not feel that I can vote against the order because it is also imperative to ensure the equalisation of Northern Ireland and UK legislation, so we end up with a larger problem. I would very much like to have an assurance from the Minister that he will take this matter back to those who are in a position to revise the spending limits for third parties for the whole of the UK, rather than just for Northern Ireland. In that context, we need to have a further discussion at a future date to lower that figure. However, for now, although I am unhappy with the amount, it is right that we should equalise the expenditure limit for third parties—by which I do not mean the Liberal Democrats but third parties unauthorised by the agents of other candidates—and I hope that the Minister will give us an assurance that he will take on board the serious concerns of hon. Members of all parties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Sayeed 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Mid-Bedfordshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intend to confine my remarks to the vexing problem of the £5,000 limit. The Government are right to react to the Bowman judgment. However, I believe that, in drafting the legislation, the Government should have taken notice of the minority judgment. We know that,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0368">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
in elections, money talks—sometimes very loudly. The order sets a precedent that is likely to be followed in normal parliamentary constituency elections. As the Bowman judgment related to a parliamentary constituency election, it will clearly have to be followed in the elections of all of us here today. But it sets an extremely dangerous precedent because, as other hon. Members have said, one of the great glories of the Representation of the People Act is that it limits the amount that each candidate can spend. It puts us on an equal footing in that respect, and there are severe penalties for the candidate who spends more than he is entitled to, and for his agent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can envisage how that limit, whether it is in Northern Ireland or in a Westminster constituency, might be abused. The system could be used not only to attack a candidate, but to support one. It is not just a question of one lot of £5,000—or, in the case of a Westminster parliamentary constituency, £500—it is as many lots of £5,000 or £500, as one wishes. I can envisage a candidate, who has perhaps done favours for those around him in the past, asking his friends not to put money into his own election campaign, but to use it to fund a campaign in support of him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to have to say to the Minister that this is a sloppy proposal, which will introduce not only bad law, but dangerous law. It is not a matter of shame for a Minister to admit that legislation put before the House, either in the Chamber or in Committee, may be deficient. If deficiencies are pointed out, any good Minister should be willing to take away the draft legislation to reconsider it. I understand that the Government have a problem, in that they have to react to a judgment of the European Court of Human Rights. However, the way in which they have reacted will considerably endanger democracy. That should be a matter of interest to anyone, of whatever political party.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Something that I did not comment on earlier was the fact that during the election campaign to the Northern Ireland Assembly last year, one particular side had considerable amounts of money raised and expended on its behalf.

The hon. Member for Workington asked the Minister to keep the matter under review, and to implement changes if there were abuses or problems. That may be too late. The precedent will have been set, an abuse will have taken place, and the election will have been distorted. It will be too late because the person will have been elected under the law as it was at the time. In a close election, or where there is an issue of considerable moment on which people want to spend a great deal of their own or others' money—to support a particular view or a particular group of candidates—the will of the people will be distorted. Keeping the matter under review and waiting to see what happens may mean that the abuse will have already taken place.

The hon. Gentleman referred to what he described as the gerrymandering of the European constituencies in Northern Ireland. Whatever his or others' views are on that, I have not the slightest doubt that the three Members of the European Parliament in Northern Ireland have worked together extremely well. They have worked as a team, despite coming from different political backgrounds, to do the best that they can in Northern Ireland. A good working spirit has developed as a consequence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman then referred to emblems and symbols, which are always difficult issues in Northern Ireland. The emblems will not be printed in colour but black and white. I looked at them while he was speaking, and I do not think there will be any doubt as to the difference between those of the DUP, SDLP, Sinn Fein, his own party or the United Kingdom Unionist party. The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. Öpik) might like to know that the Alliance party is not there because it had not registered when the order was drafted. As for the issue of printing, the clarity of the print is an important factor. I shall ensure that those points are brought to the attention of the chief electoral officer for Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sayeed</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I noted that, when the Minister looked at the order, he had to put his glasses on.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree. In my case, the problem is a result of advancing age.

As far as the Treasury figures are concerned, the inflation figure was checked with Her Majesty's Treasury. The hon. Member for East Londonderry

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
rightly referred to the question of by-elections, which will not use the first-past-the-post system but the STV system, as has been the case in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All Opposition Members and my hon. Friend the Member for Workington referred to the result of the Bowman case. That is not a precedent because the order before us is a result of reading across from Great Britain legislation. That is precisely why we consider this as a matter for the whole of the United Kingdom rather than as a special Northern Ireland matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figure itself looks large—it has increased from £5 to £5,000—but that is because Northern Ireland has a large electoral area for 1·5 million people. In this case, the £5,000 refers to activity by third parties to try to influence voters in a population of 1.5 million. The figure to which we should refer is the £500 for a parliamentary constituency, to which the figure of £5, in the first instance, referred. Why has the limit increased from £5 to £5,000? As I said to my hon. Friend the Member for Workington, we dealt with that matter for the Northern Ireland Assembly elections, where the limit was set at £100. It was increased in the light of the judgment and consequential recommendation by the Neill committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If that figure is not on the statute book, and it is merely a recommendation by Neill that we are not obliged to accept, why has it been unthinkingly increased to £5,000—and not merely for Northern Ireland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is true that we have yet to have an election involving a parliamentary constituency, and the Neill recommendation referred to the parliamentary constituency rather than the European electoral area. In England, an average European electoral area consists of 10 parliamentary constituencies. If one multiplies £500 by 10, one arrives at the figure of £5,000. I remind the hon. Gentleman that I acknowledged that there is a difference in respect of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reiterate the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Workington and the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mr. Sayeed) about keeping the matter under review. Clearly, it should be reviewed
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
properly in time for the next general election, and that is what my right hon. and hon. Friends in the Home Office will undoubtedly do. However, we are concerned with an imminent election and should leave the subject of the £5,000 limit, because that refers to very large areas. It is the £500 figure with which hon. Members of this Parliament should be concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Neill committee arrived at the figure of £500 on the basis that the Government would be subject to challenge in the European Court of Human Rights, or in our own courts when the Human Rights Bill receives Royal Assent, if there were an increase of, say, £5 to £20, or £20 to £50. Paragraph 10.64 of the Neill committee report states that the figure should be amended to £500 because, in an ordinary parliamentary constituency,
	<br><blockquote><p>"this would provide an allowance sufficient to cover, for example, the production and distribution of a leaflet throughout a constituency"—</p></blockquote>
that would not provide much in the way of leaflets for an average parliamentary constituency of 37,000 to 40,000 households—
	<br><blockquote><p>"or the publication of an advertisement in a local newspaper."</p></blockquote>
Neill argues—I agree—that, if we do not increase the figure to a reasonable level, we would be challenged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The significance of the judgment does not relate to decisions taken by the Government but, as the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire said, to our response to a court case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a good explanation. However, was that the lowest figure that we could arrive at without, according to legal advice, provoking a challenge?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before I allow the Minister to respond, I should say that there is likely to be a Division on the Floor of the House at any moment, and Committee members must decide whether they want to conclude their deliberations before that Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not mind. I can finish straight away. The question is whether Committee members are willing to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should say to the hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire and my hon. Friend the Member for Workington that the matter was one of judgment for the Neill committee, which took the view that the £500 figure seemed sensible. We have a safeguard, in that we intend to review the figure. If the matter needs to be reexamined, we shall do so. I share hon. Members' views on electoral expenses, but we must react to the court case and the figure seems reasonable. In a parliamentary constituency £500 does not go far, and we shall reconsider it in the context of general elections.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sayeed</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The matter is so important that if we must return to it, so be it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that £100 does not buy much, but five, seven or 10 times £500 buys quite a lot in a parliamentary constituency. Let us assume that someone such as the late James Goldsmith stands in a parliamentary constituency and prevails upon his

many rich friends to support him, not by campaigning for him, but by attacking his opponents. I understand that that would be permitted. If the law applying to European elections—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am a strict Chairman and I do not like major speeches being made during interventions. I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would bring his intervention to an end.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sayeed</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Winterton. You are correct to call me to order. Will the Minister confirm that many sums of £500 could be used together?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course. The purpose of the court ruling is to protect the rights of individuals. If the sum is as ludicrously low as £5, individuals have no right to do anything. I am not defending the court's judgment, but if we are to follow its ruling, £5 is simply not workable. We shall reconsider the figure, but it is important to accept the regulations to allow the elections to be held in Northern Ireland in six or seven weeks. We shall review the figure in the light of representations in time for the general election, but we must introduce the regulations now to cover the European elections.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has not satisfactorily replied to our questions, including those on cost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What cost?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The cost of £5,000 per individual in Northern Ireland is one. Who will pay for that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no allocation for which to pay. That is the limit up to which individuals may spend. There are certainly no public cost implications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have said that we shall review the matter before the general election, but we must press on with the regulations now to ensure that the forthcoming elections in Northern Ireland can be held.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the Government are prepared to reconsider the matter—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not this, but the general principle. That concerns me most, because it is very important. Is the Minister undertaking to reconsider the matter in the round and in the context of all elections, and will he
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
bring it before the Home Office committee considering electoral matters so that it can be thoroughly explored? The danger is that we are opening an avenue for abuse and corruption and we shall bitterly regret that if it is allowed to stand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that the Government would consider a review for future elections. Representations can be made to the Government, but I repeat that the change has been introduced by the Government, not of their own volition, but as the result of a court case. We must be careful to ensure that elections are not open to challenge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Cran 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beverley and Holderness)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear what is being said, but we want to establish how the Government came to their conclusion. The Minister has been very gracious, but he said that the Government had reached a reasonable figure to prevent the challenge that he feared. Opposition Members simply want to know what reasonable mean and what parameters led the Government to the figure of £5,000. I have listened patiently, but I have not heard that information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I explained why that figure was reasonable. It resulted from the Neill committee's recommendations and the amount of money that a court of law might reasonably expect anyone to spend on leaflets, and so on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
