I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income) (Ireland) Order 1998.</p></blockquote>
Good afternoon, Mr. Jones. I am pleased to introduce the order, which deals with a protocol that updates an existing treaty with Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I describe the treaty provisions, I hope that you will excuse me for congratulating the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) on his promotion to the Front Bench. This is the first Committee on double taxation in which he has led for the Opposition. I look forward to seeing him when we consider other double taxation treaties and when we debate the Finance Bill in the House. He has been assiduous in financial matters, and I am sure that he will continue to account admirably for himself, although you will excuse me for saying that I hope he does not do too admirably when he faces me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like our predecessors, the Government are committed to maintaining and, when circumstances permit, extending the United Kingdom network of double taxation agreements. Such agreements have enjoyed cross-party support for some time. The previous Government presided over the 100th treaty. It is not politically controversial to say that our double taxation treaties have been and will be very successful, and I hope that they continue to enjoy cross-party support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The business community, too, welcomes the agreements because they reduce tax-related barriers to international trade and investment and provide certainty of treatment in several ways. First, they reduce withholding tax on investment flows; secondly, they allocate taxing rights and thus prevent double taxation; and, thirdly, they provide a mechanism for tax authorities to resolve difficult cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The protocol with Ireland will, if approved, amend the double taxation convention between our two countries, which was signed in 1976 and which has been amended by two previous protocols. The convention generally follows the model text that was established by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which was in use when the convention was signed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The protocols make several changes to deal with the practical problems of operating some of the convention's provisions and to take account of changes in the two countries' tax systems. They cover five main areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
First, the present protocol provides for a building site or a construction or installation project to be regarded as a permanent establishment only if it exists for more than six months. Previously, the convention contained no such provision and a building site or construction project could constitute a permanent establishment from the outset. Thus, a UK-resident firm working on a construction project in Ireland could be liable to Irish tax on its profits even if the project lasted less than six months. That has caused UK firms problems in practice. The new rule will benefit UK contractors who seek to do business in Ireland at a time when the building industry there is booming. It will also give them greater certainty about their tax position in Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second protocol removes the payment of tax credits on dividends that go from one country to residents of another country. Ireland is abolishing tax credits on dividends next April, so UK residents would in any event receive no Irish tax credits on Irish dividends from next April. Dividends from one country to charities and pension funds that are resident in another will be exempt from tax on dividends in the source country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third protocol introduces tighter anti-avoidance provisions, aimed at countering arrangements intended to take advantage of the convention. Such an arrangement could consist of routing interest from the UK through Ireland to a third country to take advantage of the relief from UK tax under the convention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, the Government have used the order to bring capital gains rules closer to those in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development model text, and to permit the tax charge on gains made by people who left the UK for temporary residence abroad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fifthly, the protocol also brings rules for Government service remuneration and pensions closer to the OECD model. It deals specifically with a problem relating to the remuneration of teachers' pensions. Difficulties have occurred because of diverging decisions made by UK special commissioners and by the Irish High Court in appeal cases. Those decisions have widened the definition of Government service in the UK while narrowing the same definition in Ireland. Without an alteration to the convention, some teachers' remunerations would be exempt from tax in both the UK and Ireland, while former teachers' pensions would be taxed without relief in both countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The protocol has been negotiated at a time of increasingly close co-operation between the UK and Ireland, which is an important trading partner as well as a close neighbour. The protocol will help to ensure that the double taxation convention continues to encourage trade and investment between the two countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the order to the Committee, and I shall be happy to answer questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.37 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Gibb	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Financial Secretary for her kind words of welcome, and for her lucid and clear explanation of the order. I thank her also for continuing to follow the protocol of arranging for officials to supply a briefing to hon. Members before the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0359">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Double taxation treaties have genuine cross-party support. Often, such support spells impending doom, but the case for Britain's entry into bilateral treaties with other countries around the world to prevent different tax jurisdictions from taxing the same profit or income twice is unassailable. The prevention of double taxation encourages cross-border trade, and Britain has always been an international trading nation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The economic theory of comparative advantage has been an economic reality for Britain that has generated real wealth. That is why Britain has the largest network of double taxation treaties in the world, as the Financial Secretary said. We have treaties with more than 100 countries. As the hon. Lady pointed out, that figure was reached under the previous Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ireland is Britain's fifth largest trading partner. It is therefore vital that the double taxation treaty between the UK and Ireland is kept up to date. There is no question of the Opposition wanting to break cross-party consensus on the matter. We have serious concerns, however, about the Government's handling of treaty negotiations and about their nurturing of Britain's very valuable network of double taxation treaties and conventions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last July, the Government introduced legislation to end repayment of the tax credit on dividends to non-UK taxpayers and to pension funds. They also halved the tax credit by reducing it from 20 per cent, to 10 per cent. That change has profound consequences for double taxation treaties, as many of them contain provisions that enable overseas investors to reclaim the tax credit from the Inland Revenue when they receive dividends from UK companies. The double taxation treaty between the UK and Ireland enables residents of the Republic of Ireland to reclaim the credit on their dividends from UK companies, less a 15 per cent, withholding tax. When the credit was 20 per cent, it enabled a repayment—albeit a small one—to be made. But when the credit falls to 10 per cent, next year, it will be wiped out by the 15 per cent, withholding tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government did not simply abolish the tax credit in last July's Budget because doing so might have required a huge number of our double taxation treaties to be renegotiated, so reducing the figure to 10 per cent, was, they thought, a clever wheeze to save money in repayment without having to renegotiate all the treaties. However, that annoyed some of our treaty partners. Last July, we expressed concerns that halving the credit in such a way might threaten our treaty with the United States. The Paymaster General assured us that his Department had had discussions with the United States Government and that no retaliatory measures would be taken. On 1 October this year, the Treasury announced that the United Kingdom-United States double tax treaty is to be renegotiated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We now have before us an amendment to the United Kingdom-Republic of Ireland treaty that has been necessitated by two principal reasons: the change to the dividend tax credit, and the change to the permanent establishment article because of recent tax cases in the United Kingdom and Ireland over teachers' pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that unless the treaty passes all the legislative procedures during this calendar year, it will not be in force by 1 April next year. If it is not in force by
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
then, a huge loophole will be created when the new lower tax credit comes in next year. Irish pension funds and charities will be able to continue to reclaim tax credits without any withholding, leading to the development of a host of Irish-based investment products designed to exploit the loophole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The loophole arises because in the former treaty, charities and pension funds could reclaim the tax credit without any withholding. So reducing the credit to 10 per cent, would not render that repayment redundant, as it would in all other circumstances in which a 15 per cent, withholding tax exists. The loophole was created by the Government in their tax credit reforms; no such loophole existed before July 1997. We have another example of how Labour's first Budget has impacted on our double tax treaty network, requiring renegotiation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Financial Secretary answer these questions? First, will she confirm that unless the treaty is in place by the end of the year, a tax loophole will exist next year caused by the halving of the tax credit? Secondly, given that treaty renegotiations are, by necessity, carried out only once a generation per country, why has the treaty not adopted more extensively the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development model, which is what usually happens when treaties are renegotiated? Why, for example, is there no independent personal services article? Is it because of the rush—the need to get the treaty on to the books by the end of the year?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask my third question more out of curiosity than in a spirit of barbed criticism. Why is this protocol between the United Kingdom and the Government of Ireland, whereas the original treaty is between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland? Why is there a difference in wording? Has Ireland ceased to be a republic in the mean time, pending its inclusion in the Commonwealth?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, can the Minister explain why, in article 1 of the protocol, the new article 5(5) differs from the previous article 5(5) in the original treaty? Why will a building, construction or installation project that lasts for more than six months be a permanent establishment, when the period usually provided for in double tax treaties is 12 months?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fifthly, in article 2 of the protocol, can the Minister explain why paragraph 5 of article 11 has been removed? Sixthly, I refer to article III of the protocol, which is the old version of article 12—the interest article. The former article 12(5) of the treaty said that the treaty would not apply if the debt was created "mainly for the purposes" of using the treaty as a standard anti-avoidance provision. How does the new wording of article 12(5) change its meaning and why has it been changed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Seventhly, will the hon. Lady define the term "gains" in article 4 of the protocol, which relates to capital gains tax? How will it be distinguished from the phrase "capital gains", which is used in the old treaty? If there is no difference between the two terms, why has the change been made? Where is the word "gains" defined in UK tax legislation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
holding immovable properties that are situated in the alienator's country of residence; apparently, they are no longer given exclusively to that country. Did the Paymaster General have anything to say about that in discussions on the Finance Bill, given his particular interest in the transfer of shares?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention. I shall monitor the Financial Secretary's response to that, as well as to my other questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Eighthly, article V of the protocol deals with the problem of defining the term "public sector" in relation to public service pensions. I understand from what the hon. Lady said that the problem arose because the Irish High Court ruled that the pensions of higher education teachers were not covered by article 18, whereas the UK special commissioner said that they were. That would have meant that a UK resident receiving a pension after teaching in Ireland would be exempt from any tax both in Ireland and in the UK, whereas an irish resident receiving as similar pension from the UK would be taxed in both the UK and Ireland. Clearly, that is an unsustainable and unfair approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the same problem arises in regard to any pensions that are linked to activities that could be seen as apart of the Government. The uncertainty lies not just in relation to education service pensions but to pensions in any area on the fringe of direct central Government—the health service, for example, or marketing functions carried out on behalf of the state. Why did the Government not take the opportunity of clarifying those pensions, too? Why does article 18(3) refer only to educational institutions and not to all the other quasi-state institutions which may also give rise to future problems and contradictory cases? Is that yet another symptom of negotiations being rushed through in order to deal with the dividend tax credit loophole, which the Government created?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ninthly, why was article 18(3) repealed and not replaced? Tenthly—the Committee will be pleased to hear that his is the final point—why was income form the estates of deceased persons excluded from new article 20?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In April this year, the Inland Revenue published details of its priorities for double taxation treaties, and a long list followed: Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland Kazahkstan, Kuwait, Lithuania, Norway and Oman. The Revenue also expected to hold negotiations for new or updated treaties with Chile, the United Arab Emirates and the Netherlands. There are also on-going negotiations with Brazil. I note that there was no mention of the United States, so there was no consideration in April that the treaty with the United States would have to be renegotiated—it was not part of a routine, pre-planned renegotiation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus, with four months to go until the end of the financial year, only four of that long list of treaty plans have been completed: those with Kazahkstan, Hong Kong, Oman, and now Ireland. I understand the problems that the Government might be having in negotiating a treaty with Chile, thanks to the situation with General Pinochet,
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
which we all know about. But why the delay with the other treaties? Negotiating new and updating existing double taxation treaties—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am following the hon. Gentleman's speech carefully and I ask him closely to confine his remarks to the order under consideration?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Mr. Jones. However, I am making an important point: last year's dividend tax credit changes are causing problems with our double tax treaty network. The Ireland treaty is a classic example of that. It is vital to our trade that such treaties are updated, but this treaty has been rushed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I know that the hon. Gentleman is trying to adhere to the order that is under consideration by the Committee, but he is straying from it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make one final point about the review of double tax treaty relief. Will the Financial Secretary say when the report on that review is to be issued? Given that the double tax relief could raise £5.5 billion a year, will she assure the Committee that the review will be tax-neutral and that it will not result in any increase in tax revenue to the Government?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, the Government's stewardship of our double tax network is unsatisfactory. Answers are needed to the questions that I have posed, and I look forward to full responses from the Financial Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.50 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Burnett (Torridge and West Devon)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join the previous speakers in welcoming the protocol. We are a trading nation, and double taxation is an enemy of efficient overseas trade, as is the lack of certainty in tax treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask the Financial Secretary some additional questions. First, have the Government estimated the extent of the loss or gain to the Exchequer that will result from the protocol? If so, how much is that loss or gain?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, will the Financial Secretary clarify the Inland Revenue's policy on the exercising of their information powers under this double tax treaty and under double tax treaties in general? Are inquiries made only to other countries with which we have information-sharing agreements when there is prima facie evidence of fraud or evasion on a case-by-case basis?

Part of the protocol has been necessitated by the abolition of dividend tax credits in last year's Finance Act, which also had the effect of discriminating against hundreds of thousands of this country's poorest and most deprived citizens. During the Committee proceedings on the Finance Bill, the Paymaster General, the hon. Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson), commented that the Government would consider bringing forward provisions in next year's Finance Bill to make good the loss to those individuals who are least equipped to deal with it. This short debate could act as a timely reminder to the Financial Secretary that Opposition Members have not forgotten that commitment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am encouraged that the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett) has not forgotten that commitment. I am sure that he will also enjoy many of the discussions on the forthcoming Finance Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton asked me many questions, which I shall try to answer. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will respond if I fail to do so, or if he does not like my answers. If necessary, I shall of course write to him to clarify any unanswered questions. I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman asked 12 questions, not 10. He has them all in front of him, so that will be revealed in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The changes to tax credits are made in relation to both countries—that is, the changes that we have made in the UK and those that are about to be made in Ireland. The hon. Gentleman seems to be encouraging Committee members to think that there is currently a mad rush in which all our double taxation treaties are up for renegotiation, and that we are therefore under pressure to do that. That is not the case. He will be aware that the treaties and conventions have been negotiated over a period of some time, and have become due for renegotiation at different times. That is required by the changes that are made in all countries' tax systems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman centred particularly on the United States treaty. I am not about to discuss any negotiations about that because they have not yet started. I remind the hon. Gentleman that the treaty entered into force in 1980, having been in effect since 1975. A number of changes have occurred, and it is not unreasonable that some discussion of that treaty is now taking place. However, the idea that a huge loophole exists, that slapstick negotiations are going on and that a disaster is heading towards us, is not true. I am sure that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton will return to that point as, over the next 12 months, we continue to discuss our double taxation treaties and conclude our negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have considered double taxation treaties both in opposition and in government, and I know that negotiations and treaties happen gradually. That was true under the previous Government and will remain so under this Government. There is nothing wrong with the timetable: matters are proceeding as they have always done. The hon. Gentleman does not need to fear that our excellent officials who negotiate the treaties are under pressure and cannot obtain agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to changes that affect tax credits, and to the abolition of advance corporation tax. The way in which the new treaty should reflect the changes to our domestic rules on taxation of other countries will be discussed during the negotiations. Tax credits are frequently discussed in treaty talks. I remind the hon. Gentleman that the previous Government decided to try to phase out tax credits in the treaty. When the Conservative party was in government, it negotiated the changes to the two main treaties—those with Denmark and Finland. Therefore, a general view existed. The treaty that we are considering contains nothing new. It is wrong to try to portray it as a disaster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
The hon. Gentleman asked why the treaty mentions "Ireland", not "Republic of Ireland", as defined in the convention. I refer him to the Inland Revenue press release of 9 November and remind him that the practice of referring to "Ireland" is in line with the Belfast agreement. The term "Ireland" is used in the protocol, and has the same meaning as "Republic of Ireland" in the convention. The treaty thus reflects changing circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked several questions about articles and the way in which they related to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development provisions. I shall go through the articles in numerical order, which was not quite the order in which the hon. Gentleman made his points, but is easier for me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article I deals with permanent establishment. Under OECD provisions, a building site, construction or installation project constitutes a permanent establishment only if it lasts longer than 12 months. As the hon. Gentleman said, and as I pointed out in my opening remarks, the protocol provides for a building site, construction or installation project to be a permanent establishment if it lasts longer than six months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Currently, there is no time limit on arrangements between Ireland and the United Kingdom. Both countries agreed that six months was a reasonable starting point. From a United Kingdom point of view, that is a considerable improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon asked about gains and losses. He knows that we cannot put a figure on how much we gain or lose—I hope that we do not lose—in the negotiations. We are trying to ensure that we facilitate trade, and we are obviously in a strong negotiating position—the hon. Gentleman referred to the fact that Ireland is our fifth largest trading partner. It is important that treaties facilitate that position; this treaty does, and is acceptable and agreeable from our point of view. The hon. Gentleman will forgive me for saying that I cannot answer such questions—that is not because I am being difficult, that is because of the nature of the negotiations, and is always the case with double taxation treaties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton then asked about article II and dividends. A direct investor is defined by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development as a company that holds 25 per cent, of another company's capital; the protocol defines the proportion as 10 per cent. Our view is that it is more realistic to make a distinction between direct and portfolio investment by reference to voting powers than by reference to share ownership, because that more accurately reflects investments. That is why there is a slight divergence, which the hon. Gentleman pointed out. The OECD model gives us an acceptable pattern, but there are variations on it. Of course, it is right that we justify such variations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman than asked about article III and interest. There are no equivalent provisions to those of the OECD. The article is an anti-abuse measure designed to prevent artificial arrangements which exist mainly to obtain the benefits of the convention. He then asked about article V and Government services. He asked why article 18(3) refers only to educational institutions. The reason is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0362">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
that it is important to deal with the specific circumstances of teachers. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that other groups are affected by the problem, but it is much less widespread among those other groups, and the negotiations concluded on that basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Financial Secretary give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, I shall give way to him before I finish, but not now. If I respond to the substantive points first, that will make it much easier to deal with what are complicated issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton then asked what he said would be his final question, although he went on to ask two more. He asked why income from estates of deceased persons has been excluded from the taxation of income not expressly mentioned. Both the United Kingdom and Ireland have reserved rights in respect of the article with the OECD to tax income paid to our respective residents from the estates of deceased persons in the course of administration. The reason for that is that payments would lose the original identity of income on entering the estate and in effect become a new source of income. Without the special wording, the sole taxing rights would rest with our treaty partners, which would lead to double taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman then asked about the capital gains article. The text is not in the OECD model, but the OECD commentary recognises that countries may want to include such a provision. The UK seeks to include that text in double taxation conventions because it ensures, for example, that taxing rights remain in the country where immovable property is situated, even if the gain relates to shares in companies whose assets consist mainly of land. Without that reference, it would be easy to avoid the charge of UK capital gains tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Financial Secretary give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Forgive me, but if I can deal with one set of questions first, I shall be happy to take more; let us deal with what is already on the table, if the hon. Gentleman does not mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the progress made on the review of double taxation relief, discussions and informal consultations with business and representative bodies were initiated in Inland Revenue press releases on 17 March and 4 August, and they continue. As the purpose of our double taxation treaties is facilitation, it is important that we undertake thorough consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton also asked whether the reviews will be tax neutral. We are consulting on the measures and we need to see the results of that consultation before we make our decisions and present them to the House of Commons. We must first ensure that we conduct the consultations constructively and positively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I promised to give way to the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon when I had concluded the first series of answers; if it will keep him in order, I shall take that as an intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to the Financial Secretary, who is as generous as she was during the Finance Bill and will, no doubt, have opportunities next year to continue this pattern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer the Financial Secretary to article 18, with which she has been dealing. Does she acknowledge that unilateral relief would not be satisfactory for people other than teachers, who are covered by article 18?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We believe that the treaty negotiations present the best terms for people who were affected by the problems created specifically by the two contradictory announcements. When discussing the treaty, I was asked why it dealt with the issues before us today. The answer is the same as that to the question asked by the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon. The United Kingdom and Ireland agreed that they wanted to tackle the pressing points as quickly as possible so as to deal with the emerging problems and changes in legislation in both countries. That is why the treaty needed to be dealt with and why it needs to be agreed in this country and in Ireland by the end of year. Both countries agree that we need the treaty by the end of the year, and that is why it is before the Committee today. I hope that the Committee will now endorse it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.8 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for some of the full and clear responses to my questions, but the Financial Secretary has left several gaps, so perhaps we could try again. My first question was whether a tax loophole caused by the Government's decision to halve tax credits will exist next year unless the treaty is in place by the end of this year. Is that so?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, why does the treaty not contain an independent personal services article? The Financial Secretary says that the forthcoming renegotiation of the United States treaty is part of routine negotiations, and that there is nothing to worry about, but if it is so routine, why was it not included in the April 1998 list of treaties to be renegotiated?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary talks about the long-term aspiration of removing from all treaties dividend tax credit repayments. I accept that that process was started in the last years of the previous Conservative Government, but that was a long-term aspiration; it was not an urgent requirement, as it has now become because of the Government's decision last July.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary agrees that education is not the only area of state activity that may give rise to future uncertainty. Why, therefore, did the Government not make the effort of dealing with the other areas rather than winding up the negotiations early? I sought confirmation of whether it was because of the time shortage caused by the fact that a loophole for next year loomed as a result of the Government's decisions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, will the Financial Secretary answer my question about capital gains, rather than answering her own question? Will she explain the difference between the "gains" in article IV and "capital gains", which appeared in the old treaty. Where does UK tax legislation refer to "gains"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0363">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Financial Secretary that I am keen to learn about the information-gathering powers in the double taxation treaty. Is the Inland Revenue's policy to use those powers on a case-by-case basis where there is prima facie evidence of fraud of evasion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.10 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem is not that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton does not like my answer but that he does not understand it. I responded to his allegation that a tax loophole is the result of our haste to agree the treaty by the end of the year. I repeat that Ireland and the United Kingdom agreed on the need to change the tax treaty before the end of the year and on the importance of tackling other pressing points, especially pension rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton wanted to know why certain matters were not included. I shall repeat my answer in a different way. The purpose of the protocol is to amend those matters that are in the most urgent need of change. Officials from the United Kingdom and Ireland have conceded that a number of matters were in need of amendment, but decided that the most important ones demanded immediate attention. There is nothing unusual about such decisions in negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
The hon. Gentleman raised a problem that might arise in connection with article 18(3) of the convention. I made the mistake of saying that such a problem might occur. Let me rephrase my answer: I know of no groups other than teachers which have had problems as a result of different interpretations of the treaty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I am sorry that I forgot to answer the question that the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon asked about information-gathering powers. I am not in a position to give him an answer today, so I will write to him and other members of the Committee. In a previous life the hon. Gentleman was a solicitor, so he knows that information is exchanged under treaties in a number of ways—including on a case-by-case basis if, for instance, one Administration identified information that would interest another. If I check the record, however, I think that I will find that the hon. Gentleman was asking more directly whether it was done only on a case-by-case basis. If it is acceptable to you, Mr. Jones, as well as to the hon. Gentleman, I shall give the answer in writing to all members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
