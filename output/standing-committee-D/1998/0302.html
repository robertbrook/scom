	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be for the convenience of the Committee to know that the chair is entirely content if hon. Members wish to remove their jackets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security (Mr. Stephen Timms)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That, during proceedings on the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock, except on Tuesday 9th March when the Committee will meet at half-past Ten o'clock only, and on Thursdays at Ten o'clock and at half-past Two o'clock.</p></blockquote>
I begin by welcoming all members of the Committee. May I say how pleased we all are to be working under our two Chairmen—you, Mr. Malins, and Mr. McWilliam. I know that you will both guide us ably through this substantial Bill, both of you were with some of us during our deliberations on the Contributions Agency Transfer Bill the week before last. Few of us will wish to repeat the hours that we clocked up on that occasion, but in other respects it augured well for our work under your chairmanship and that of Mr. McWilliam.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also welcome to the Committee the hon. Members for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies) and for Newbury (Mr. Rendel), who will lead for the Opposition parties. Government Members look forward to the vigour with which they will no doubt press their arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also welcome my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security, He will address much of the Bill at different stages of our deliberations, in particular the parts dealing with changes to disability benefits. I also take this opportunity to welcome my right hon. Friend the Minister for Employment, Welfare to Work and Equal Opportunities. He and I have worked closely together in the past and I look forward to our doing so again on this Committee. He will guide the Committee through the part of the Bill dealing with our central reforms on the single work-focused gateway to the benefit system, employment zones and other measures relating to job seekers' allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other hon. Members bring to the Committee a wide variety of experience. The hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) and my hon. Friends the Members for Doncaster, North (Mr. Hughes), for Colne Valley (Kali Mountford) and for Gravesham (Mr. Pond) clearly enjoyed their experience on the previous Session's Social Security Bill and have come back for more. I am also pleased to see that the hon. Members for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait), for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) and for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) and my hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mrs. McKenna)
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
are on the Committee. I enjoyed their contributions on second Reading, although there was not much that I could agree with in what Opposition members said, except where the hon. members for Canterbury, for Gainsborough and for Grantham and Stamford revealed that they had not agreed with large chunks of the previous Government's programme. Perhaps we shall return to that matter during our deliberations. Other members of the Committee bring experience from the Social Security Select Committee, previous social security and education bills and elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be helpful if I briefly outline the measures in the Bill so that the Committee can judge whether the sittings motion allows for their appropriate scrutiny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill introduces radical modernisation of the benefits and pensions system. The world has changed dramatically since Beveridge designed our welfare system 50 years ago. Then, women worked mainly at home and Beveridge assumed that the would stay there. Today, two out of three women of working age work outside the home. Fifty years ago, the average life expectancy for men in retirement was about a year. Today, things have changed enormously for the better. Disabled people's expectations have changed dramatically: they are not willing to be consigned to the margins. Beveridge simply assumed that disabled people would not work. Today, disabled people rightly want to play a full part in our society and to fulfil their ambitions alongside everyone else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill has four key areas: a package of welfare-to-work measures, modernisation of disability benefits, modernisation of bereavement benefits and reform of the pension system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first area that we shall consider is pension reform. The Bill will establish the statutory basis for stakeholder pension schemes. By providing the framework for our new low-cost pension schemes, the Bill will give up to 5 million people who are without a second funded pension the chance to save for their retirement with the benefits of one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second major aspect of pension reform is delivery of our commitment to enable pension sharing. Pension rights will be treated like other assets, providing greater flexibility for those going through divorce and for the courts. There has been extensive consultation on those measures. The draft legislation was scrutinised in detail by the Social Security Select Committee, which produced a valuable report. The Select Committee included some hon. Members who are members of this Standing Committee—the hon. Members for Arundel and South Downs and for Gainsborough and my hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham. The Bill also makes improvements to the regulatory regime for occupational and personal pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second key area is reform of bereavement benefits. The Bill will extend the bereavement benefit to men for the first time. The lump sum payable to provide more help with immediate costs, such as funeral expenses, will be doubled and, again for the first time, will be payable to widowers as well as widows. Bereavement benefit will be time limited where there are no children involved, but the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0473">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Bill provides for transitional non-means-tested help for widows and widowers without children for the six months following bereavement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third key area is a package of welfare-to-work measures. The Bill will introduce the new single gateway for people of working age. That will ensure that, for the first time, people of working age can have the help and support that they need to get into or return to work, bringing the Employment Service, the Benefits Agency and local authorities together in a way that suits the individual rather than the bureaucracy. That will be a fundamental change for the better in the way in which our welfare system works and it will have far-reaching implications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second welfare-to-work measure in the Bill is the introduction of a requirement for joint claims to jobseeker's allowance from young couples without children. That will ensure that both members of a couple have access to the support and advice that they need from the Employment Service and, if they have been unemployed for more than six months, access to the new deal for young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill also provides for the new programme of employment zones to focus resources on areas that suffer from persistently high unemployment, building on the prototype zones which are already operating. The new personal job account will help unemployed people aged 25 or over to improve their skills, obtain extra help in finding work and even obtain help to set up in business for themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will reform and modernise support for disabled people and includes provisions to introduce a personal capability assessment. The reforms will end the assumption that people on incapacity benefit cannot be helped, in the right circumstances, to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will restore incapacity benefit to its original intention of helping people who lose their income when illness or disability forces them to give up work. In future, it will be paid to those who have worked and made the right level of contributions in one of the previous two tax years. In addition, further provisions in the Bill introduce a fairer partnership between the state and employers by changing the way in which occupational or personal pensions are treated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill contains other changes in disability and sickness benefits, which were welcomed by hon. Members on both sides of the House on Second Reading. It will extend the higher rate mobility payment in disability living allowance to severely disabled children aged three and four. In future, people who are disabled in youth will be entitled to incapacity benefit without having to meet the usual contribution conditions. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security announced on Second Reading that the age limit for entry for that benefit will be increased to 25 for disabled young people in higher education. We propose to introduce an amendment in Committee to achieve that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is wide-ranging and important. It begins the vital task of transforming and modernising our welfare system. We shall no longer abandon people merely to receiving benefits, when their position could be transformed by active help and advice. We have a major
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
task ahead of us as we scrutinise the Bill clause by clause and I am confident that we shall be able to carry out our task in a good-natured and friendly Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Grantham and Stamford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I endorse what the Minister of State said, Mr. Malins, about the pleasure that we all feel in seeing you presiding over the Committee? We had a dress rehearsal for this Committee the other day, in another Committee, which had many of the same faces on both sides and, indeed, behind the Table. We observed the elegant and civilised manner in which you presided over that other sitting. Although it went on to a late hour, tempers never frayed and we owe much to you, Mr. Malins, for the fact that we were able to get through the business effectively and in a congenial fashion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like to pay tribute in advance to my colleagues who will support me during our deliberations. My hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles), will support me as the other Opposition Front-Bench spokesman. He and I will share the burden—a considerable one, as we have seen—of ensuring that the Bill is thoroughly scrutinised and debated as it goes through Parliament and, where we can muster the voting strength to do so, of improving it. It is certainly badly in need of improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also a great pleasure to see in Committee several colleagues with considerable experience and background knowledge to bring to our deliberations. They all have a distinguished record; we have not merely put anyone who was around on to the Committee; we have not press-ganged people. Hon. Members have come forward because they are keen to play a major part in the consideration of this important Bill. I trust that they will do so, when we hear from them. My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough has experience both in government and on the Back Benches, and has for many years played a major part on the Select Committee on Social Security.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs has considerable professional experience in pensions and I hope that we shall hear from him on that subject and on others. He will bring a distinguished record to our debate. My hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury has, as the Minister mentioned, taken a great interest in family issues, in the House, as has my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham, who will act as my Whip. With her looking at me with her usual eagle eye, and you looking at me with your's Mr. Malins, I shall have little chance of going astray.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like to say what a pleasure it is to be debating with the Minister. He and I have known each other since he came into the House and in the previous Parliament we served as Back Benches on the Select Committee on Treasury, in which there were many occasions when we were able to agree constructively. May I congratulate him on his party's elevation to government and on his rapid promotion within it? It is a pleasure to be opposite him again, although I doubt that we shall always see eye to eye on the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister for Employment, Welfare to Work and Equal Opportunities is also an old friend; I believe that he and I are exact contemporaries in the House. I recall that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0474">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
when we started here in 1987, we served together once or twice as Back Benchers on Standing Committees whose sittings were very long, so we have a great deal of experience there. He subsequently joined the then Opposition Treasury Front Bench, and we had some memorable times on opposite sides of Finance Bill Committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like to welcome the Under-Secretary of State for Social Security, who has mastered his complicated brief very well in the time that he has been here, although he draws some peculiar conclusions from the facts that he has amassed and the briefs that he has digested. However, we can always hope that good argument will persuade sound and open minds and I do not doubt that Labour Members' minds are sound and open. We start our consideration of the Bill with optimism, despite the fact that the prevailing circumstances are not favourable or encouraging.

On Second Reading, I said that one of the over-arching facts about the Bill is that it is a peculiar piece of legislation. It is really three Bills in one. Proper parliamentary consideration should be given to its provisions on stakeholder pensions and pension splitting on divorce and to its welfare measures, although the Bill should be called the welfare destruction Bill rather than the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill. Our Second Reading debate was curtailed to just over four hours—it was deliberately held on the same day that there was a euro statement and a business statement. We spent less than one and a half hours considering each of the Bill's important themes. Frankly, that is pretty insulting to Parliament and it is not a good augury. I hope that the Government will not be tempted to try to steamroller the Committee in the way that they tried to steamroller Parliament on Second Reading. It is unfortunate to begin our sittings without having had the normal debate and scrutiny that a Bill's principles normally receive on Second Reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there is an even more disturbing development. I have not tabled an amendment proposing that we defer consideration of the provisions relating to stakeholder pensions until after 31 March because, for technical reasons, that would not be an acceptable amendment to a Bill. The Government have given the public assurances that are not in the Bill and we cannot therefore discuss them. That is a glaring inadequacy of the present situation and a clear example of Parliament and of the public—who sent us here—being treated with much less than the respect that they deserve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government published their—or perhaps I should say the Department of Social Security published its—Green Paper on stakeholder pensions in December, and about six weeks later the Treasury produced different proposals on stakeholder pensions, involving the so-called lifelong individual savings account. Those documents stated that the consultation period would last until 31 March and comments were invited by that date. I am not making a rhetorical point. Many organisations have been working to try to meet that deadline. They believed that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
Government's word could be taken at face value, the Government's invitation to the public to respond was genuine and given in good faith, and that there would be a proper consultation exercise. However, those organisations found that they had been cheated—the Government had no such intentions. The Bill appeared on 15 February and it was steamrollered through on Second Reading in the manner that I described earlier. We are still a month away from the deadline of 31 March, but we are beginning the Bill's Committee stage. People may submit their comments by 31 March, but they have no chance of influencing the Bill's shape.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The public and Parliament have been made a fool of. Many worthy and important organisations in our national life, including industrial organisations, the pensions industry, actuaries, voluntary organisations, charitable groups, especially those that focus on the needs of the disabled and widows, and groups concerned with marriage and family life, including lawyers and the churches, have been ripped off. They have the same experience that one has when one makes a fool of oneself doing a deal with a secondhand car salesman, who is cleverer or more ruthless than one had anticipated, and who gets away with it. The Government's reprehensible behaviour has left just such a taste in the mouths of the entire country. If they intended to produce a Bill on 15 February, they should have said so when the Green Paper was introduced. If the Green Paper states that the consultation period will end on 31 March, the Government should respect that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do the Government intend to continue in that vein by publishing meaningless dates for the conclusion of consultation periods? Will their efforts to make fools of the public become a general habit? Such behaviour would seriously undermine the cause of good, honest government and the respect with which British people regard institutions such as the legislature and executive. It would also result in legislation that is even more unworkable and contradictory than that which the Government have hitherto produced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a serious matter. The Government are using their majority to spew out legislation that has not been properly considered. If those on whom such legislation may impact are denied the opportunity to bring potential flaws to the Government's attention before Bills are drafted and Committee proceedings have begun, the inevitable result will be worse laws. Courts will be clogged up with unnecessary litigation and people will feel disappointment and injustice. Legislation will reduce, rather than enhance, justice and the sum of human happiness in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to say that the Minister, who probably feels ashamed at the Government's behaviour, did not have the decency to apologise to the public. I hope that he takes the opportunity to do so by catching your eye, Mr. Malins, before we finish debating the sittings motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The convention is that one should not recognise members of the public who attend Standing Committee proceedings. However, one or two representatives of organisations are present who did not comment on the Bill because they were cheated into believing that they had until 31 March to do so. I asked representatives of the National Association of Pension Funds for their views on the Bill. Their letter, which I have in front of me, states
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0475">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
that they had yet to respond because they believed that the deadline was 31 March. Many other organisations are in the same position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an extremely bad day's work by the Government, for which, I dare say, the Minister of State's boss, the Secretary of State, may be responsible. It is even more likely that those who drive the Government from No. 10 Downing street, such as Alastair Campbell, and who treat the public with contempt and mock the principle of consultation, are responsible. The Government should think again, because the Opposition will not accept lightly such behaviour, which will generate a wave of indignation in the country as a whole. This is a sophisticated democracy and the Government have set an appalling example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to aspects of the Bill relating to the time allowed by the sittings motion for debate, the order in which matters will be considered, and the appropriateness to the Bill's substance of the logic set out in the motion. The Bill's first few clauses deal with the stakeholder issue. Easy access for everyone to pension provision is, at first sight, naturally attractive to all reasonably minded men and women, and to Opposition Members. The desirability of more savings and long-term savings, and of people having better provision for their old age and retirement, should be the substance of political consensus. We would be only too delighted to facilitate such developments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether the Government mean their rhetoric—I do not like to accuse people of being two-faced or using double-speak. If contradictions exist between the rhetoric and the deeds of the Government, I prefer to think that the lesser of two evils is the explanation and that it is the result of a lack of homework, consideration, proper planning, and—I repeat—a lack of consultation. If the Government are not prepared to listen to anyone else and if their majority has made them so arrogant that they do not recognise such a need, they will make bad mistakes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill contains evident contradictions—rather than mere weaknesses—not least in relation to stakeholder pensions. First, it is, sadly, far from true that everyone would be advantaged by greater pension provision and greater savings. Not only is it a lie, but it would be irresponsible and cruel to promote the idea that everyone would necessarily gain by saving more for their retirement. I explained on the Floor of the House why that is the case. At current annuity rates, it is necessary to accumulate at least £80,000—or possibly £100,000—to generate an income in retirement that will correspond to means-tested benefits that would be forgone such as income support, housing benefit and council tax relief. Consequently, those who saved more—£150,000 to £200,000—would gain some positive return, but it would be small. Setting aside such an amount might not be worth the sacrifice of current consumption or the investment risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Saving such an amount from a modest salary requires an inordinate—I use the term advisedly—sacrifice. Someone on average earnings of £18,000 a year would have to save £1,000 a year throughout 40 years of working life—he or she might save more in some years and less in others, but would have to maintain the level of saving. An accumulation of £40,000, which at a 3 per cent. real
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
investment return would yield £75,000 to £80,000, would put the saver at the break-even point, which makes it pointless to save.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman should realise that this is a sittings motion. To an extent, he is moving the Committee into a series of clause stand part debates, for which there will be ample opportunity in due course. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will restrict himself to the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As always, Mr. Malins, I shall be guided by you. I appreciate that I must not anticipate clause stand part debates, but I was dealing with a principle that underlies the stakeholder pension, which cannot be covered under any individual clause. When considering the stakeholder, we should recognise that any sort of pension provision may be inappropriate and, indeed, a mis-selling for large numbers of our fellow citizens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another worrying aspect of the stakeholder clauses is that they are influenced throughout by an extraordinarily old-fashioned and inept perception of the current labour market. The Department of Social Security—not the Treasury, as the rival lifelong individual savings account proposals do not reflect such a view—is clearly obsessed with the idea that any pension vehicle must be set up in the form of a trust. We have nothing against trusts: they often work extremely well. However, the trust idea is fundamentally based on the concept that employees can come together in sufficient numbers to make setting up a trust worthwhile and that employees and pensioners will stay together in an identifiable group for the rest of their working lives. In some big companies, in both the public and private sectors, that remains true, and I am delighted that it does. Where people work for smaller employers, they may be able to come together on a trade, trade union or friendly society basis in a trust vehicle. Only in that context, where trustees nominate pensioners or workers, do trusts make sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a world in which people tend to move jobs and change employers, and in which technology changes the fundamental structure of industry every decade or so, the obsession with trusts is inappropriate. In considering the Bill, we must bear in mind that the Government's view of the world needs serious updating and revision. One understands why, without consultation, the Government fall into such traps.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The stakeholder proposals—a serious matter that bears directly on the issue of how much consideration we should give the Bill—present the most appalling confusion in the Government's mind. The Bill does not even mention lifelong individual savings accounts or the Treasury's rival proposals for the kind of pension vehicle that should be made available in future. As I have said elsewhere, in many cases leases are probably more appropriate in principle than stakeholder pensions for those pensioners who should, in their own rational interests, make greater pension provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is a complete and utter mess, our amendments, some of which I see, Mr. Malins, you have accepted—we are grateful for that and we shall need some time to debate
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0476">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
them—try to redress the damage done by the fragmentation of the whole pension area as a result of this Government's decisions and ill thought-through and ill co-ordinated initiatives. We have occupational pensions, personal pensions, the stakeholder pension concept and the LISA concept. It is not clear to anybody how they will relate to each other. The Bill is full of things like "The stakeholder pension must be a trust, but, on the other hand, it does not have to be, because regulations might be introduced which waive that". The Government are clearly in a complete mess about how they will resolve those issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issues must be clarified during our debates and I hope that, whether the Bill proceeds or not, at least the general public know at the end of our proceedings, because of assurances that are made in Committee or changes that we make to the Bill, exactly what the pensions regime is, what qualifies as a stakeholder pension and what options are available, so that people can take advice and decided whether they should be taking out a pension and, if so, what kind of pension. That is fundamental.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fourth aspect that the Government have not considered and is not in the Bill—again we have tabled some amendments that we hope will redress that evident lack—is the difficulties for employers. The Government continually pile new obligations on employers. You will not want me to go into the details of that now, Mr. Malins, but they are doing so, and they are doing it again in the Bill. They think that it is simple to say, "Employers can lay all this on. Employers can do this, that and the other." They do not realise that an appallingly bad day's work would be done if, as a result of further burdens on employers, employers become less likely to employ people or, if self-employed people became reluctant to take on their first or second employee at a crucial stage. To deprive a person of a job because of a notional pension benefit would be deeply ironic and foolish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must consider carefully the economic impact of the Government's proposals and the direct impact on employers—and therefore on their propensity to employ—and on employment levels. The Government appear to have given that no consideration. That is not surprising, because they will not consult with people and they make it clear that they are not interested in listening to people. It is inevitable that they will make serious errors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some hon. Members may think that I am speaking for a long time on a sittings motion, but we are really discussing three Bills and there should be three Standing Committees and three sittings motions. I have no influence with Mr. Alastair Campbell and it is not my fault that the Government have taken this route. I deprecate and deplore it, and I hope that our view is becoming clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are serious errors in the way in which pension sharing has been developed and promoted in Parliament. However, as a fair-minded man I shall give credit where it is due and criticism where that is due. The Government set a good example when they asked the Social Security Select Committee to examine the proposals. I hope that
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
they will follow that procedure in future, but they have undermined some of the benefits with other pieces of foolishness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is in danger of re-running the Second Reading debate.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Malins. I shall return to the matter in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that it is in order to raise another aspect of the Government's proposals of which I do not approve. The Bill is important and has been presented as part of a feminist agenda. I refer to the previous Secretary of State's foreword to the consultation document—it was called a consultation document, but we know what the Government mean by consultation—last summer, which stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We believe pension provision should be fair for women …"—</p></blockquote>
we all agree with that and we might add that it should be fair to men also—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the main beneficiaries will be women."</p></blockquote>
You will not want me to read great extracts of the document now, Mr. Malins, but anyone who wants to read it should do so. They will see that pension sharing is being presented as part of a feminist agenda. New Labour and political correctness mean doing something for women.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is amusing the Committee, but he is out of order and must remain within the sittings motion. He knows that I said that earlier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The sitting motion is, by definition, fairly narrow. There will be many opportunities in due course to raise such matters on clause stand part debate. We must remain within the sittings motion.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying hard, Mr. Malins, not to say anything which should more properly be said in a clause stand part debate or elsewhere in our proceedings. This is our opportunity to decide how the Bill should be considered, in what order and in what time. It is important to describe to the Committee how the Government have presented the Bill There is a fundamental divide between the Opposition and the Government. We believe that Parliament's task is to enhance justice. We should legislate for human beings: for men and women. Our agenda should not be to legislate for one category of humanity because that happens to be politically correct or fashionable. We all know of cases among constituents or our friends of women who have been treated unjustly under the present system and who might have received
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0477">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
better justice under our divorce laws, had an opportunity for pension sharing existed. A wife who is deserted after a long marriage and left without resources, when her husband has a substantial asset in the form of a pension, might have been able to share that pension. That goes to the heart of the Bill. Equally, the opposite may arise. A friend of mine, who is a highly paid director of a City merchant bank, has a husband who, by any standards, would be described as a ne'er-do-well: he frequently gets drunk, he has beaten her up on one or two occasions, he is having an affair with someone else at present, he has no income of his own and he lives off her. If he divorced her once the Bill came into effect, he would walk away with a substantial share of her pension, for which she has worked and he had done absolutely nothing. Therefore, injustice can be on both sides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our considerations should not be influenced by a person's sex, age or religion, by the colour of their hair or skin or by any other extraneous factors. We should do justice for individuals. The one distinction that we might make and Parliament properly has always made—as I believe that the laws of the land in any civilised nation do—should be between adults, who to some extent can look after themselves, and children, because any legislature has a responsibility to protect those who cannot protect themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is extraordinary about the Bill—this goes to the heart of the issue about how we should debate it, how much time we need on it and what amendments are required—is that it says nothing at all about children. I looked at the Bill and all the supporting documentation. The Labour Government are not interested in children: they do not mention them. We will put that to rights, if one or two of our amendments are accepted. It is a key issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another extraordinary thing about the Bill is that the Government are utterly unco-ordinated. They think that there is rivalry between different Departments, each doing its own thing. The Lord Chancellor is on record as saying that he is carrying out a review of ancillary relief. We do not know the result of that review or what legislative proposals the Lord Chancellor will make to the House. Unless the Government decide to abolish Parliament and rule by decree, presumably the Lord Chancellor will eventually make some legislative proposals to the House, if he wants to change the rules on ancillary relief. We do not know whether he does want to or in what direction. Clearly that will cut completely across the issue before us now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After all, the varying of pension-sharing orders and other pension-splitting arrangements, including earmarking, which is modified in the Bill, go to the heart of ancillary relief. It is extraordinary that the Government are introducing the Bill while another Department, we are told, is considering the matter, and clearly doing so more in the round than the Department of Social Security, and we do not know the results of those deliberations. That might lead to our wasting our time completely in the Committee, because the provisions will all be overtaken and have to be revised when the Lord Chancellor makes up his mind and makes other proposals. Alternatively, we will have contradictory legislation. Either of those
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
developments would be extremely undesirable and Parliament would be doing a bad day's work if that were allowed to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then the Lord Chancellor said that he is considering whether pre-nuptial agreements should be enforceable in a court of law. I accept right now that, if he decides that there should be clear pre-nuptial agreements, some of the amendments that I shall table to improve protections for individuals will not be necessary. We can save time now if we know that the Government will opt for recognition of pre-nuptial agreements. However, if we only know that they are considering that option and that the Lord Chancellor has said that he is favourably minded to it, again we are completely wasting our time. This goes to the heart of the matter, the sittings motion and the time of this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I much appreciate the intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must provide in the sittings motion, however, for consideration of an aspect of the Government's pension-sharing proposal, which I do not think is even their idea. By not consulting or thinking issues through properly, they will pay the price and learn the lesson the hard way. However, they still have time to accept Opposition amendments and to reconsider matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members are anxious to avoid enacting an ill-thought-through pension-splitting—or pension-sharing, as the Government prefer to call it—measure, which will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0478">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
induce a distortion of people's behaviour or produce perverse behavioural consequences. That is a technical term meaning people behaving in self-destructive and unfortunate ways, which are not in their interests or those of society. A clear example would be the extent to which people might be deterred from marrying because they have a considerable pension and they know that if there is even a small chance of the marriage breaking up they will lose a large part of it. For those who live together without getting married, no such consequences would follow. No Committee member should have any illusions that the Bill in its present form could directly contribute to people who might otherwise marry deciding not to do so. That has consequences for families, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury tried to draw the Committee's attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, the enactment of ill-thought-through legislation might lead to people who otherwise might not divorce having an inducement to do so. There may be tax reasons for doing so, if one party to a marriage has a substantial pension entitlement giving him or her a level of pension income that would incur taxation at 40 per cent—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may say so, Mr. Malins, this important matter is not provided for in the sittings motion, which is a great mistake. It is essential that the behavioural consequences of any Bill, and whether they are benign or malevolent for society, are considered. Committee members may have different values and different objectives, but that should become clear as a result of our debates. Another inducement to divorce might occur if one party who had a substantial annuity income had a fatal illness. In those circumstance, it might be sensible to divorce so that a large part of the value of the pension could be handed over to the surviving spouse.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, I accept that, Mr. Malins. I am also grateful for your assurance—which I assume is a bankable assurance to which I may subsequently refer—that there will be opportunities to discuss the important matters on which I touched, but which, under your guidance, I shall now leave. However, I shall not leave them definitively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
The Minister of State spoke at length about welfare reform, as he calls it, or welfare destruction, as I call it. You would think it unnatural of me. Mr. Malins, as an Opposition spokesman, not to touch on the Bill's so-called merits, which the Minister of State proclaimed so explicitly. My comments on the matter will take up no more of the Committee's time than the Minister of State's.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Conservative party is in favour of genuine welfare reform. The welfare system is extremely expensive and does not always procure the results that it should. It does not always contribute to the maximising of job opportunities, to the pursuit of socially responsible behaviour on the part of individuals, or to behaviour that is in individuals' own interests. Some aspects of the system are wasteful, perverse, corrupting and incite dependency. That is damaging.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difference between the Conservative party and the Labour party is that the latter appears to think that we should get rid of the social insurance aspects of the welfare system and steadily means-test universal contributory benefits. Where the Government think that means-testing is part of the solution, we think that it is part of the problem. That fundamental divide will inform consideration of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are doing one or two things with which we are perfectly happy, and which we would have done ourselves. Indeed, in one respect, they are continuing our policies. A Conservative Government introduced the jobseeker's allowance, the purpose of which was to ensure a greater connection between the activities of unemployed people—looking for work, taking appropriate courses and acting on advice given—and the benefit that they receive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are happy with the extension of that principle to single mothers, provided that they are not forced to work rather than stay at home and look after their children. Single mothers were rightly worried about the Government's initial proposals and I am glad to say that we have already secured that concession from the Government on the Floor of the House. I am sure that you will agree, Mr. Malins, that our being at one with the Government on the matter is directly relevant to the sittings motion. Our consensus should help the Committee's proceedings, because less time may be needed for debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour Members may not be convinced by our arguments. They may like means-testing and want to destroy the national insurance system; if so, I hope that we can convert them to our point of view. However, they cannot deny that our arguments are consistent with the way in which we believe that other parts of their proposals ought to be treated. We are bitterly opposed to the means-testing and destruction of existing contributory benefits. People have planned their lives on the basis that they will receive those benefits as long as they have maintaine their national insurance contribution record. That applies both to widow's benefit, which will be obliterated and replaced by means-tested bereavement benefit, and to incapacity benefit. Therefore, we disagree strongly with the Government and we shall need time to go into those matters in detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a connection between two aspects of the provisions—the Government's approach to disability and incapacity and the disciplines associated with the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0479">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
jobseeker's allowance, which includes a requirement for interviews—which the Government have not thought through properly. We should distinguish between those two issues, which are combined in the Bill's provisions and in the sittings motion. It is reasonable that there should be some kind of all-work test—there has to be a test to determine whether people qualify for incapacity benefit or other disability benefits. We are also in favour of people who receive benefits getting help and advice about returning to work. However, those two interviews should be separated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not want people to attend interviews with someone who calls himself a counsellor—the counsellor's job is to try to help them, whether they are disabled, single mothers, or able-bodied people without family commitments who would therefore have an obligation to go back to work. In all cases, we want people to regard the interview with the counsellor as something positive, where they can talk frankly about their interests, background, hopes, aspirations and difficulties. We do not want that to be combined with an interview designed to trick people into admitting to some capacity that they would not otherwise have—or would not have on most days, but might have on a good day—and thereby lose their entitlement to benefit. We want to separate those two interviews and that point is not dealt with in the Bill. The sittings motion should therefore be modified, so that we can consider it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You will be relieved to hear, Mr. Malins, that from now on I do not propose to make further comments on the substance of the Bill, or on the considerable divide that exists between the Government and the Opposition on the Bill's fundamental principles. I shall, however, make a general point. The Opposition are committed to looking seriously and constructively at all the issues. We are not in the business of wasting time. Everything that I have said so far, and everything that I and my colleagues will say in the Committee, will be said because it needs to be said and for no other reason. The Government must take the proceedings seriously, and not succumb to the temptation, which they find difficult to resist, of saying, "We have an enormous majority and a wonderful media-manipulating machine outside the House, so we can get away with absolutely anything." They must take seriously their responsibility to explain the proposals in the Bill, listen open-mindedly to the arguments on them, and ensure that all those matters are considered in the round, from all the angles that they should be, even though in many cases they have not been subject to the proper consultation period before the Bill was introduced. If they will take that responsibility seriously, we shall respond in the same spirit. To use an old English phrase, if the Government will play cricket, then we shall play cricket. This is an important Bill and it would be damaging for society and for some fundamental values in our country if it were allowed to reach the statute book without considerable amendment. It will be the Committee's task to ensure that it receives the consultation that, regrettably and disgracefully, it did not receive before entering this legislative phase, and to ensure that wherever possible it is amended in the right direction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Kali Mountford 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Colne Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you, Mr. Malins, to the Chair. It is the first time that I have had an opportunity to sit on a Committee under your chairmanship. I have sat on a Committee that was chaired by Mr. McWilliam. I look forward to his taking the Chair—our previous encounters have been enjoyable. Some Opposition Members have sat on similar Committees and I know that we are in for a treat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already had a treat this morning—the speech of the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford. I must lift the veil from his eyes. He is obviously under the impression that Labour Members were press-ganged into sitting on the Committee. I assure him that I am here willingly, happily and voluntarily and that I am full of excitement about our debates in the coming weeks. I am also delighted to have an opportunity to examine the Bill in the round. I should be disappointed if Opposition Members were not interested in all aspects of the Bill—I listened carefully the hon. Gentleman's comments, and I was surprised by many of them. There seems to have been a wholehearted change of approach and style among Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From 1975 to 1996, I worked in what was then called the Department of Employment. For the first 10 of those years, I was involved in the delivery and calculation of benefits. I was a member of the civil service and I recall the Thatcher Government introducing the reforms that broke the principle of contributed benefits and which moved closer to a means-testing benefits system. I am surprised by some of the comments that we heard earlier. The general thrust of the delivery of benefits has been increasingly towards means-tested and I look forward to hearing in due course the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford explain the need for that change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kali Mountford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall continue. The hon. Gentleman made a long and gallant speech and it would be a shame not to make a little progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman discussed—in part—the Bill's main thrust, which is about equality in relation to all recipients and all benefits, and the benefits relating to pensions and divorce. The Government's bereavement benefits will have the opposite effect to that which he suggested—men who were not previously recipients of the benefit will receive it. Such equality should be welcomed by all members of the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will take us away from a system involving benefits policing, which I encountered when I was a civil servant, towards a supportive system, which will treat claimants and recipients of pensions, benefits and support entirely differently. It was difficult to work in a benefits system in which a clerk's main duties were to police the behaviour of the recipients of benefits. A move from that system is welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For some years, I was on the management committee of a welfare rights organisation. I witnessed changes in people's lives, which Opposition Members are obviously
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0480">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
trying to forget. It is particularly important to give support to people when they are incapacitated or ill. Conservative Members have forgotten the time when people who were ill were used as a way of getting numbers off the benefit register, to massage the unemployment figures. That approach did nothing for the person who was incapacitated, ill or disabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we examine the Bill in the round, we need to consider equality, equal treatment and independent living, which is another of the Bill's themes. On Second Reading, I felt that Opposition Members had missed the importance of independent living. During our consideration in Committee, we must pay attention to fairness, equal treatment and, primarily, support. If we are not cognisant of the fact that someone with a disability also has many abilities and should have an opportunity to play a full part in society, we will do him or her a great disservice. I am looking forward to our discussion of those aspects of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford referred to the all-work test. He will recall that it was his Government that introduced the all-work test. That was a bitter blow to people because it focused on what they cannot do, rather than on what they can do. I look forward to a change in attitude towards people who have apparently been left on benefits so that they will have a whole new life with hope, expectation and aspiration. That flows through the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that there was little mention of children in the Bill. He has not read those parts of the Bill covering severe disablement benefits for children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kali Mountford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot resist indulging the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My mention of children referred to the pension-sharing provisions and I stand by that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will not the hon. Lady apply to herself the consistency that she demands of others? Will she join me in saying that there was too much means-testing in the welfare system on 1 May 1997, but that, if means-testing is thought to be dangerous, it is pretty stupid greatly to extend it and to attack the elements of social insurance with contributory benefit? That is precisely what the Government have done since coming to power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kali Mountford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman seems to be trying to rewrite history. He totally misunderstands the thrust not just of the Bill, but of other Bills and the changes that we have already seen. The contributory principle lies at the heart of all the Government's proposals. On stakeholder pensions, the hon. Gentleman would find it difficult to suggest that people should not contribute to their own pensions. Let us not forget the other part of the Government's proposals for second pension schemes. That is not in the Bill, so I shall not go too far down that line. Every Bill must be considered in the context of change. The hon. Gentleman ignores some
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
of the comments that he made in the Opposition day debate on pensions. He was inconsistent in his comments on how people should make contributions to their own pensions. I wondered whether the Opposition had changed their minds about people contributing to their own pensions. He seemed to be making a case for an entirely state-provided pension scheme, which I know was not his party's proposal when in Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see no problem in extending opportunities to people to enable them to make provision for their own old age. That is what the first part of the Bill does, it is an extension of the main thrust of the Bill—independence and independent living.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my 20 years' experience of working in benefits, I have never met anyone who luxuriated in a life on benefits. It is not a happy life. People on benefit are on the breadline and we do not want people to stay there, benefits should be temporary, even when people have—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am showing patience, but the hon. Lady knows that she is straying, so perhaps she will return to the narrow subject of the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Kali Mountford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, Mr. Malins. You are absolutely right. The temptation is too great when responding to the hon. Gentleman because he set a poor example and I apologise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I look forward to our future sittings because the Bill extends the important principles of equality between the sexes, opportunity for all, fairness and fundamental support from the system for people in their hour of need, and replaces the policing of people who are in receipt of benefits. The previous Government's over-dependence on tightening legislation to prevent fraud rather than looking at people in the round was a mistake. The Bill opens the opportunity to provide people with support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Rendel 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I am the third or fourth hon. Member to welcome you to the Chair today, Mr. Malins. I am particularly pleased to do so because we recently sat together on another Committee. I think that it is fair to say that on that occasion you did not pick me up on a single point of procedure, which shows that you are extremely fair and very wise Chairman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also want to extend a warm welcome to my hon. Friend the Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten)—I think that he has not so far been welcomed by anybody, so it is right that I should do so—particularly as he has now recovered from the illness that, sadly, meant that he could not attend the previous Committee on which we were due to sit. I am pleased to see him in his place today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to help the Committee—I hope that it will help you too, Mr. Malins—by listing some aspects of the Bill on which we shall want to speak in more detail and some on which we shall speak less, so that you can see how we think that the Committee sittings should go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not expect to table many amendments to the pensions aspects of the Bill, which are dealt with in clauses 1 to 43, or to take up much of the Committee's time on them. I have no doubt that we shall table a number of probing amendments; indeed, one or two have already
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0481">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
been tabled. We shall want to investigate in greater detail some aspects of the way in which state earnings-related pensions scheme contributions are treated at present, and will be treated in future, and the payments that people can expect as a result of having made SERPS contributions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to spend most of our time on the remainder of the Bill and we want to change many provisions, particularly as we regard most of it as a case of severe benefit cutting and an increase in means-testing, to which we object strongly. It is true that we approve of some provisions. In particular, we are pleased at the extension of bereavement benefits to widowers and we shall not object to that. We also approve of the fact that that extends sex equality as the hon. Member for Colne Valley just said. We shall not table amendments to reject that change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there are strong objections to be made to the extent of the benefit cuts. I think that it was the Minister who said on Second Reading that we should not object to the cuts, as they were the means of paying for what we approve of. It is wrong to say that all those cuts are needed: they amount to some six times the total cost of the parts of the Bill of which we approve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not believe that clause 47, which is known as the single work-focused gateway, contains adequate safeguards, so we shall table amendments to add safeguards and we hope to spend time discussing that clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to spend most time on the remaining clauses, which deal with disability benefit cuts, in particular cuts to incapacity benefit. It has been said that those cuts are right, because too many people are taking incapacity benefits in place of retirement pensions. If that is so, the right way to deal with the problem is to ensure that people who are ineligible for the benefits do not get them, instead of cutting the level for everybody. That is the wrong way to do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that in future people will need to have made recent contributions to national insurance was described on Second Reading as getting nothing for something. That is a point that we shall want to make again in Committee when we reach that clause. Therefore, we shall want to spend some time on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also concerned about the clauses that introduce the means-testing of incapacity benefits against pensions, as we do not think that that is the right way to go either. Means-testing is the wrong way to deal with benefits, if they must be changed at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also object to the cutting of severe disablement allowance in clause 54, so I have no doubt that we shall table some amendments to that clause. We welcome the increase in the cut-off age to 25 for students or carers, which the Minister announced on Second Reading. However, there is a good case to be made for saying that the cut-off should not exist at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Overall, we shall table some amendments and shall wish to discuss in detail some of the later clauses. We shall not take up too much of the Committee's time in the early sittings. The overall total of £1.2 billion worth of cuts means that this is not a welfare reform but a welfare removal Bill. We strongly object to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric Pickles 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brentwood and Ongar)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the first time that I have had the pleasure of serving on a Committee under your chairmanship, Mr. Malins. I took the opportunity to watch you chair the Committee that considered the Social Security Contributions (Transfer of Functions, etc.) Bill, but I regret that I was unable to stay for long as I found the subject matter and the exchange between Labour and Opposition Members a little too exciting. I found it necessary to retire to a darkened room.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that the hon. Member for Doncaster, North, who is about to leave the Committee, will become a familiar figure to Committee members. As the Bill is effectively three bills, our deliberations will be long and we are likely to see more of the hon. Gentleman than of our families. So accustomed will we have come to him that, when we open our Easter eggs with happy little hands during the Easter recess, the moment will not be complete without his presence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened carefully, Mr. Malins, to your directions about not straying from the sittings motion. I have therefore jettisoned three quarters of what I was about to say. We must consider the Bill slowly and deliberately, however, to help not only members of the public but the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to refer briefly to the experience with a recent Bill, to show why the sittings motions should be absolutely right. We know from the newspapers that the Government have cold feet over the Tax Credits Bill. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and the Minister of Agriculture have grave reservations about it. The main reason is that the Committee that considered the Bill was allowed to develop points and to sit for a long period. Opposition Members are therefore not merely assisting the general public but giving the Government the opportunity—once they have realised their mistake on pensions and especially on widow's benefit—to abandon their proposals and return with improved ones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill represents a fundamental shift from national insurance to means-testing. For that reason, we will need a considerable amount of time to decide on the right course. The briefing that hon. Members received from the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux, which is directly relevant to the sittings motion, describes the position. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Before such a shift is made, the CB Service would like to see the Government make a clear statement on what sort of social security system it is trying to build and how National Insurance fits into its vision of work and security."</p></blockquote>
That could not be better put. The Government have not given much indication of their intentions in that respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Levitt 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(High Peak)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman accept that while means-testing may be a sin, targeting resources on those most in need is undeniably a virtue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Hon. Gentleman is missing the point if he thinks that Opposition Members believe that all means-testing is wrong. Our concern is the balance between means-testing and contributions. If the Committee acts as a teach-in for the Under-Secretary of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0482">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
State for Social Security, the hon. Member for City of York (Mr. Bayley), that is marvellous. It shows why we need to take things slowly. We do not mind helping the Government to progress on their learning curve—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend should not go too far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is too doctrinaire. I believe in a consensus in this context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Green Paper, on which the Government's proposals are based, was careful to say that it did not want a low-grade safety net for the destitute. However, the Bill's provisions make it clear that that is exactly the road down which we are travelling. That is clearest in the abolition of widow's pension and widow's benefit, which the Minister of State euphemistically said offered a time limit. The Government's proposal is a thin veneer, which will allow them to cut away at a vulnerable section of the community. Unlike other provisions relating to social security, a dramatic rise in the number of claimants is not involved. The number of widows claiming the benefit has dropped dramatically. In 1983, slightly more than 400,000 claimed it, but a couple of years ago slightly less than 300,000 claimed it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to go a little more slowly in our considerations for emotive reasons, which I shall put as nicely as I can. I do not believe that anyone who has experienced a bereavement—of an aunt, mother, sister or friend—could have drafted the Bill, which proposes an unrealistic way to deal with a person who is bereaved and terribly vulnerable. To lose a spouse is, I suspect, the cruellest blow that anyone can suffer, and it places particular hardship on widows. To subject widows to a means test after six months is unrealistic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The need for the Committee to proceed slowly in this context was put neatly in two sentences by the hon. Member for Newbury on Second Reading, which explains why we may have to sit well beyond Whitsun. I apologise to the hon. Gentleman for quoting him—I am a great support of his, and I do not want to damage his chances in his party's leadership contest. As someone with impeccable working-class roots, I think that it would be marvellous to see a toff lead a political party. On Second Reading, which was on 23 February, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In case any hon. Members thinks that six months sounds reasonable, let no one forget that a widow who knows that her bereavement allowance will run out after only six months will worry about how she will manage thereafter many months before it does run out. The restriction of the bereavement allowance to just six months is unnecessary and cruel, and an attack on human beings when they are at their most vulnerable."—[	<i>Official Report</i> 23 February 1999; Vol. 326, c. 245.]</p></blockquote>
That sums up the reasons why we shall have to spend an enormous length of time discussing the widow's benefit. The White Paper states that the proposals will affect older bereaved people in particular, especially women without dependent children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Concerns have also been expressed by the Social Security Advisory Committee, which said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The emphasis on…regaining financial independence through employment we regard as unrealistic."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
Many people offer support to older teenagers. The Green Paper says, "Do not worry about that. About 16 per cent. of widows receive incomes support"—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon.

I must ask him, please, to restrict his remarks to the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am so sorry, Mr. Malins. I entirely accept your rebuke. I was straying out of order, but that was because of the strong emotions—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was only apologising, Mr. Malins.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What slightly concerned me was that the hon. Gentleman said that he had thrown away three quarters of his speech, which he thought was outside the motion. No doubt he believes that the remaining quarter is within it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is absolutely right, Mr. Malins. I was in fear and trepidation when I saw the strict way in which you dealt with my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford and the hon. Member for Newbury. The hon. Member for Colne Valley was a model which I shall try to emulate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to other aspects of the problem. The hon. Member for Colne Valley said that the Bill introduces equality. I welcome the fact that the grants are being increased, as the hon. Member for Newbury said, but the hard truth is that it is based on the other spouse's income and women tend to earn less than men. That is one aspect that we must discuss.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill inevitably increases the level of dependency on means-tested benefits. Our concern is that that will result in a significant increase in the number of people who are not only caught in the poverty trap, but, as the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) said recently in the press, encapsulated in those means-tested benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Colne Valley said that the provision covering disability benefit is a matter of equality. Incapacity benefit will be affected if claimants have personal pensions, occupational pensions or other sources of income because that will be taken into consideration and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford said, those who save for the future will be penalised. It will not be worth saving. The Bill will put a raft of new people on to means-tested benefits and it will not be worth their while to save. During our proceedings, Conservative Members will try to find ways to make the system work. We are not against stakeholding—far from it—but it has not been properly thought out. We shall table amendments to try to ensure that it works and I suspect that clauses 1 to 7 will take several weeks to consider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that you are pleased, Mr. Malins, that I threw away three quarters of my speech. There will be more than adequate opportunity to raise these important matters. I repeat that it is our intention to improve the Bill and considerable time will be needed to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a sad mistake to have mixed the separate territories of pension reform and welfare reform. Both are crucial, but I shall concentrate now on pensions. It is all too easy for Members of Parliament and civil servants, who have generous occupational final salary pensions, to overlook the problem of adequate pension provision in the country as a whole. We must remember that the legislation will last a long time and will affect future generations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should declare an interest, which is not at a pensions consultant but as chairman of an investment management company. I am unhappy at the lack of a consultation period in respect of pension reform. Problems arising from the legislation and from pension mis-selling have encouraged the industry to think hard about getting the legislation right. Pensions could have been separated into two categories within the stakeholder concept: occupational pensions, which are related to the final salary, or the simpler and cheaper provision of "DIY" pensions. Stakeholder schemes are supposedly pension arrangements for those who are earning but have no pension provision. Most of the people in that category are self-employed and cannot, by definition, belong to a company scheme. Separate arrangements exist for carers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government claimed that the concept of the LISA was integral to the Green Paper. That announcement seemed to shine a ray of light on dealing properly with the self-employed. Those who campaigned for the arrangement intended it to be simple and analogous to the personal equity plan, which will shortly become the individual savings account. Simple rules would have governed the appropriateness of an investment, but a self-employed person could have gone through a LISA wrapper, saved for retirement and, upon retirement, bought an annuity or operated a draw-down arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, that appears not to be the intention. Whether a stakeholder pension should have a trustee is central to the issue. According to the Bill. LISAs appear simply to be a way of managing money, but methods of managing pension portfolios, such as unitised trusts, already exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The lack of consultation and the different approaches taken by the Treasury and the Department of Social Security have resulted in the dropping of a terrible clanger. An opportunity has been missed for rational reform and the provision of low-cost pension arrangements, which is the ultimate objective of the stakeholder concept. Trustees, trustee reporting and associated paraphernalia inevitably increase costs. Where both pension trustee and fund management aspects must be paid for, charges will increase, regardless of any provisions for maximum charges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Again, that is right outside the sittings motion. I must ask hon. Members to stay within it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Had the full time for consultation been allowed, some important comments and proposals from the Committee would have emerged as we went through the pensions section. The Government had 20 months to prepare their Green Paper, which was delayed on several occasions. Clearly, it has stirred up a great deal of thought among all concerned. When we address the pension clauses and, in particular, the stakeholder clauses, will the Minister consider what I have said and the need for substantial amendment of the Bill to achieve a simple, low-cost pension for the self-employed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In considering the sittings motion, I thought that it might be interesting to see what the Government's explanatory notes say. Paragraph 3 of the introduction states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Because this Bill contains a large number of provisions, covering several subject areas, each of the main areas is introduced and described separately in the notes."</p></blockquote>
In other words, we have before us, as my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford so cogently put it, three Bills welded together, each of which will require as much consideration as a whole Bill normally would.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You rightly restrained me earlier, Mr. Malins, from straying to the Family Law Act 1996. However, I want to illustrate why, besides the welfare and pensions, which the explanatory notes show are two separate areas, pension splitting is a separate area, which will need a huge amount of consideration on its own. We shall be considering the whole nature of the divorce process, which is far removed from the two other main sections of the Bill. The previous Government said that it was extremely complicated and difficult, and should be treated separately from their main measures on divorce. To tack it on to a Bill dealing with welfare and other more general pension matters presents a huge challenge to this Committee in the coming weeks. As we shall be still hard at it in the spillover after the summer recess, the Ministers will have the opportunity for further consultation on that subject, which mercifully comes towards the end of the Bill. That will help to make up for the premature curtailing of the consultation on earlier provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the duties of Standing Committee members is to deal with the correspondence that comes to them when they are considering a Bill. Given the huge amount of ground covered by the Bill and the fact that the consultation period was curtailed, we will need a great deal of time to fill in the gaps from that consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to clarify the record, as the Minister went a little wide in his opening remarks. He said that a number of Conservative Members in the Committee had strongly attacked the introduction by the previous Government of means-testing. That is true, although had he been his normal charitable self, he would have mentioned that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0484">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
measures were introduced in 1988, when most of us had only just arrived in the House of Commons—[Hon. Members: "Oh, that's all right then."]—I hope that Back-Bench Members of this Standing Committee, all of whom have at least a year's more experience in the House than I had in 1988, will show some independence of spirit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I doubt it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are hoping.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members have published many papers attacking means-testing. I have published four that have been reviewed in the broadsheet press. As we consider the provision, week after week, Labour Members must be clear that the bulk of the Bill takes the welfare state several steps further down the road that we began to go down in 1988.. many of their hon. Friends rightly predicted at the time, as did a number of Conservative colleagues, including Sir Brandon Rhys Williams, who is sadly no longer with us, that it would have consequences for increasing dependency. As we look hard over the next few weeks at pension and welfare provisions, it will be very much part of my duty to explain in detail why they will increase dependency and reduce thrift. For that reason, this will have to be a very long Standing Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make one point that is directly relevant to the sittings motion. I do not intend to deal with the substance or merits of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some members of the Committee, like members of Select Committees, have devoted a considerable portion of their life to considering pension splitting on divorce, and we produced a well-received and detailed report. One of my many interests in the Bill is to ensure that we have adequate and full debate on pension splitting on divorce, which is an immensely complicated procedure. I have my own criticisms of it, which I do not need to go into now, but the provision could affect many millions of people in the next 50 years. The courts have traditionally found it difficult to intervene and we are opening up new ground. Without trying to be alarmist, I have always felt that this provision was a similar issue to the Child Support Agency, although not as disastrous. Therefore, I want to ensure that we have a full debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are some controversial aspects early in the Bill, which, in view of what hon. Members have said, we shall have to debate at considerable length. I have one concern and I hope that the Minister can give me a commitment now, because pensions splitting on divorce is so important and is not a party political issue. I am fearful that at some stage the Government may say, "We have debated this for so many hours. We shall now move a guillotine and we shall do so before we reach pension splitting on divorce." From previous experience I know that one moves suddenly into a guillotine timetable, where debate is severely curtailed. We could rightly spend a considerable amount of time—I make no complaint about it—on the earlier aspects of the Bill, which are politically contentious, and then have a hugely curtailed debate on pension splitting on divorce, which would not accord it
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
the importance that it merits. Therefore, I hope that the Government will give a commitment that, whatever happens, the House will not fail in its duty to allow the Committee to devote the right amount of time to the debates on pension splitting on divorce.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to respond briefly to some of the points that have been raised in this interesting debate. The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford said at the start of his speech that he thought that we should have three sittings motion debates. I think that the length of his speech was roughly equivalent to five and, although I will not replicate that, I make no apology for the fact that this is a wide-ranging, radical and far-reaching Bill. The Government are ambitious. We want to change the way in which the welfare system works by modernising and reforming it. The Bill is an important step in the right direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was grateful for the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Colne Valley. She spoke of her enthusiasm for sitting on the Committee and we look forward with enthusiasm to her contributions to our deliberations. I was especially grateful to her for eliciting from the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford the withdrawal of his misleading remark about children. The Bill contains important improvements for the position of children. The well-being of children is a central concern of the Government. I was also grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for High Peak (Mr. Levitt) for his intervention, which caused a good deal of confusion among Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to respond to one point that is particularly relevant to the motion. The hon. Members for Grantham and Stamford and for Arundel and South Downs suggested that there had been inadequate consultation. There is some misunderstanding about the background and it is important that I set the record straight. There was thorough consultation on the framework for stakeholder pensions. Opposition Members should know that a consultation paper on stakeholder pensions was issued in November 1997. It received more than 200 detailed responses, which were taken into account when we developed the Green Paper proposals and the framework that is in the Bill. There have also been extensive discussions with representatives of the pensions industry. Full consultation has taken place on the measures before us. Beyond the framework in the Bill there will be—as there always is with pensions legislation—a raft of regulations. The consultation period is continuing to help to develop those.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford mentioned the National Association of Pension Funds. I met its chairman for the second time last week. I can reassure the hon. Gentleman that there are no complaints from the NAPF or any other part of the industry about the haste with which the process is proceeding. The commitment in the Queen's Speech to legislate on stakeholder pensions is honoured in the Bill. Hon. Members on the Committee and elsewhere will want to move swiftly to improve the woefully inadequate availability of funded pensions. There are many people
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0485">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
for whom no appropriate funded pension is available. It is time for that to change. We are moving quickly, on the basis of full and thorough consultation, to put that right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the time that stakeholder contributions were invited and received last November, the LISA proposal was not an option; it came later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The measures represent the results of the full consultation on the proposals that were published in November 1997. The Green Paper, "A new contract for welfare: PARTNERSHIP IN PENSIONS," made a clear and full reference to the fact that the Treasury would issue a consultation paper—I refer the hon. Gentleman to paragraphs 38 and 39 on page 55. That is what has happened. The Treasury consultation document, which was issued and launched jointly by the Chancellor and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, makes it clear that no primary legislation is required to implement its contents; only secondary legislation is required. That is why the Bill contains nothing on that point. In response to the point made by the hon. Member for Gainsborough, I am confident that ample time will be available to consider all the measures in the Bill. At a relatively early stage of our deliberations we shall consider the measures on pension splitting on divorce. I want to speak briefly about that in a moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister made a point about regulations in relation to the LISA and the stakeholder. Will he give the Committee an indication of the timing of those regulations? Will we have an opportunity to see some of the regulations in conjunction with the Bill, so that we can understand their implementation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We envisage that a series of consultation documents will be issued. Some of those will be issued before all stages of the Bill are complete, but the pattern that we are following is similar to that which was followed in previous pensions legislation. The framework in the Bill alone will allow the Committee to reach firm conclusions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are there any consultations or draft regulations that the Committee might be able to see in relation to early clauses? If so, our deliberations would be speeded up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it would not be appropriate to do so. Consultation documents will be issued before the summer and draft regulations will be published according to the normal process, which is similar to that which was followed in relation to the Pensions Act 1995.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On pension splitting divorce, I want to make one point to correct a misapprehension that could result from a remark made by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford. The Bill will not make pension sharing automatic; neither will the beneficiary gain a half share of the pension—the hon. Gentleman gave the example of a friend. Each case will be agreed by the parties or the courts, on the merits of the individual case. The Bill will make that possible in a way that did not exist in the past,
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
which is an important step forward. The key points are fairness and allowing pensions to be treated in the same way as other assets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill moves the welfare system in a radically different direction. We are changing the old passive system, which had many of the flaws that the hon. Gentleman had started to talk about—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister completes his peroration—he has been kind enough to mention my point—will he make one easy commitment? It would only be necessary for the Government to move a guillote if hon. Members were filibustering. It would be out of order for hon. Members to do so, however, and it would not therefore happen. Opposition Members are not going to filibuster anyway. Will the Minister make a commitment that a guillotine motion will not be introduced before we reach the issue of pension splitting on divorce? I am sure that he can make such a commitment with great ease.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If hon. Members look at the order of consideration motion, they will see that we will quickly reach the pension splitting on divorce measures, and I have no doubt that we will deal with them fully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill represents a radical change of direction for the welfare system. We inherited a passive system, which led to a number of the problems to which Opposition Members have rightly drawn attention. We want an active system, which is what the Bill will achieve. I look forward to our deliberations over the coming weeks, in accordance with the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to catch your eye at all, Mr. Malins. I will not speak for long, but in the light of the Minister's remarks I must make one point, which goes to the heart of our proceedings. I hope that we have a straightforward and honest debate and that we discuss in turn the important points that arise. If the Government find themselves in difficulty, I hope that they will not try to extricate themselves by sleight of hand. My criticism of the Government for not taking children into account in the provisions on pension-splitting is serous and valid. The Government were embarrassed about that, so the Minister rose to his feet and said that they are mentioned in another part of the Bill, but he was thinking of the mobility allowance, which is a different matter. Children are not mentioned in the pension splitting provisions and we shall try to ensure that they are. We do not want the Government to shilly-shally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the Minister said about the consultation exercise was more of the same and worse. I am aware that the Government produced a document in November 1997, but it was a list of questions, not legislative proposals. It contained no framework and it was not a consultation paper because there were no proposals on which to consult The Government did not know what they were doing at that stage, so they sent out a list of questions and received all sorts of answers. They then took a very long time—over a year—to produce the Green Paper. That was the document on which there was consultation and which carried a deadline of 31 March. It was the document on which people were set to work in the hope that they would be able to influence the proposals that the Government
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0486">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
were making for the first time. The Treasury then produced the LISA proposals a month or so ago, which were not anticipated in the original Green Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government did not allow the consultation period to expire before introducing the Bill. They cannot get away from the fact that the Green Paper had a consultation period and a deadline, and the Government have breached both. I had asked the National Association of Pension Funds for comments on the Bill and it stated in a letter dated 24 February:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"As you are aware, the NAPF is still in the process of drawing up its response to the Green Paper. It is unlikely that we shall submit our response until shortly before the 31 March deadline".

	<div class='title'>"MEANING OF STAKEHOLDER PENSION SCHEME"</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, amendment No. 1, in page 1, leave out lines 7 to 11 and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(a) A pension scheme is a stakeholder scheme for the purposes of this Part if it fulfils all the conditions of this section.'</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 1 establishes the concept of stakeholder pensions. The Government are in considerable confusion. The Department of Social Security has an
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
attachment to the idea of a stakeholder pension, which it states explicitly in its consultation document will be established by means of a trust. That is clear and there is no suggestion in the consultation document that any other formula or structure will be introduced and there is no statement that the Treasury will bring forward a non-trust-based alternative pension view. The DSS is committed to the idea of a trust. We believe that trusts form a valuable part of English law and have played a valuable part in our pensions industry and its history. This country's substantial pension provision—about £800 billion—which is largely managed by trusts, is extremely well managed, on the whole, on behalf of its beneficiaries. Of course, there have been some nasty scandals—for example, the Maxwell scandal. The previous Government rightly responded by strengthening the protection for those pension assets that exist under trust law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would have thought that there was common ground between the Opposition and the Government on that matter, but I do not know whether the Government have thought through the issues sufficiently to have a clear view on many of them. However, that is certainly the ground on which the Conservative party has stood and will continue to stand. Nothing in the amendment should be interpreted as casting aspersions on the validity of the trust system and its appropriateness for many sorts of pension vehicles, or on the excellent work done by unpaid trustees throughout the country, who sit on the boards of the many pension schemes. I pay tribute to their work, as I have had the privilege of meeting many of them in my present capacity as Opposition spokesman on the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, is it sensible to ensure that all stakeholder pensions are set up in the form of trusts? The Green Paper stated that that would be the case, but the Government do not really know. They have suggested that there should be a trust. However, clause 1(2) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The first condition is that the scheme is established under a trust"—</p></blockquote>
but it goes on—
	<br><blockquote><p>"or in such other way as may be prescribed."</p></blockquote>
If the Government continue to want all stakeholder schemes to be set up under a trust—they stated that in the Green Paper—presumably only the first few words of subsection (2) will be appropriate. However, if they think—as we do and as the Treasury and other Government Departments appear to do—that other vehicles may be equally appropriate, why mention a trust anyway? It seems otiose and potentially deceptive to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We established this morning that, unfortunately, the Government's attitude to welfare reform means that the number of people in whose interests it is to be involved in a stakeholder scheme is steadily reducing. However, we should make it as easy and cheap as possible for those people to become involved in such schemes. We want to move into the new regime with a minimum of disruption. We want a system that is not exclusive, but inclusive and that is not limiting but incremental. In other words, we want a system that will preserve the perfectly good pension provisions, pension instruments and pension
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0487">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
vehicles that exist and that will encourage people to make further contributions to them. However, were an alternative vehicle to be more appropriate or more attractive, for which there is no current provision, we would not only be open-minded but enthusiastic about the introduction of such provisions, and we would readily work with the Government on that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first part of the amendment deals with the right of the trustees of a personal pension scheme to adjust that scheme so as to ensure that it qualifies as a stakeholder pension. The Bill is ambiguous as to what qualifies as a stakeholder pension. A subsequent amendment deals with whether one could still be prevented from holding a stakeholder pension, whatever one did, because the Occupational Pensions Regulator Authority had refused to register the pension holder. However, that is covered by a subsequent amendment and I shall not dwell on it now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have tabled the amendment because we believe that, where existing pension vehicles serve their purpose, they should continue and should be subsumed in the new regime. People should not be discouraged from continuing to contribute to them least of all should such pensions be ruled out as an appropriate stakeholder scheme. Our approach, which is different from the Government's, is permissive rather than restrictive, particularly in regard to vehicles that have proved their worth in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 7 deals with the continuation of occupational pension schemes. Amendment No. 1 deals with personal pension schemes. In the regime that we believe would be appropriate—I see no reason why the Government should object to it and I hope that they are listening with a genuinely open mind—employers would have an obligation to make a stakeholder facility available to their employees: that is to say, they will make available information and a payroll deduction facility for pension provision. In a later amendment we seek a reduction, so that not all employers but only those employing more than 10 people would have that obligation. For reasons that I shall subsequently explain, we believe that it would not be appropriate for all employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, employers who have an obligation could allow employees to choose any appropriate vehicle and to set up the payroll deduction facility in response to that vehicle. Where the employee has a personal pension facility, perhaps because the employer does not offer an occupational pension or because the employee brought it from a previous employment or previous period of self-employment, it may be against his interests to have to abandon it and take up another personal pension or invest in another vehicle. It could be disruptive and expensive, because he may already have paid set-up charges that he was hoping would be amortised over his future working life. The charges will be spread over fewer years if he has to move out of that personal pension scheme and into something else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, we want to encourage the qualification of personal pension schemes as stakeholder pensions rather than exclude them a priori, as I fear will be the effect of the Bill. One can never be certain what the effect of a Bill
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
will be when it includes so much provision for so many regulations, which the Government have not told us about in advance. They have now said that they will not tell us about them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Throughout our proceedings, if I make a good case against a provision in the Bill, Labour Members will be able to stand up and say either that I am wrong for reasons X, Y and Z or, "The hon. Member is perfectly right, but the Government were proposing changes anyway. That is why we provided ourselves with this open-ended regulatory power." We shall play that game in every debate. I mention it now so that it will not come as a surprise to us if that is the response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we ignore the open-ended regulatory power, the Bill will exclude personal pensions, which would be extremely unreasonable and undesirable for individuals. We want people to have as wide a choice as possible. Where personal pensions are the most appropriate choice, we want the pension holder to be able to continue with it. The Minister of State may have two legitimate objections to that. He may say that, in some cases, the personal pension is not the best choice, that there is something better: it may be cheaper to move into a LISA. He is unlikely to say that, because the LISA is the Treasury's baby. I doubt whether we shall hear anything nice about LISAs during our debates. The Minister of State will say that his own trust-based, stakeholder pensions are the best choice. Where it is sensible to make a change, we are the first to say that the employee should be able to make it and that the change should be facilitated. Indeed, we have tabled amendments dealing with the cost of making such transfers. The presumption is that, where a person has a good pension scheme, it may not be sensible to change. There may be cost implications of changing, which would be negative, or the policy holder may be happy with the scheme and its fund management. He may say, "I don't want to be taken away from this fund management. It is doing rather well for me."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I anticipate that the objection will be that a personal pension is not appropriate. That is fine because our amendments would open choices to enable people to do what is in their best interest. I also anticipate the objection that in certain circumstances a personal pension scheme would not qualify as a stakeholder pension because it would be inappropriate. There is no point in taking up our time by considering various theoretical examples, such as what would happen if a scheme were run by Mr. Maxwell. The second half of the amendment provides for that. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority shall have the power to make rules to specify on what terms and under which conditions the power under subsection (1AA) may be exercised.</p></blockquote>
The amendment does not provide carte blanche—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is speaking to amendment No. 8, which he knows has not been selected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All our amendments serve the same objectives and fall within the same framework. Amendment No. 1 is, as you have rightly decided, Mr. Malins, the logical amendment with which to start our debate. It makes it clear that we want an open

	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
choice. The amendments that follow it would ensure that a LISA, a personal pension or an occupational pension, including a final salary-related occupational pension, are apart of the choices available. This extraordinary Bill is drafted in such a way that only pensions that offer money-purchase benefits can qualify as stakeholders. That must be wrong. Universal consensus among the pensions industry and pensions advisers is that salary-related schemes—if a person is lucky enough to have access to one—are extremely good value and, in most cases, the best value. The Government are, sadly, allowing those schemes to be run down, but I see no reason to exclude a salary-related occupational pension scheme. The permissive, facilitating provision that we wish to introduce is set out in the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend explain why the Government believe that a scheme established under trust is both better protected and more advantageous for the recipient than an alternative scheme? What merit is there in a trust? I am not aware of any merit but my hon. Friend, with his considerable knowledge, may be able to enlighten me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not always have an insight into what is in the mind of Labour Members. My hon. Friend raises a good point. However, it is not the Government who are obsessed with the idea of trust, but the Department of Social Security. The Treasury has issued a rival pension vehicle—the LISA—which the Department of Social Security does not like to mention, although I have referred to it several times this morning. It is extraordinary that that important alternative proposal, which was produced a few weeks after the Government's Green Paper, is not mentioned in the Bill because it does not involve a trust. A LISA allows a person to package a holding in a unit trust or a share in an investment trust or an open-ended investment company and treat it as a pension. That is an attractive idea. Indeed, other amendments will endeavour to make it clear that a LISA should also qualify as a stakeholder pension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why does the Treasury like LISAs? Because it understands the market better than the Department of Social Security. Why is the Department of Social Security so hung up on trusts? Either because it is a legacy from the past or because the Ministers, who are gentlemen in every sense of the word, are not experienced in aspects of financial markets that do not involve trusts and are unhappy about moving into them. That is my only explanation. Another explanation might be that parts of the Labour party remain attached to a traditional model that accounted for approximately 80 per cent. of the labour market 50 years ago, or 80 years ago, when the Labour party ceased to think. People stayed for a long time in labour-intensive industries with enormous work forces, such as coal mining and ship building. Because they were likely to stay together for most of their working lives and to continue to live in the same area, it was sensible for a pension scheme to embrace all such employees. The scheme could be administered easily and trustees with whom employees and former employees were familiar could be elected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That model is fine, but the labour market has moved away from it. People change jobs more frequently. As a result of technological progress, businesses are often less labour-intensive and more capital intensive. One no longer has large gatherings of employees who stay together. For such employees, a trust had obvious advantages that could not be exploited through the movement of individuals from one business to another or from one part of the country to another, through the different parts of the single market, and in other contexts such as self-employment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend is right: had we left unchallenged the Bill's restrictive drafting and the restrictive vision demonstrated in the Department of Social Security's Green Paper, the resulting trust-based stakeholder scheme would have been used only in connection with mis-selling. For example, it would have been used where an employer has to wind down an occupational pension scheme or a group personal pension scheme and replace it with a so-called stakeholder pension, or where—unless the amendment to which I prematurely referred were to be adopted—a personal pension is replaced with something less desirable than a stakeholder pension. That would be barmy and very damaging.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have not thought through the issue, and the lack of consultation has made the problem inevitable. Even if my hon. Friend and I were in Government, we would not have the arrogance to suppose that we knew everything. We would not introduce such a Bill before the consultation period had expired. We would want to hear what the National Association of Pension Funds, and groups such as trade unions and friendly societies had to say on the matter. We would want to hear from those sections of the industry that can exploit a trust-based stakeholder pension as the Government narrowly conceive it, from the unit trust and investment trust industries, or from the new OEICs—open-ended investment companies. Some people are more excited about the prospects associated with the Treasury's rival LISA scheme. The question is whether to adopt a restrictive or a permissive approach. If one adopts a permissive approach, one should agree to the amendment. We have also tabled other amendments that will leave out many of the clause's subsequent provisions.

Pension scheme and stakeholder scheme proposals will meet the clause's conditions. That suggests that the Bill should not require a scheme to have OPRA registration to qualify, which is a tricky issue. We have no objection to the idea of OPRA maintaining a register, or to it—or another appropriate regulator, such as the Financial Services Authority—overseeing the whole system and carefully investigating allegations of abuse. There must be an appropriate regulatory framework. We have considerable objections, however, to the idea of involving more than one regulatory authority. That would be unreasonable, either because differential burdens would be placed on different types of pension vehicle, further fragmenting the market and complicating individuals' choice, which is inherently undesirable, or because gaps would appear in the responsibilities of regulators. The clause means that anybody could offer a stakeholder pension so long as certain requirements were observed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If our amendments were agreed to, those requirements will be minimal but essential, and, importantly, registration will not be a requirement. If they are not agreed to, only those schemes that have been explicitly accepted by OPRA will be accepted as stakeholder pensions on day one of the Bill's enactment. Even if OPRA does its job conscientiously and thoroughly, as I am sure it will, a tremendous backlog of work will develop. It will take months—perhaps even years—to go through all the personal and occupational pension schemes in this country, whether final salary or money purchase. As I said, we will come to an Opposition amendment that will, I hope, rule out that anomaly. It will take months or years for all such schemes to be registered and to decide who can play in this pool, and that is not good for anyone.

The Government's proposals will produce a peculiar situation. An employer will have a legal obligation to provide a stakeholder pension but, because one or more of his employees has a personal pension that has not been registered by OPRA, for example, he will not be able to satisfy his legal obligation by pointing to an employee's existing personal pension. What will happen? The employer might say to the employee, "I am sorry, I shall be fined by OPRA unless you give up your personal pension tomorrow and take out a stakeholder pension." The employee might say, "For God's sake, the trustees tell me that OPRA has an appointment to see them in six weeks' time. It cannot come earlier, and I am sure that my personal pension, which is entirely respectable, will be duly registered."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment has two purposes: first, it would allow personal pensions to qualify; and, secondly, in combination with other amendments, which we shall discuss later, it would ensure that occupational pension schemes, final salary schemes and LISAs also qualify by meeting the clause's minimal requirements. Registration should not be an essential part of that mechanism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the amendment's purpose is clear and that the Government will accept it. They should do so, unless their real agenda is to have a restrictive version of the personal pension scheme, which will exclude vehicles that currently give good value, and to restrict rather than enhance the choice available to people who seek to provide for their retirement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
