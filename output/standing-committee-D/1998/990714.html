	<p>10 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Paul Murphy) </div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:
I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Draft North-South Cooperation (Implementation Bodies) (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order 1999.</p></blockquote>
The draft order was laid before the House on 28 June. It is entirely technical. Nevertheless, it is important in ensuring that all the north-south implementation bodies, which are an important aspect of the Good Friday agreement, can operate in the manner that was agreed by the political leaders—north and south—and endorsed by the Assembly and the Dail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government and the Irish Government signed the implementation bodies agreement in Dublin on 8 March 1999. It provided for the establishment of north-south implementation bodies, as proposed under strand II of the Good Friday agreement. The North-South Co-operation (Implementation Bodies) (Northern Ireland) Order 1999, which gives effect in domestic law to the agreement, was passed by the House on 8 March and made on 10 March.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agreement provided for the establishment of six bodies, including an implementation body for special European Union programmes. That body is to have several functions in relation to the structural funds' community initiative programmes, which benefit Northern Ireland, including the new round of community initiatives after 1999.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As detailed in the agreement, it was expected that any successor to the current peace programme would be in the form of a community initiative and would, therefore, fall within the terms of the treaty and the previous order. At the Berlin European Council of 25–26 March, provision was made for the continuation of the PEACE programme, but not as a community initiative. The European Commission's draft regulations for implementation of the Berlin conclusions of 29 March showed that the proposed allocation of 500 million euros for the new PEACE programme would not come from the separate and distinct community initiatives budget but from the European Union's mainstream objective 1 budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To ensure that the implementation body has the authority to fulfil the relevant functions in regard to the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
PEACE programme after 1999—as was the clear intention of both Governments—it has been necessary to clarify the interpretation of the original treaty agreement in respect of the establishment of the bodies involved. That was done by means of an exchange of letters between my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Ireland on 18 June this year. That exchange confirmed that the treaty should be construed as including any successor to the PEACE programme established within the framework of European Community structural funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next and final step in clarifying the matter is for both Governments to bring the exchange of letters within the terms of their associated domestic legislation, hence, the draft order that we are considering. The Irish Government have drafted an equivalent amendment Bill, which both Houses of the Oireachtas passed on 24 June 1999. The text of the exchange of letters is in schedule 1A of the draft order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said at the outset, it is important that this technical matter is resolved satisfactorily. We want the Good Friday agreement to be implemented in full. That is why we took the Northern Ireland Bill through the House last night and in the early hours of this morning. Implementing the agreement means not only getting the institutions up and running, but ensuring that they can carry out all the functions for which they were established. That is the purpose of the short draft order and the reason why I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.4 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Moss 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Cambridgeshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that explanation. I will not detain the Committee for long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to ask the Minister a couple of questions for the purpose of clarification. When he talks about the PEACE programme, is he referring to the peace and reconciliation programme funded by the EU some years ago? Has that programme's name been changed; is he talking about a continuation of that programme?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do the Government, though the agreement, intend the PEACE programme to be implemented exclusively through the north-south bodies, or is there a different and separate means of implementation? Is there territorial integrity—if north-south bodies are involved, will the money be invested exclusively in the territory of Northern Ireland or will it, as happens with some Interreg funds, be used for cross-border activities and programmes? While I am on the subject of Interreg funds, will they continue under new agreements for structural funds? If so, will the Minister clarify how those funds are to be administered in future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.5 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Wilshire 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Spelthorne)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would be grateful for answers to several queries. If we are to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0477">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
vote on the order, it is important that those of us who do not deal with the Province as much as the Minister and my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss) know exactly with what we are dealing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, the order refers simply to PEACE. To start, I would like to know who asked for that change—the British Government or the Government of the Republic? It is important to know that, because significant implications arise from understanding who asked the British Parliament to make changes to a document with ramifications for a foreign nation, giving that nation a say over sovereign territory of the United Kingdom. Did the Government of the independent nation of the Republic of Ireland come forward and say, "Please could we co-operate?" or did the British Government realise that they had got their drafting wrong? I shall return to the question of sloppy drafting later, if I may. The Minister mentioned, the Good Friday agreement and I wish to say something about that later, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another issue arises from the question of whether the order is necessary. The order reminds us that the EU, whose funds we are considering, seeks to treat the island of Ireland as one region—it considers it to be one place, with one group of people, one economy and one future. We cannot allow this morning to pass without commenting that, in that, we have another example of Parliament being asked to pass an order to give effect to the concept of there being one region in the EU called Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of us have spent much time trying to persuade the EU that the concept of a Europe of the regions is an absolute nonsense and that it undermines the sovereignty of individual member states. The order is one more move in the direction of that concept. We have also tried to persuade the EU that the island of Ireland is not united—that there are two peoples, with different histories and cultures. Were the EU to tell the Italians and the French that they were one group of people living in one place and that they should be treated as one, there would—quite properly—be enormous outrage. Our dealing with an order that seeks to give effect to the fallacious concept of one region called Ireland should not pass without my protest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister told us that the order was necessary to give effect to the Good Friday agreement. However, as I understand it the original order, a fairly lengthy document, was produced to give effect to the agreement. Will the Minister confirm that the original order was introduced because of the Good Friday agreement? If that is so, and if, as the Minister said this morning, the order before us is intended to amend the original order, we are faced with an example of the Good Friday agreement being modified to suit the purposes of the British Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why I want to know whether the modification was sought by the Dublin Government.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
Yesterday, when hon. Gentlemens such as the hon. Member for Lagan Valley (Mr. Donaldson) tried to suggest that the Good Friday agreement should be modified, they spent eight hours being told that that was not possible—that an agreement was an agreement and it could not be modified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At 10 o'clock this morning, however, the Minister stands up and says "I want this order to modify the Good Friday agreement." That tells us a good deal about what has been going on in the House yesterday and today. It tells us that when the Dublin Government want something, right hon. and hon. Members have to be dragged here at 10 o'clock in the morning, when it is hoped that we will say nothing and that we will rubber stamp a change to the Good Friday agreement. Last night, when Unionists sought such a change, nothing happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister owes us an explanation. Why can a foreign government demand and obtain an amendment to the Good Friday agreement when duly elected Members of Parliament who speak for the majority of people in a province of this nation are told for eight hours that they cannot have a change because an agreement is an agreement? Such an approach seems absolute nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I venture to suggest that one of the reasons for that approach is that the hon. Member for Lagan Valley and his colleagues, who are wedded to democracy and peaceful means of resolution, do not have guns to hold to Ministers' heads and explosives to put under their cars. When these are involved, we come here at 10 o'clock in morning to make changes. When one tries to use the democratic process, however, one is told, "Absolutely not."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are some of the preliminary matters that the Minister must explain. When he has done so, he must remember that successive Governments have been wedded to clear English. I was up late last night, but I lost even more sleep by trying to get my mind around both the original order and the draft order before us. As expected, both contain explanations of particular sets of initials, but some acronyms, are not explained. It is not good enough to assume that the few people who show an interest in the subject understand everything. We owe the people who need to consult the orders some explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have an explanation of community initiatives, or CIs. At the beginning of part IV on page 11 of the original order, which is the bit that we are seeking to amend, I noticed a reference to Interreg. Some people are well aware what that means, but I am not. I understand merely that it is another EU interference in the sovereign affairs of members states.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is not discussing the draft order before us, but a different order. I know that he will look at the title, and that he will return to order. I have given him a lot of room, but he must keep in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0478">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilshire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate your earlier generosity, Mr. Jones. I had something to get off my chest and you have kindly allowed me to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft order and its schedule refer to PEACE as an acronym and to another acronym in the original order. I accept your point, Mr. Jones, about other acronyms, except to state that I should be grateful for an explanation of them. The existing order and the draft order both refer to PEACE. If we are to amend the existing order and to bring the PEACE programme within its scope, the Minister should tell the Committee what it is. If we are to give the body the power to deal with it, we should be given an explanation of what has happened in the past. What projects have there been, how many were there, and where were they sited? What has happened to them? How much taxpayers' money—European and British—has been spent on the PEACE programme?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are being told that the original order, when it is amended, has to relate to the future PEACE programme, we should also be told the expectations of the British Government in relation to any such programme. What exactly is going to happen under the order? Who can apply for the programme? How do they apply? What sort of application do they have to send in? What sort of details do they have to supply? What is required in terms of independent costings and verification?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should be told how, when the order has been amended, decisions will be taken using the new powers that we have granted to the body. My hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire raised relevant points in that respect. Will the projects be exclusively in Northern Ireland, exclusively in the Republic of Ireland, or cross-border? I have some knowledge of such matters because I served for a number of years on the Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs. I am aware of some of the cross-border work that has been done, and I applaud it. However, we need to be told whether the new powers will be used for projects exclusively in Northern Ireland. If so, how many will there be, how much will they cost and where will they be? The body is made up of representatives of the two sovereign nations, yet the order gives powers to the republic of Ireland to decide matters that relate exclusively to Northern Ireland. Why does the Minister consider that to be appropriate?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 6 on page 19 of the original order states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Body will have all the powers necessary for, or incidental to, the exercise of its functions."</p></blockquote>
If, by approving the draft order, we are to extend the body's scope to a new range of matters, we should be told what those powers are. I do not like voting for a measure that gives a body "all the powers necessary"—that phrase sounds draconian, and not at all democratic. The Minister therefore owes us an explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
referring to the original order. He must return to the order that we are debating today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilshire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of the dangers of challenging that ruling, Mr. Jones. However, we have before us an order that states that a new set of powers will be given to a body. We are therefore entitled to ask what the body's powers will be before we vote on the order and handover new matters for it to deal with. The phrase "all the powers necessary" will then refer to the new matters on which we are being asked to vote this morning. It is in that spirit, Mr. Jones, that I am making my remarks. Rather than attempting to debate the original order, I am trying to clarify the powers that we are dealing with in approving the order before us and thereby giving the body these new responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand your ruling, Mr. Jones, and I shall not pursue the matter any further. However, I shall, if I may, refer to the original order. I am treading as carefully as possible to make it clear that it is the draft order that is at stake. The draft order also has to be considered in relation to the exercise of functions on page 18 of the original order. I should be grateful if the Minister explained how the powers that are set out there are relevant to the draft order and what will happen when the new matters are included in the responsibilities of the body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another issue that needs clarifying. We are told that the new initiatives will pass to the body, so it is relevant to know who will exercise the powers being granted by the draft order. Who are the members of the body whom we are being asked to provide with additional powers? Who appoints the people whom we are being asked to provide with additional powers? How will the body be funded? Will it be through British taxpayers' money, Irish taxpayers' money, or will it be a mixture? What are the proportions: will British taxpayers be paying more than their fair share, which is usually the case when it comes to these matters? We pay the bills, and we get all the stick. That is an important point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we give this body extra powers, I should like to know whether we are handing powers to an unelected group of people—which is what I assume they are—who will then have direct power over part of the sovereign territory of the United Kingdom, without any reference back to those who were elected to represent the people of Northern Ireland. If so, that is a disgrace, and I want nothing to do with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am keen to make absolutely certain that I fully understand what I am being asked to vote for. Will the Minister confirm that the draft order makes three changes? The first change comes under the heading:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Amendments to the principal Order",</p></blockquote>
in which article 2(2) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In Article 3 (the Agreement) at the end insert-</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"(4) In this Order "supplementary Agreement" means the Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of Ireland
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0479">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
constituted by the exchange of letters dated 18 June 1999, the texts of which are set out in Schedule 1A."."</p></blockquote>
Am I correct in believing that that is the first of the changes we are being asked to make this morning?

Again, if I understand correctly, the second change that we are being asked to make is to be found in article 2(3), which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In Article 14 (the implementation body for special EU programmes) at the beginning of paragraphs (2) and (3) insert "Subject to paragraph (3A)," and after paragraph (3) insert-</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3A) For the purpose of paragraphs (2) and (3), Part 4 of Annex 1 and Part 4 of Annex 2 to the Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the supplementary Agreement."."</p></blockquote>
I should be grateful if the Minister would tell me if I am correct in believing that that is the second change. If so, members of the Committee will understand why I lost so much sleep last night trying to understand what on earth this was all about. Am I correct in understanding that the third change that we are being asked to make is to be found in article 2(4). which states
	<br><blockquote><p>"After Schedule 1 (text of the Agreement) there shall be inserted the Schedule set out in the Schedule to this Order."</p></blockquote>
We turn over the page, and there is the schedule. I suspect, however, that if I tried to read the entire schedule into the record, I might try your patience little too far, Mr. Jones, so I shall not run that risk. I shall merely ask the Minister to tell me whether I understand the provision correctly, and that the third of the changes that we are being asked to make is to be found there and involves the inclusion of the schedule that is set out on page 2 of the draft order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For my sins, I serve on the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs, and it is my lot to see the large amount of paperwork that swills around between Foreign Ministers, foreign Ministries and embassies. The order is a classic example of such paperwork. Can the Minister tell us why it is necessary to use up so much paper with all this flowery language? "I have the honour to this" and "I have the honour to that"—round and round it goes. All we need is one crisp, short sentence stating what we are trying to achieve. If the paperwork had contained one crisp, short sentence, my contribution to the debate might also have been expressed in one crisp, short sentence. But because we have been given all this gobbledygook and flowery language, it has been necessary to press the Minister. I look forward to his answers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jeffrey Donaldson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lagan Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I echo the comments of the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire, who talked about the importance of maintaining the territorial integrity of the United Kingdom in the context of developing the implementation bodies. I hope that the Minister can assure us that, whatever programmes are developed in terms of implementation bodies in general—specifically including the EU programmes that will fall under this particular implementation
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
body—the territorial integrity of Northern Ireland will be upheld by his Government and respected by the Irish Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Belfast agreement gave rise to the implementation bodies in strand II. It proposed the formation of a North-South Ministerial Council and under that, the establishment of a number of implementation bodies to take forward various programmes and initiatives to promote co-operation between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. One of those programmes involved EU matters, with which the order deals. As I understand it, the purpose of the order is to update the manner of those EU programmes in accordance with recent changes made as a result of the Berlin summit. Thus, the order will bring the proposals for an implementation body dealing with the EU matters into line with what was agreed in Berlin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given my constituency and my Unionist perspective, I want the Minister's assurance that the implementation body that is being established to deal with EU programmes will, under its operational remit, ensure that those programmes are applied fairly and even-handedly. The Belfast agreement says that the implementation bodies will have a "clear operational remit". I hope that the Minister will clarify the operational remit of this particular implementation body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part of that remit is to ensure that there is balance and equity in the application of those funds to the two traditions in Northern Ireland. That has not been the case in the past—there has been an imbalance: areas where there is a higher proportion of Unionists tend to get a lesser share of the funding from EU programmes. I hope that the new body will address that issue and that EU programmes will be applied more equitably in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The EU programmes were developed in Northern Ireland to promote peace and reconciliation. Surely among the most important tenets of reconciliation are that people feel that they are getting a fair deal, that we have an equitable society, and that the application of funding from EU programmes is fair and balanced. I hope that the Minister will reassure the Unionist community that the implementation's body's operational remit will be applied in a fair and equitable manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scrutiny is also important. It is important that implementation bodies are properly scrutinised if the Northern Ireland Assembly gets off the ground and power is transferred, and that that scrutiny is above board. We in Northern Ireland have laboured under government by the Anglo-Irish process. The Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference has been less than open in its dealings. I hope that that will not be the case with the new implementation bodies and that they will be open to scrutiny, not only by the Assembly, but by the general public. Will the Minister confirm whether part of the operational remit of the implementation body for EU matters will be a

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
requirement to make annual reports on the application of funding from EU programmes and clarify whether that will be assessed on the basis of the apportioning of funding to the Unionist and nationalist traditions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will also be aware of the draft treaty that was mentioned in the House of Commons yesterday. It relates to the implementation bodies and to the North-South Ministerial Council. The draft treaty, which is in the form of an exchange of letters between the British and Irish Governments, deals with the failsafe mechanism. If the Assembly is suspended because someone defaults on his commitments, that mechanism will apply also to the North-South Ministerial Council and to the implementation bodies. Will the Minister clarify what effect the draft treaty and the exchange of letters between the British and Irish Governments will have on the implementation body, should a party be in default in the Northern Ireland Assembly, with the result that the failsafe mechanism is applied to the north-south implementation bodies and, in particular, to that body proposed in the order? I look forward to the Minister providing clarification on those matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.32 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting short debate on important issues. I shall refer first to the significant questions raised by the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire. He asked whether the PEACE programme was the successor to the peace and reconciliation programme that has been going in Northern Ireland since 1995. The answer to that is, yes, it is. I will give more detail on that when I answer the hon. Member for Spelthorne (Mr. Wilshire).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire went on to ask whether the north-south implementation body for European Union matters would administer the funding of the new PEACE programme. The answer to that is again, yes, it is. The PEACE funding is cross-border. From 1995 to this year, 500 million euros of peace and reconciliation funding have come to Northern Ireland and the border regions. Some £260 million went to Northern Ireland and £65 million went to the border counties in the Republic. Of that, £80 million had to be co-funded by the Northern Ireland Office and £20 million by the Republic of Ireland. There is, therefore, no real difference in the way in which the money is distributed, because these are cross-border moneys and have been for some time. I will give more detail on that in a few seconds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire then asked about territorial integrity, to which the hon. Member for Lagan Valley also referred. Again, the implementation body for European moneys deals with two things—the PEACE programme and the Interreg programme. Interreg is a regional programme, which is not confined to the island of Ireland; it operates in many other countries in the European Union which
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
have obvious cross-border similarities and economic and social problems within the purview of the EU.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilshire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to the Minister, because by default, I seem to have been given a definition of Interreg. However, I understand that the EU treats the island of Ireland as a single region, so how can the EU provide interregional funds within a single region?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a region. The Republic of Ireland is an independent, sovereign member state of the EU. Obviously, the process by which funds that go to the island of Ireland as a consequence of cross-border funding is unusual; the peace and reconciliation programme is unique in receiving such funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Spelthorne asked who requested the change. Of course, the change was a direct result of the EU stating that the money used for the programme will now come from objective 1 funds instead of the community initiatives budget. That is of little interest to the bodies that receive the EU funding; they do not care from which fund the money comes, so long as they receive it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More than 20,000 applications for assistance from the peace and reconciliation fund have been submitted in the past few years, and we expect an equal number to be made in the years ahead. Therefore, the hon. Member for Spelthorne will understand—as I am sure to other members of the Committee—that enormous support exists across the social and political spectrum in Northern Ireland for what has occurred because of the peace and reconciliation fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Members of the European Parliament, who represent different traditions in Northern Ireland, have all been uniquely significant in ensuring that the new PEACE programme has been resolved. The entire Northern Ireland Assembly visited Brussels before Christmas and, at the same time, the right hon. Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble) and the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh (Mr. Mallon)—as First Minister and Deputy First Minister—and myself visited the President of the Commission, and other commissioners and important people who have to take the decisions about such matters. We were all as one in trying to ensure that we achieved the best possible deal for Northern Ireland in the new PEACE programme. The political parties in Northern Ireland are not divided about the need for extra funding from Europe. That funding is, by its nature, cross border as well as for Northern Ireland itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The EU implementation body—one of the six bodies agreed by the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister and then by the Assembly—was discussed in great detail at Christmas and not long afterwards. The agreement that the body should deal with the PEACE money came not from this Government—nor, indeed, from the Irish Government—but from the Administration-in-waiting in Northern Ireland. They agreed that it should be one
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0481">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
of the implementation bodies. They wanted the scheme to be implemented by that body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We now have embarked on a significant consultation exercise in Northern Ireland to ensure that we achieve that best possible value from the new PEACE programme. Hundreds of people from across the social and economic spectrum in Northern Ireland, irrespective of their religion or politics, attended the conference that we held in May. Every political party—however large or small—in Northern Ireland is involved in that substantial consultation exercise. All the parties are as one in wanting to ensure that we get that money for Northern Ireland, because it will be of enormous social and economic value to the people of Northern Ireland, as was the previous programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Spelthorne raised other issues, such as the letters that were exchanged between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. I understand that that is normal diplomatic usage. I do not think it will be of great interest to the people of Northern Ireland. They are interested in the fact that they will be able to use many millions of pounds to try to ensure that they can improve the quality of their lives. There is no disagreement between the politicians of all hues who are dealing with the matter in Northern Ireland
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Lagan Valley rightly raised the issue of the take-up among the Unionist community in Northern Ireland. That concerns the Government as well as his party, and I have held meetings about it with public representatives from local authorities and the Assembly. There are ways in which we can encourage applications for funding. The big problem has not so much been an unwillingness for the funding to go across the geographical and political spectrum, but that applications simply have not come from those areas that are generally regarded as being Unionist. We are trying to devise methods by which we can improve the take-up and the number of applications through community groups and others from the areas to which the hon. Gentleman referred. I understand the point that he makes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
The other difficulty that we face is that, because of the nature of economic and social deprivation in Northern Ireland, there is a tendency for the constituencies and districts west of the Bann to be heavily concentrated in areas that are so defined. I am sure that the hon. Member for Lagan Valley will understand that, even in the wealthiest parts of eastern Northern Ireland, pockets exist that could qualify for assistance from the fund, and we shall do our best to ensure that they receive it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Lagan Valley raised the issue of the failsafe, the EU body being an implementation body, the North-South Ministerial Council and so on. The House dealt with the Northern Ireland Bill last night, and it is now before the other place. The Bill, the schedule to it and the agreement that is lodged with the Library refer to a two-stage arrangement. If suspension occurs—we all hope that it will not—the North-South Ministerial Council, to which the implementation bodies are accountable, will cease to function, as will all the other institutions referred to in the Bill. No new initiatives, policy directives—nothing novel or unique—can be determined by the implementation bodies. They will effectively tick over until four months have elapsed, when they will be dissolved and their functions passed to the respective sovereign Governments. There are legal, administrative and technical reasons for that gap connected with winding down bodies that have been set up by law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we said in debates on the Northern Ireland Act 1998, if there were no Ministerial Council to which those bodies could be accountable, they would eventually have to go—the only caveat being that those bodies that have existed for some time, such those for Carlingford Lough, fisheries and the lighthouses around the island of Ireland, would remain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
