	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Advocate General for Scotland (Dr. Lynda Clark)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Scottish Parliament (Assistance for Registered Political Parties) Order 1999.</p></blockquote>
The order was laid before Parliament by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland on 26 May. It provides for the payment of more than one third of a million pounds to political parties in the Scottish Parliament during the next nine months. In moving the order, I am aware that it has already been the subject of some controversy. No doubt we shall have a lively debate on it, although I hope that it will be short. To help inform that debate, I shall briefly explain the order's contents and background.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recommendation 44 of the Neill committee's fifth report, which was published in October 1998, stated that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The political parties within the Scottish Parliament … should consider making provision for their financial support from the available parliamentary … funds for … the better performance of their parliamentary … functions."</p></blockquote>
The Committee will recall that, because the Scotland Bill received Royal Assent in early November, the Government had very little time to react to the Neill committee report. However, the Government did react by tabling an amendment that became section 97 of the Scotland Act. That amendment was welcomed on all sides and ensured that the power to support the parties represented in the Scottish Parliament would exist from the start of the Parliament's life. The order before us is made under powers conferred by section 97.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 97 of the Scotland Act fulfilled a short-term need, but the Government have always recognised that more fundamental change is necessary to meet the Neill committee's recommendation that the Scottish Parliament should be able to take such decisions itself. The Committee will doubtless recall that, under the Scotland Act, the funding of political parties is a reserved matter. Therefore, to fulfil the Neill committee's recommendation, we must give the Scottish Parliament legislative competence over that issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is exactly what the Government want to do. Tomorrow, we hope to confer the necessary legislative competence on the Scottish Parliament and widen its powers by amending the Scotland Act through the tabling of a separate order under section 30(2) of the Act. That order will be considered by the Fifth Standing Committee tomorrow morning. If the order
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
is approved, from 1 July the Scottish Parliament will be able to formulate and introduce its own scheme by using its own primary legislation powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until the Scottish Parliament chooses to draw up its own scheme and pass the necessary Act, the order will provide an initial scheme of support. It will ensure that the parties in the Scottish Parliament can obtain substantial funding and perform their parliamentary duties from the moment that the Scottish Parliament and the Executive assume full powers on 1 July.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order's structure provides for the Scottish parliamentary corporate body to make payments to qualifying political parties that will assist Members of the Scottish Parliament who are connected with such parties to perform their parliamentary duties. The cost of the scheme will be met from the Scottish Parliament's budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 1(2) defines a "qualifying party" as
	<br><blockquote><p>"a registered political party with which any member of the Parliament is connected."</p></blockquote>
Article 1(3) broadly defines a Member to be connected with a party if he or she was a candidate of that party at the time of an election. The scope of the provision includes a Member elected at a general election or a by-election, or taken from a party list to fill a mid-term vacancy for a regional seat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under article 2(1), the responsibility for making payments is vested in the Scottish parliamentary corporate body. From 1 July 1999, it will make payments to the parties for expenses incurred by them in the assitance of their Members' performance of their parliamentary duties. Article 2(2) provides that the maximum sum payable to any party in one period will be a relevant sum multiplied by the number of that party's Members of Parliament. Article 2(3) deals with the first, shortened, year of the Parliament, and provides that the maximum sum payable to a party between 1 July 1999 and 31 March 2000 will be £5,000 for each Member. It should be remembered that that sum covers a nine-month period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Articles 2(4) to 2(7) provide that, in future years, the relevant sum for each Member will be £5,000, subject to an annual increase in line with the retail price index. The Scottish Parliament may change the arrangements for the period after 1 July 1999.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 3 deals with parties represented in the Scottish Executive. Under section 97(2) of the Scotland Act 1998, parties in government will receive no share of the support, except in so far as is provided for under section 97(3). The article specifies the circumstances in which such parties will not be prevented from receiving a share of the support. Article 3(2) specifies that a party may receive support under the order, provided that its Members hold no more than one-fifth of the total number of Scottish Executive and junior ministerial posts. Article 3(3) further provides that Members of such a party who hold posts in the Executive at the beginning of any period—usually the previous April—will be disregarded when the maximum amount that the party may claim in that period is calculated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Teddy Taylor 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rochford and Southend, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that the Labour party will get nothing because its Members form the Executive, but that Members of the Liberal Democrat party will get money, even though they are part of the Administration? Is that not using public money to bribe a party to keep Labour in the Administration? That seems terrible, especially as it is against the principles of the Short money scheme, which was intended as an aid to Opposition parties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Clark</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for his intervention, but hope that he will bear in mind that we are considering new arrangements, which follow from the Neill committee report. I accept that the arrangements concerning Short money are different, but that does not matter. The principle of these arrangements has already been approved—it is covered by section 97 of the Scotland Act. The Neill committee considered that arrangements for the Scottish Parliament could be different. I direct the hon. Member's attention to paragraph 9.30 of that committee's report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Teddy Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Read it out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Clark</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Committe is aware of the differences which will exist between the forms that the devolved bodies take. It is also aware that the procedures of the UK Parliament—within which Short money operates—may well not be directly appropriate to them, especially the Northern Ireland Assembly, which is designed to have an Executive Committee drawn from all the parties in the Assembly. In all three bodies"—</p></blockquote>
including, of course, the Scottish Parliament with its Executive—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the political parties may well have functions related to the transaction of business, whether or not some of their members are part of the Executive. The considerations that led us not to favour the extension of Short money to Government backbenchers at Westminster may well not apply therefore. We would, on these grounds, support some sort of funding to political parties within the Scottish Parliament and the two Assemblies for the purpose of the better performance of their parliamentary or assembly functions."</p></blockquote>
What follows is critical:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It may be that the funding should be made available to all the parties, not just the minitority parites; it may also be that the funding should be made available to all the party groups as such, and not just spokesmen and spokeswomen. The detailed formulation must, we think, be a matter for the political parties within the individual assemblies."</p></blockquote>
It is fair to say that during discussion in the Neill committee and on section 97 of the Scotland Act, it was envisaged that the arrangements in the Scottish Parliament would be different from those at Westminster, for obvious reasons. It was not considered necessary or appropriate in the Scottish context to exclude some funding for parties such as the Liberal Democrats with a small number of Ministers on the Executive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alasdair Morgan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Galloway and Upper Nithsdale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can accept what the hon. and learned Lady is saying—that it is for the Scottish Parliament and the political parties there to come to an arrangement concerning their own Short money. But surely it is logical that if there is to be an interim
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
arrangement, it should continue with something similar to the existing Short money arrangements at Westminster. Why was it necessary to dream up a new scheme with a limited life, which the Minister admits is an interim measure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Lynda Clark</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised—or perhaps disappointed—at the hon. Gentleman's position. I thought that his party wanted a different arrangement. The Scottish Parliament is a different arrangement with a different voting system and more representatives per head of the population than at Westminster. As a result, the hon. Gentleman's party has greater representation in the Scottish Parliament than at Westminster.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas Alexander 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. and learned Friend agree that the essence of devolution is diversity and that the Short money would be an inadequate model to follow, even for an interim period, because the establishment of a coalition of the new politics and new institution has created completely different circumstances from those encountered by a single Executive at Westminster?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Clark</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I much appreciate my hon. Friend's intervention because he seems to understand the basis of the arrangement, which some hon. Members who have spoken do not. Perhaps that is my fault for not explaining properly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the essence of devolution is that decisions are taken by those to whom power is devolved. The decision in the order was taken by the Government at Westminster with no consultation with Opposition parties, unless there were backstairs conversations with the Liberal Democrats.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Clark</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman does not understand the timescale to which we are working. If the Government had done nothing and had spent weeks or months trying to consult with the hon. Gentleman, there would have been no interim measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 4 of the order deals with the handling of claims and audit arrangements and provides that a party must first make a claim before it may receive a payment. Parties must prove that they have actually incurred expenses before they receive support; the scheme does not simply provide each party with a cheque at the beginning of the year. Article 4(3) specifies that a claim for support must include a statement of the facts on which the claim is based and a certificate that the expense has been incurred exclusively for the purpose of assisting members with their parliamentary duties. Article 4(4) further provides that as soon as possible after the end of each period, any party seeking support under the scheme must provide the Clerk of the Parliament with the certificate of an independent professional auditor, confirming that the expenses were incurred for the correct purpose. The provision is not a blank cheque measure.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0612">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
Article 5 covers what happens when a general election occurs part of the way through a year, when specific measures apply to dividing up the year and dealing with the matter on a pro rata basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The total amount of support that will be available under the order for the last nine months of 1999–2000 is £340,000. The largest beneficiary will be the Scottish National party, which will be eligible to claim up to £175,000—if any hon. Members has difficulty with arithmetic, that is 35 times £5,000. The Conservative party, with 18 seats, will be eligible to claim up to £90,000 and the Liberal Democrats will be eliglible to claim up to £65,000. The Labour party will be eligible to claim nothing. The Green party and the Scottish Socialist party will also be able to claim up to £5,000 each.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the sake of completeness, perhaps the Minister could include in her figures the amount of money that is being spent on the Scottish Administration's special advisers, which I believe is in excess of £0.5 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Clark</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That has nothing to do with the question at issue. The whole point of trying to give funding to political parties is to assist them in their opposition duties. Funding through the civil service to the party of Government is a different matter altogether.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Letwin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a splendid occasion. We find ourselves debating an order that should not, ideally, be debated in this House. I believe that that is the almost universal view of the Committee. For the first ime, the order reveals to us the nature of the new consensus politics that pertains to the Scottish Parliament, where "consensus"—in Scots English, that is; I cannot speak for the Gaelic translation—apparently has an entirely different meaning from that which applies south of the border. One of my distinguished colleagues, Mr. McLetchie, who is the leader of the Conservative party in the Scottish Parliament, was a prime exponent of the art of consensus—as it is understood in Scotland, that is— when he described the matter that we are debating in the following terms:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The biggest scandal of all on this subject is the sleight of hand that will grant funding in this Parliament to the Liberal Democrats".</p></blockquote>
He went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Why is it necessary to rip the Scottish taxpayer off by another £85,000 … Are the Liberal Democrats not ashamed of themselves? Do they have no principles and integrity left? The Liberal Democrats in this Parliament are the boys from the folding stuff. It is not just gissa a job—it is gie us the money as well. If they have any self-respect, they should decline this pathetic bribe"—</p></blockquote>
I note the consensual language—
	<br><blockquote><p>"as even a Liberal lapdog cannot run with the hare and hunt with the hounds at the same time."</p></blockquote>
I shall spare the Committee the remainder of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
consensual debate that took place in the Scottish Parliament, and rest my case that consensus clearly has a different meaning in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the amusing aspect of the matter, but unfortunately there is also a serious aspect. In fact, there are many serious aspects, and my hon. Friends and I therefore intend to divide the Committee in due course. Although—notwithstanding last night's splendid election results—we do not anticipate winning the Division, it is important to put down a marker. I shall try to explain why that is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister lucidly explained some of the mechanics. When she responds to the debate, it would be helpful if she could clarify one of her remarks, which were otherwise absolutely clear. She said that the Labour party would get nothing. I had understood that the Labour party would lose the proportion of the amount to which it would otherwise be entitled that reflects £5,000 times the number of Members of the Executive and junior Ministers that it has. In that case, the Labour party would end up with something. I have clearly missed something: I am sure that the Minister is right and I am wrong, but I should like her to clarify the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While not wishing to echo the consensual terms that my more distinguished colleague in the Scottish Parlaiment used, the controversial matter that we are debating is whether the Liberal Democrats in the Scottish Parliament are in opposition or are part of the Government. No one would deny that if the Liberal Democrats were in opposition, they would deserve the money—whatever one's opinion of them and of their policies—or that if they were in government, they would not deserve it. According to the Minister's interpretation of the order, the Liberal Democrats would not receive this money if they were adjudged to be in government. This is an example of what one of my colleagues in the Scottish Parliament, Annabel Goldie, referred to, felicitously, as the obsequious ambivalence of the Liberal Democrats. I am astonished at the felicity of the terms chosen. The Liberal Democrats find themselves in an equivocal position in the Scottish Parliament, as they are for some purposes in opposition and for other purposes not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox) has drawn the attention of the House to a further consequence, which will recur in many guises and which we shall discuss for many years until it is finally resolved. That is the question of whether the Liberal Democrats—or, indeed, any other party that finds itself in this position—could be construed as being in opposition in this House, given that they are not in opposition in relation to Scottish affairs in another place where they form part of the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How, for example, could a Liberal Democrat spokesman at Scottish questions in the House of Commons conscientiously ask questions as though in opposition to the Government, when the governing party in this House is the same governing party with which they are in coalition in the Scottish Parliament?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon Gentleman accept that the Speaker has ruled that she is quite happy about how that system works in the House of Commons, which is elected to serve and function with its own particular arrangements, and that what happens in other tiers of government does not impinge on the working of the House?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I am aware that the Speaker has made such a ruling; I heard her do so. That ruling will govern us for the time being, because the Speaker is omniscient and, more to the point, omnipotent. However, the issue will not go away, and will be resolved only by means of extraordinary constitutional developments, with which the Government have not yet got to grips. I shall leave that matter to rest for the moment. We are dealing with the question of the Liberal Democrats' status in the Scottish Parliament, and of any money to which they might therefore be entitled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the view of the respresentative of the Scottish National party that it is odd that we should decide the matter here, now. It would be reasonable for us to do so if the order were like most of the others that we shall debate with the Minister in the next day or two, and that we have debated with her distinguished predecessor in the past few months. Many measures have been introduced as a result of genuine consensus, in which the various parties came together and made agreements. When my hon. Friends and I asked our colleagues north of the border whether they had any objections to those orders, we were repeatedly told that they not only had no objection, but that they had taken part in developing them. In those circumstances, it becomes merely a matter of artifice that, because of the dates of the implementation of the Act and the beginning of the Scottish Parliament, and the need to operate the Parliament, this House quite properly enacts orders that set the Scottish Parliament on the route that all Members of the Scottish Parliament have agreed is reasonable. However, this order is not like that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the hon. Gentleman have the seal of approval of his colleagues in the Scottish Parliament for the line that he took on every order relating to the Scottish Parliament that he debated?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman can rest assured that we have never said anything that we had not discussd with our colleagues north of the border.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not entirely clear as to the line of logic that the hon. Gentleman is advancing. He started his speech by mocking the nature of consensus in the new politics in Scotland, but then went on to complain that this order is not a product of consensus, and is therefore in error or faulty. Will he provide a clearer explanation as to why it is not appropriate for the Committee to approve an order that recognises that there is a new institution with wholly new procedures and a new set-up as regards the Executive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is my point. The matter has not been the subject of consensus; indeed, although everything is meant to be done by consensus, it was the subject of bitter dispute in the Scottish Parliament. It is, therefore, inappropriate for this Parliament to endow the Scottish Parliament with a necessarily highly controversial system for allocating money, which firmly identifies the Liberal Democrats—it happens to be them in this case—as the Opposition. That will set a highly regrettable precedent, which could be justified only if that were the universal view of Members of the Scottish Parliament, which it manifestly is not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not trying to anticipate the rest of the hon. Gentleman's remarks, but the logic of what he is arguing seems to be that no interim provisions should be made. Has he sought consensus with his Conservative colleagues north of the border on that point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Although it is in order to discuss major parts of the order, it is getting close to being out of order to discuss whether there was consensus or dispute in the Scottish Parliament on the issue before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be guided by that, Mr. Wells, and shall not discuss further the question of consensus—I have sufficiently established that there was none. What I want to say directly answers the intervention by the hon. Member for Paisley, South (Mr. Alexander). It would be vastly more appropriate for the provisions that obtain for Short money in this Parliament to be mirrored for the time being in the Scottish Parliament. In that way, it would be clear who was in opposition and that the Liberal Democrats were part of the Scottish Executive and, hence, of the Government. They would not merit Opposition moneys, although they would, of course, merit the support of special advisers and other perquisites that go with being in government. That would be perfectly proper. It would be natural for this Parliament to set the ball rolling in Scotland. It would then fall to the Scottish Parliament—it would hotly debate the matter—to decide what steps it wanted to take. It would be up to the Scottish Parliament to decide whether it wanted to take the steps that we are considering.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I presume that the hon. Gentleman accepts the Minister's point that the order is in order in terms of the Scotland Act, which the House approved and which he took considerable part in debating. Did he or his colleagues attempt to amend the part of the Bill that established that the order was perfectly correct procedure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right, by which I mean that I am morally convinced that he is right— I cannot in the least claim to have studied the interstices of the law sufficiently to know. However, given that the Minister is present, flanked by the great might of her Department, I am sure that the order, as a way of implementing the provisions of the Scotland Act, is perfectly in order. I am also sure that we would have suggested when we debated the Bill that none of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0614">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
us could have a clear idea of what would happen when the system of proportional representation, which we strongly opposed, was introduced into the elections for the Scottish Parliament. I am sure that we would also have said that it would leave open to question who the Government and the Opposition were. That is precisely what has come about, and this will not be the last time. The Liberal Democrats may not always be involved; indeed, it may in due course be the Conservative party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Teddy Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: God forbid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says, "God forbid" and I echo his remarks, God forbid that we should find ourselves in the dreadful position of being in a coalition Government—a form of government that I abhor more than any that man has invented, apart from tyranny. We might, however, find ourselves in that position, or somebody else might. My remarks are, therefore, not about the Liberal Democrats, but about the effect of taking principles that have been established in this Parliament, where—thank goodness—we generally do not have coalitions, and applying them to a Parliament that generally will have coalitions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the face of strongly debated differing views in the Scottish Parliament, this Parliament and this Government are imposing the order to make sure that the Government can be nice to their allies in that Parliament. Again, that raises the question of whether their allies in that Parliament are in opposition in this Parliament. We object to that on sound constitutional principles, which is why we shall vote against the order today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must press the hon. Gentleman on this point. He has recognised that the two Parliaments are different: as he has just said, the Westminster Parliament is disinclined towards consensus on the basis of coalition government, whereas the voting system for the Scottish Parliament makes that inherently more likely. If he accepts that the two Parliaments are different, why does he insist on his initial point that the same funding mechanism should be implemented, even on an interim basis?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, in my old age, I am becoming so subtle as to be invisible. In the badinage with which I began my remarks, I had intended to suggest that whatever is going on in the Scottish Parliament is—to put it bluntly—nothing like consensus. Whatever coalition government produces, it is not consensus. Consensus means the agreement of all, and that has not happened. It is only under those circumstances that I aver that this Parliament should adopt the principle of acting as it knows how to act, which is how hon. Members know how to act. The Scottish Parliament can decide later—perhaps in only a few months—how it wishes to organise its affairs. That will be decided by majority voting and not—far from it— by consensus alone. That would be a fine resolution, which we hope to achieve by voting against the order.
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
I am not wholly optimistic that we will succeed in defeating it, but it would be better if we were able to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to speak on this matter—I had thought that we would rubber stamp what the Scottish Parliament had set in train—but I must respond to some of the comments made in this Committee. The hon. Member for Rochford and Southend, East (Sir Teddy Taylor) used the word "bribe" in relation to the arrangement proposed by the First Minister of the Scottish Parliament. That is offensive, and it must be challenged. The strangest intervention was made by the hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Morgan), who said that the unionist Parliament should make decisions relating to money for parties in the Scottish Parliament. If the measure has been challenged from those two angles, there must be something fundamentally correct in it. I therefore felt that I should speak in its support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alasdair Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the decision is being made by the unionist Parliament? It was the nature of the decision that I challenged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The 	<i>Hansard</i> record will show that what the hon. Gentleman challenged was the fact that the recommendation had been sent for approval from the Scottish Parliament to this Parliament. If he checks his own words, he will find that he made the wrong point, and not the one that he has just made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was angry to hear the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin)—who was quoting, I think, from someone else—use the word "rip-off". Unfortunately, much of the debate about the Scottish Parliament's housekeeping arrangements has been conducted in that tone. The Scottish people wanted their own Parliament, but the press and Opposition have denigrated it constantly, just as they have denigrated every advance under this Government in the past two years, because they dislike successful responses to the democratic will.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the proposed arrangements, the SNP will get £175,000 the Conservatives £90,000 and the Liberal Democrats £65,000. Although that is an interim arrangement—which Labour Members will support and which I will support—I am disappointed that it has not gone far enough. Article 3(3) recognises that some coalition party Members will be Ministers, and will therefore be supported by advisers, whom the hon. member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale attacked again. Back-Bench coalition party Members should also be treated as a party, as should Back-Bench Members of the main Government party, to whom consideration should perhaps have been given. In this House, Short money has always been allocated only to the Opposition, to the exclusion of the Government party, but that creates a Government party monolith because all of the money goes to Government Departments and Ministers. As a Back-Bench Member of seven years, I recognise that, even in this
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0615">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
Parliament, Back-Bench Members, even of the Government party, have a different role, which is not appreciated. When the Scottish Parliament makes its final decision, if it makes nay change to the provisions, I hope that it will consider applying that logic to every party. Article 3(3) states that Ministers or junior Ministers will be excluded from any calculation, but that parties will be allocated funds according to the remaining number of Back Benchers. That reflects what the Scottish people really want. They do not want monolithic government by arrangement, with one party forming the Government and having its Back Benchers taken out of the funding equation. An opportunity is being missed here for the Scottish Parliament to treat parties and Back Benchers in a correct manner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Eleanor Laing 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Epping Forest)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How can the hon. Gentleman claim to argue in favour of the will of the Scottish people when it was clearly not the will of the Scottish people that the Liberal Democrat party should form part of the Government, because fewer people voted for them and their manifesto than for anyone else?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That illustrates that, having been away from Scotland for so long, the hon. Lady has not followed the debate for the previous decade. The parties to the Scottish constitutional convention, which was the bedrock from which the Parliament was proposed to the people, were the Labour party and the Liberal Democrat party, with the support of many others in civic society. Many people voted for the Liberal Democrat party on the basis that they hoped that it would form part of a coalition. That was clear, because the Conservatives argued, "Vote for the Liberals, you get the Labour party." That was part of the Conservatives' sloganising.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 3(3) recognises that those in a party who are Ministers and who act within a ministerial remit receive support, but other Members within that party who remain outside should be recognised and funded through what has become known in this Parliament as Short money. I support that proposal, because it has been made by the First Minister, and we are here—I hope—to support him in his work during the interim. However, I hope that when the Scottish Parliament returns to consider how to allocate public funds to parties, it will genuinely consider whether those who are not members of the Government—who are not Ministers—should not also be supported, in the same way that members of what we may call the present junior member of the alliance in Scotland will be supported under the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.7 pm</p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Several issues have been raised. I should like to follow up the last remark of the hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty), because Members of the Scottish Parliament may choose to read what is said here, even if they choose to dismiss much of it and reinvent the wheel when they get the chance. They should seriously consider the hon. Gentleman's proposal for the funding of Back Benchers of all parties. As the Neill committee recognised, when there is a tendency towards coalition government, as there is in many other countries, support for Back Benchers of the respective coalition parties is necessary for democracy to work, so that those who voted for those parties continue to have their voice heard in order to influence and control the Executive in an accountable manner outside ministerial office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scotland Act also recognised in a Government amendment that coalition was a possible outcome. As the hon. Member for West Dorset said, that provision was not amended, nor was an attempt made to amend it, during the passage of the Act. The order is thus a nutural outcome of the Act. I should like to correct something that the hon. Member for Falkirk, East said. As far as I can recall, during the Conservatives' campaign, they were adamant and emphatic that if people voted Liberal Democrat they would end up with an SNP Government in Scotland, so I do not know that their powers of prophecy and prediction are that great.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To the hon. Gentleman's last remark, I would say hallelujah. However, I am puzzled by his phrase that the order is the "natural outcome" of section 97(2) of the Scotland Act. Surely the purpose of article 3(1) is precisely to override the clear intent of section 97(2).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The section actually gives the power so to do, and a power to override something is not included in an Act unless the need to do so is foreseen. The point was made in debate in the House of Lords at the time that a junior partner to a coalition might need to have its voice heard and require funding to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As you, Mr. Wells, have ruled, we should not be debating the consensus or otherwise of the Scottish Parliament; that is for the Scottish Parliament to sort out, and for the electorate to judge in four years' time. It is, however, a pity that the order and a few other measures that we have debated were not established before the elections; it is far better to established such matters in detail when there are no political consequences for people to be concerned about. I read in the 	<i>Hansard</i> of the Scottish Parliament a claim that the order was actually drafted before the election— perhaps the Minister will confirm at what point its technical wording was written.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also essential for this House to recognise that the order is an interim arrangement and that from 1 July, it will be open to the Scottish Parliament to do whatever it wants—the order merely establishes some kind of working arrangements until then. As we know, we cannot amend regulations in this place; if we pass
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0616">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
the measure now, it is up and running. The Scottish Parliament can then work out what it wants to do. With hindsight, however, I am surprised that such a provision was not included in the Scottish Parliament's shadow arrangements. Other aspects of how that Parliament should be arranged had been discussed, but I suppose that this little detail was in the wrong part of the Scotland Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.10 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Teddy Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall just say a few words. I was very depressed to hear my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset say that we did not have a chance of rejecting the order. I genuinely hope that as Labour Members listen to the debate, they will realise that there is something very wrong with the order and that they should reject it—basically, they should tell the Whips to go and jump, as I have had the pleasure of doing from time to time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that he is one of the very few Members of this House who ever does that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Teddy Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I very rarely do it, and only as a matter of principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I not trying to make a party-political point, but we should have nothing to do with the order. I am sure that, had my party been in power, they might well have done the same in similar circumstances and thus been equally guilty and shameful, but we all know—there is no point in hiding it—that this is a fiddle using public money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What matters about yesterday's European election results—which I cannot discuss in detail, or you, Mr. Wells, will hammer me down—is not that the Tories did well or whether Labour or anyone else did well, but the fact that the public are going on strike. About 75 per cent. of people are sick to death of politics. Some people in Southend said to me, "Why would I vote for that stupid European Parliament when I hear about all the fiddles they do with their expenses?" People are sick to death of it. Even in relation to the Short money for which the order provides, although I can see the logic of saying, "The Government have a whole pile of advisers and civil servants; why shouldn't the Opposition parties have something?", frankly, we have gone so far that the public are switching off from politics and saying that we are all a crowd of rascals and they want nothing to do with us. By passing the order, we will be saying that because the Liberal Democrats, through a number of unfortunate accidents, have cut a deal with the Government in the Scottish Parliament, we must do something for them and wouldn't it be unfair if we did not?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we are using public money, we should abide by the basic principle that those who are in government do not get help because they have civil servants and special advisers, while whose who are in opposition do. If we want to break with that principle, why on earth are we doing it in anticipation of the Scottish Parliament? It is only a few months away from making
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
its own decisions—if it says that its circumstances are special, it can act accordingly. However, if this system is in place for a few months, we know what will happen. When the Scottish Parliament debates the issue, the Government will say, "We might have taken a different point of view, but this system has undermined our freedom of action because if we change it, it would mean that our friends, the Liberal Democrats, who are getting money now, will not get money in the future". If we think that circumstances are different there, let us leave the issue to the Scottish Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One may argue that people might lose money—the Conservatives, the SNP and the Liberal Democrats might all lose money. So what? If the Scottish Parliament says that money is being lost, it could incarease the amount by 10 per cent., or something like that, it it felt that it was worth it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members know that I have never been a great supporter of the Scottish Parliament, although I wish it well and pray for its success now that it has happened. However, we must face up to the issue. The hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir Robert Smith), who I am sure is hard working, sincere and kind to children and dogs, asked why all parties and Back Benchers should not receive money. He should realise that the powers of Parliament are bleeding away, as you, Mr. Wells, know because you are, unfortunately, almost as old as I am. We are getting more allowances, but there is precious little to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be a concern for the Conservatives, who will get only £3.3 million towards their Short money, but if we were having this debate in the Scottish Parliament, the Minister would not be present because Ministers will not be members of permanent Committees, which will be able to hold the Executive to account and to initiate legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I would not encourage the hon. Member to respond to that intervention. It was clearly out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Teddy Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You are quite right, Mr. Wells. It is sad that when I raise a straightforward issue, the hon. Gentleman talks about something that is out of order. I do not want to get diverted on to silly matters, although you and I are used to such tactics, Mr. Wells.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People should accept that the Scottish Parliement can make its own decisions. If it wants to give lots of money in lots of different ways, that is its business because it is answerable to the people of Scotland. If the people of Scotland get sick to death of it, they may go on strike or vote for a new party that might suddenly emerge. Although we are not supposed to mention this, the European Parliament elections gave rise yesterday to a new party, which arose from nothing. It seems to be doing very well, not necessarily because of its policies but because people are sick to death with what is going on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should be careful with public money. We must not waste it by doing deals with other parties to which we say, "We will give you this if you do that". What we are doing is shameful. I genuinely hope that those
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0617">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
Labour Members who are good, honourable and sincere—[HON. MEMBERS: "Name them."] I can think of one I would not name. We should have the courage to say that we are chucking out this order. We should allow the Scottish Parliament to make its decision and be answerable to the electorate. All we are doing is engaging in a fiddle with public money. We should have nothing to do with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.16 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alasdair Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I should like to address the lack of consultation on the content of the order. The Neill committee report, which has been alluded to, included the recommendation that the parties of the Scottish Parliament should agree the arrangements for Short money. We know that there has been no consultation with the Scottish National party, the Conservative party or the minority parties, the Scottish Green party and the Scottish Socialist party. I am not sure whether the Liberal Democrat party in Scotland was consulted—perhaps we will be enlightened on that—but there has been a total lack of consultation with the major Opposition party in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Falkirk, East said that the arrangement had been sent from the Scottish Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not mind the hon. Gentleman forgetting what he said, but he should try to remember what I said. I said that the arrangement was sent by the First Minister of the Scottish Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman checks the record, he will see that on two occasions he said that it had been sent by the First Minister. However, in between those statements, he said that it had been sent by the Scottish Parliament—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] Two out of three is up to scratch. Let us be clear for the record: nothing in the order has been sent by the Scottish Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the amounts involved, I am not convinced by the formula, with which I would quibble. The formula for Short money is designed to address the shortcomings of the first-past-the-post system in which seats do not necessarily reflect the votes that parties receive. I presume that the Government have included a flat-rate formula in the order because the Scottish Parliament is elected on a proportional basis, but that is not true. Although there was an element of proportionality in the election, there was an element of unfairness in the number of seats that some parties received. For example, the Labour party in the Scottish Parliament has 43 per cent. of the seats, even though it received—I think—39 and 31 per cent. in the two votes. Any proposed formula should include the second element of an amount of money per 200 votes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a former teacher of mathematices, I was able to work out that the Scottish National party will receive £175,000, although one does not need a calculator to work out such a sum, which approximates the office costs allowance for four Members. Given that the Government have the full force of their special
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
advisers and the civil service at their disposal, that is a derisory level of funding for the activities of the official Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Westminster, Short money is only part of the funding for Opposition parties; the office of Leader of the Opposition is funded substantially from public funds. Apparently, there is no need for an interim arrangement in the Scottish Parliament, which is deemed to be capable of handling the matter quite happily on 1 July. What logic is there in saying that the Scottish Parliament can reach a decision on that, and that the Leader of the Opposition need not be funded until 1 July, but that this order must be rushed through in case the Scottish Parliament cannot reach a decision on the Short money?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like the money received by all Opposition parties in the Scottish Parliament to be calculated on the basis of consultation involving all parties in the Scottish Parliament; then we could reach a sensible conclusion, rather than submit to the diktat of the Administration in the Scottish Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way again—I gave him another opportunity to answer a direct question. We expect further negotiations on those issues and I am sure that the SNP has considered its point of view. During those negotiations, what sum will the SNP ask for from the public purse, and from where should it come?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale pursues that intervention, I should point out that the question is not entirely in order. The part relating to the amount of money that will be allocated to the SNP within the Scottish Parliament is in order, but the rest is clearly out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not quite sure whether I am therefore allowed to reveal my negotiating hand. [HON. MEMBERS: "GO on."] I shall resist the temptation to reveal any negotiating hand in advance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I shall move on to the issue of the date. The Minister said that, if the order that will be discussed tomorrow were accepted, the Scottish Parliament would be empowered to make its own arrangements in less than a month's time—on 1 July. Given that the order before us will take effect only from 1 July, I wonder whether it is worth the candle. Why do the Government feel that they must make this arrangement now, rather than allowing the Scottish Parliament to make it in a few days' time? The Scottish

	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
Parliament is supposed to begin its recess on 2 July, but we could give up a few days' holiday to deal with the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Laing</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a point of clarification, the hon. Member for Falkirk, East said that I have been away from Scotland for a while; in fact, I have been away for only a few days. I did not realise that, after all this fuss, the Scottish Parliament is to start sitting properly on 1 July and adjourn on 2 July. Is that really true?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order, The Lady's intervention is out of order. The order covers the allocation of money to registered political parties in the Scottish Parliament and I should be grateful if the Committee would keep that clearly in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has said that the sum under discussion in the Committee is derisory and that the contemplated allocation of money is not worth the candle. Does that reflect the views of his party on the use of taxpayers' money? Does his party believe that the sum of £175,000 is not worth the candle and is derisory? His constituents might think it curious that the use of their funds is considered derisory when it is a significant sum of money. Further, does the hon. Gentleman accept that the work of Opposition parties, for which he has made a case today, continues throughout the political year?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Labour Administration have developed an interesting habit: they seem to think that it is bad if money from the public purse is spent on anything other than what the Government want to spend money on. If it is spent on a Government project, there is no problem; if it is spent by Opposition parties, the Government think it is a waste of public money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equating the funding of the main Opposition party in Scotland with the funding of four hon. Members' offices in this place is derisory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman recognise that, although we all want effective democracy, it is disappointing that discussion is always reduced to debate such as this when it comes to funding that democracy?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Short money available to the Scottish nationalists in this place is £134,000 for the current year, so at least there will be more than that when it comes to setting the baseline in future Scottish Parliament discussions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should not mix up the funding of the Opposition groups in the two Houses, but I accept the hon. Gentleman's view that it is unfortunate that we must have such discussions in the Committee. The Neill committee was against that. The matter should have been decided by consensus among parties before the order came before the House. That is the substantial point. We should not have to argue about the details of funding for Opposition parties. There
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
should be some consensus, and we should have been asked about the matter, even if the Government decided at the end of the day to introduce something totally at variance with what the other parties wanted. At least they wuld have been consulted; but the matter was never even floated past the Opposition parties in the Scottish Parliament or in this place. That is a disgrace and goes against everything in the report of the Neill committee and, most important, against the spirit of that report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are not setting up an interim arrangement for the next nine months; they are clearly attempting to set up a permanent arrangement. That is why there are so many complexities in the order in repect of what will happen at the end of nine months and how the arrangement can be carried forward. The Government do not intend it to be revised within the next nine months. They are trying to put in place a permanent arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the Liberal Democrat arrangement and the curious circumlocution in the order to explain how many members of the Government an Opposition party must have before it qualifies as an Opposition party. I am not against a party that is part of a coalition receiving funding from Short money, but that should have been part of the consultation exercise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have ignored the recommendations of the Neill committee. We have ignored the needs of the Leader of the Opposition in the Scottish Parliament. We have not followed the recommendation of the Neill committee that Short money should be sufficient to enable parties to perform their functions adequately. The Government must explain whether they are willing to pay enough money to allow Opposition parties to perform their functions adequately. If they are willing to allow that money, it will be a charge on the public purse. I suspect that they want that charge on the public purse to be zero.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order leaves a bad taste in the mouth. It was not brought up before the Scottish parliamentary election, because Labour Members did not know what the results of that election would be. The reason that the arrangements have been introduced after the election is because they did not like the result, and they certainly do not want a well-funded, articulate Opposition in Holyrood. I hope that the Scottish Parliament will move quickly to review these arrangements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.29 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Lynda Clark</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate has been lively, if not always well informed. I am worried at the attitudes displayed by some hon. Members. I suspect that they propose to vote against the order only because they are confident that the Labour party and other Members will ensure that it goes through. If they thought that their voting against the order would deprive their parties in the Scottish Parliament of substantial funding, I would be surprised if they would do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal with the main points that have been raised. First, there is the question of timing. Hon. Members will be aware of the great pressure on parliamentary time. It was open to the Government to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0619">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
do nothing other than what they proposed to do tomorrow, that is, to give legislative competence to the Scottish Parliament. That would have fulfilled the Government's commitments to the Neill principles in relation to this issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the Government decided that that would be unfair, because they realise that it may take a little time for the Scottish Parliament to bed down, and to decide in the light of experience what arrangements should be made for these matters. Rather than leave the Scottish Parliament and the parties with no funding of the type under discussion, the Government decided to do their best to introduce the order, despite the pressures of parliamentary time. The order had to be laid before the end of May, and has to be debated here and in another place, if it is to be approved by the Privy Council on 22 June and to come into force on 1 July. Because of technical procedures governing the order, any delay in the parliamentary timetable would not necessarily have been of a few days or even weeks. After 1 July, the procedures for making a section 97 order will change. Laying the order later than the end of May would have carried the risk that no scheme could have been brough into force before the autumn. The Government would then have lost the opportunity to make funds available from 1 July.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal with the intemperate remarks made about starving the Opposition, and the pretence that the substantial sums to be made available on an interim basis will not be worth having. I am surpised that Opposition Members should think that. There seems to be a new-found enthusiasm for Westminster among some of them. I should like to place on record that, giving evidence to the Neill committee last June, a representative of the Scottish National party who is now a Member of the Scottish Parliament, Mr. Russell, specifically declined to express satisfaction with the Short arrangements at Westminster. What he wanted, on behalf of the SNP, was
	<br><blockquote><p>"an allocation that favours the duty of opposition parties, rather than simply the numbers."</p></blockquote>
So little was Short money felt to provide the right model, that Opposition party funding would, he said,
	<br><blockquote><p>"clearly be called something else"</p></blockquote>
in the Scottish Parliament. But, it would seem, not something all that different after all. It is not possible to pick and mix at Westminster. We are now told that anything less than £10,000 per Member for the parties in the Scottish Parliament would represent starvation funding and stifling of the Opposition. That is nonsense, and apparently based on the levels of support agreed in this place as appropriate under the Westminster voting system for Opposition parties shadowing the Government in the Westminster context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hardly need tell hon. Members that the role of the Opposition in Westminster is not the same as the arrangements that have been made in the Scottish Parliament. If we take into account the fact that the £5,000 proposed is for a nine-month period, we are talking about the difference between approximately £7,500 and £10,000 over a year. How can it be said that such a relatively small difference is not worth having,
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
but that there is a starvation of funds? It must be remembered that the Westminster Short money formula goes hand in hand with the Westminster voting system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alasdair Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My mathematics must be failing me. Will the Minister explain her remarks about the nine months of the year? I shall pay close attention this time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Clark</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, the £5,000 is over nine months, but it was intended to be—and will be in the future—over a year. These interim arrangements mean that, for a short time, there is an advantage—the figure goes up—because that £5,000 is spread over nine months, instead of 12. I do not take full responsibility for the actual arithmetic, but that is the theory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to the money that is to be given to Opposition parties under the order, they will also receive Short money under the newly enhanced arrangements that have just been approved at Westminster—some Members of Parliament sit in both Westminster and the Scottish Parliament. One must also take into account the new arrangements that have been proposed for the funding of Members of the Scottish Parliament generally. In any future allocation of resources, all these aspects of the matter must be taken into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Clark</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have given way to the hon. Gentleman several times, but I want to make progress now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Scottish Parliament will, in due course, take into account all the relevant arrangements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and learned Friend was mild in the way she passed over one of the most blatant issues. Questions have been asked—certainly in my constituency—about the allocation of £46,000 to each member of the SNP who is on the list but does not have constituents to represent. No one can tell me that that money will not be used to add to the Short money and do party political work on the SNP's behalf.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Clark</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall leave that matter to the Scottish Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must bear in mind the fact that the arrangements at Westminster are different from those in Scotland. Obviously, there is a different voting system in Scotland, which produced a higher number of Members per head of population in the Scottish Parliament. That explains why the various Opposition parties have many more representatives—indeed, the Conservative party now has representatives in the Scottish Parliament. Furthermore, the Scottish Parliament will operate in a different way. A different role is envisaged for the Committees and the support that will be available to Members through those Committees may be substantial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also a duty on the Government to have regard to the public interest—the public will want to know why public funds are spent in a certain way; at the end of the day, the expenditure must be justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0620">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
There has been some criticism of the position of the Liberal Democrats. In the spirit of consensus, I shall say a few words in support of that position. As I said, the Neill committee envisaged—as did arrangements made under the Scotland Act 1998—that it would be possible for another party to be in coalition in the Executive and that, if that were the case, different arrangements would be necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked when the order was drafted. I do not have the details, because I was not involved in the drafting, but I understand that it was substantially drafted before the election; I do not know whether that is of any help to anyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps it would also be heldful if I tried to answer the specific question of the hon. Member for West Dorset regarding interpretation. As he will appreciate, it is always difficult to interpret on the hoof, so to speak, but my understanding is that one has to read section 97 of the Scotland Act 1998 along with article 3 of the order. Section 97(2) of the Scotland Act states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The corporation shall not make any payment to a party in pursuance of such an Order if any of the members of the Parliament who are connected with the party are also members of the Scottish Executive or junior Scottish Ministers."</p></blockquote>
That would, on the face of it, rule out all the Members. However, it must be read in conjunction with subsection (3), which provides that
	<br><blockquote><p>"an Order may, in any circumstances specified in the Order, require the fact that any members who are connected with a party are also members of the Scottish Executive or junior Scottish Ministers to be disregarded."</p></blockquote>
Under the order, in general terms, the provisions of section 97(2) of the Act apply—in other words, members of the Executive are not included. The issue is that of payments to a party. Section 97(2) prohibits payments to a party in circumstances in which the Members are members of the Executive. At the moment, the primary members of the Executive are Labour Members, and my understanding is that, under the present arrangements, the order will result in no payment to Labour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is worth clarifying this matter, so as to avoid problems arising under Pepper v. Hart. My difficulty may be due to infelicitous drafting or a typographical error. Article 3(2) of the order qualifies the effect of section 97(2) of the Act through the exercise, in effect, of the Henry VII provision that is permitted by section 97(2). I have no difficulty with that from a legislative point of view. Article 3(3) appears to refer back to article 2(2). Because article 3(2) clearly qualifies section 97(2) of the Act, I take the natural interpretation of the statutory construction to be that article 3(3) also qualifies section 97(2) of the Act, and that article 3(3) makes article 2(2) operate on the governing party as well, but with the subtraction from the number to be multiplied by £5,000 of those Members who are members of the Executive or junior Ministers. I am sure that that is not the intent, but I am not sure how the drafting reflects that. It would be helpful if the Minister would clarify the matter. She should also put on the record absolutely clearly—not merely as a matter of interpretation, but so as to state
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
the Government's intent clearly for Pepper v. Hart purposes—that the governing party at any point in time is not to receive any money under the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Clark</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Trying to give an opinion on the hoof is not very satisfactory. If the hon. Gentleman had wished me to write to him about the matter, I would have done so. So far as intention is concerned, I am happy to confirm that it is not intended that the existing Labour party, under the present arrangements, would receive funds under the order. Having said that, if the Executive were to change, the matter would be open for further consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With that technical matter out of the way, I should like to conclude by saying that the Government value an effective and well-supported Opposition. The recent review of Short money in the House of Commons showed how important we regard an effective Opposition to be. We are making sure that from 1 July the Scottish Parliament will have powers to make whatever provision it considers justified in the light of experience. That is the right and constructive way to tackle this important issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the present, we are merely asking the House to approve a transitional scheme that will get the parties off to a fair start, and represents a reasonable call on the Scottish Parliament's budget. It makes a total of approximately £340,000 available to registered parties in the Parliament between 1 July this year and 31 March 2000—on no view, is that insignificant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be for the Scottish Parliament to decide in the light of experience whether the total amount and its allocation are right and to justify its decisions to the electorate. We have tried to co-operate with the recommendations of the Neill committee on that point, and I submit that we have succeeded. For those reasons, I hope that the Committee will accept the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Wells. Perhaps it would be appropriate if I remedied an unintentional rudeness that I committed at the beginning of the debate: I welcome the Minister on her first appearence on the Front Bench.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
