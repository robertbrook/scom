	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Steve Webb	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Northavon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Income Support (General) (Standard Interest Rate Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 1998. (S.I., 1998, No. 2878)</p></blockquote>
It may seem rather odd for us to be debating a statutory instrument that will give additional help to unemployed home buyers, given that we heartily support such a measure. The Minister could be forgiven for wondering why we chose to debate such an instrument. Had we thought about it 18 months ago, we would have probably done it then. However, today's sitting gives us the opportunity to question how the Government support unemployed and low-income home buyers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now seems an apposite time to have such a debate for two reasons. First, the Government inherited a system of support for unemployed home buyers that was inadequate in many respects and it was reasonable to assume that they would want some time to think about it. After 18 months, however, I am sure that the Government have now thought about the system. I hope that the Minister will advise us of the Government's present thinking and tell us how they plan to reform the wholly incompetent system that is reflected in the statutory instrument as it was in the general policy of the previous Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second reason why such a debate is timely is that, notwithstanding today's unemployment figures, it is not unreasonable to suppose that over the next year or so as the economy slows—if not goes into a recession—unemployment may rise. We are concerned that the tragedy of job loss does not convert into the tragedy of home loss for many unemployed home buyers. We want to be reassured that, as unemployment rises—albeit only gently—the Government are in a position to support unemployed home buyers in a more effective way than the system reflected in the regulation would enable them to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be grateful for the Minister's comments on three issues in relation to mortgage support for unemployed and low-paid home buyers. I refer first to how the interest rate used to calculate the rate of support for unemployed home buyers is calculated and the basis on which the rate used in the regulation has been calculated. There are various problems, as the hon. Lady will be aware, the average rate that is used is not an average of all mortgage lenders, but an average of building societies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
Consequently, the rates charged by the Halifax bank or the Alliance and Leicester bank have no impact on the rate of interest that unemployed home buyers are given, but the rate charged by mortgage giants, such as the Cheshire building society, the Coventry building society, the Cumberland building society, the Derbyshire building society, the Dunfermline building society, the Furness building society, the Lambeth building society—and my favourite—the Leek United building society, influence the amount of support that is given. I note from a written answer in 	<i>Hansard</i> that also included on the list of major giants is the Britannia building society—not a society that specialises in low-income borrowers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, it is an anachronism that building society rates are used. There can be no justification for that; the world has moved on from the time when everyone had a mortgage with a building society. I ask the Minister to concede that simple point so that in future regulations, the average rate used is that weighted by all the lenders, not just small societies that are mainly irrelevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second problem with the interest rate that is reflected in the regulations is that it is completely out of date. This month, interest rates have been cut substantially, yet we are debating a regulation that will increase the rate of interest paid by unemployed home buyers to 8.65 per cent., when many people taking out a new mortgage or an existing variable rate mortgage are paying 7.5 per cent. At present, that is obviously to their benefit; it will give them extra money, but for the whole of the Parliament, until last month, the converse was true. Until last December, the standard interest rate under regulations such as we are discussing was below the average interest rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Goverment said that they did not have the information, so I asked the Library to calculate how much that shortfall has added to the mortgage debt of unemployed home buyers and it put the figure at £75 million. Why should a Government want to add £75 millon to the mortgage debt of people who are already in a difficult situation, simply because of the bizarre and arcane method of calculating their interest? There must be a better way of doing things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be argued that the anomalies are evened out over the cycle; sometimes the interest rate reacts too slowly and insufficient support is given, sometimes too much support is given, as in the regulations. However, people's personal finances do not necessarily survive the economic cycle. If someone becomes unemployed and finds a job 18 months later, he or she would have received insufficient mortgage support for the whole period of unemployment. Obviously, if interest rates were falling, the reverse would be true. When people become unemployed, it is a lottery whether interest rates are rising or falling and it is unfair to say to them, "Well, if you hold on for long enough, you will get extra money"—in the meantime their home may have been repossessed. It is not good enough to say that the situation evens itself out. We should be paying people the right amount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0153">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
My final point on the way in which the interest rate is calculated is that using a single figure fails to cater for the range of people's mortgage circumstances. I recently remortgaged my property and was faced with a choice of more than 500 mortgage offers. Having a simple, single interest rate obvously has administrative attractions, but some people on low incomes have mortgages with their local authority at interest rates much higher than typical figures, whereas others, who have been fortunate enough to take advantage of new, low fixed rates, enjoy rates well below those. Why should the public purse overfund those who benefited from good rates and grotesquely underfund those who are paying penal interest rates? Surely payments should adjust quickly, take account of true lending patterns and give the right amount of interest. That would not make much difference to the Exchequer over the cycle, but would make a big difference to individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My first objection to such regulations is based on the way in which the interest rate is calculated. Such differences are not minor; during the Government's term of office, the interest rate set down in regulations has at times been a full 1 per cent. standard rate short of the true interest rate—a shortfall that could amount to £30 or £40 a month on a typical mortgage. The amount involved is sometimes a lot less, but still adds to the mortgage debt of the unemployed and I am sure that the Minister does not want to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked the Library another question: what has the Government's continuation of the previous Government's policy cost unemployed home buyers? It told me that a cumulative £45 million has been added to the mortgage debt of unemployed people since the Government came to office. I tried to get that information from written questions to the Department, but I was told that it does not know the answer. Why does it not know the answer? Why has it not calculated that figure, and why has it not conducted research to establish the scale of the problem? I hope that the Minister will tell me that the Department has conducted research into the variety of interest rates paid by unemployed people with mortgages and that, as a result, its policy will change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second objection to the system of mortgage support inherited from the previous Government is that when people who took out a mortgage after October 1995 lose their jobs, they do not get the interest rate specified in the regulations—for nine months, they get 0 per cent. If people do not have much in the way of savings, the Government support that they receive after nine months could come too late; their house could be on the brink of repossession. I hope that the Minister will tell us that the Government have looked at that problem and will address it by ensuring that mortgage support is given sooner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The previous Government said that it does not matter that people get no help for nine months because they can rely on the private insurance market. However, private mortgage insurance is terribly patchy; coverage is still low and even though some companies give it away as a deal with new mortgages, not many people retain it once the free period is over.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
Many people either cannot or find it difficult to get private mortgage insurance: self-employed and disabled people, for example. The private market is not interested in such people and the state is the only body that can cover them. I therefore again ask the Minister to tell us how the Government are to fill that nine-month gaping hole. I have not looked up to see whether Labour voted against the cuts in mortgage support that were introduced in October 1995, but I think that I could make a good guess as to the answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point is on mortgage support for those in low-paid jobs. The regulations will support someone working up to 16 hours a week, but the second that they work more than that all the support disappears. Someone could be receiving £400 a month of mortgage support; the DSS's own research has shown that the loss of help with housing costs and mortgages is one of the principal barriers to moving off income support. The Government could have addressed that, through such measures as the working families tax credit, but have failed to do so. As well as telling us what the Government will do for unemployed home buyers, I hope that the Minister will set out a strategy for low-paid home buyers so that the help that people receive when they are unemployed is not suddenly taken away if they take a low-paid job. Liberal Democrats would like a system that matches actual mortgage interest costs, which would cost a little more than the present system, but the additional cost would not amount to a great deal more over the cycle and would ensure that people did not build up arrears at a time when life is particularly difficult for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government have thought hard about this issue and that the Minister will tell us what they have concluded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.40 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Angela Eagle)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I wish to congratulate you, Mr. Malins, on chairing your first Committee. No doubt you have begun your career as a Committee chairman as you intend to continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb) may regret raising this matter on the very day that unemployment figures went down. He is praying against a regulation that will give additional help with mortgage payments to unemployed people on income support or jobseeker's allowance. The most recent rise in interest rates has now worked its way through the system. I hope that I can reassure him about some of the matters that he raised, especially with regard to the time lag and the calculation of the standard interest rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to spend a little time examining why the standard interest rate came into being. The hon. Gentleman may not remember that the previous Government introduced it in 1995 to deal with an extremely complicated situation. The system of paying actual interest rates led to a vast number of extra calculations and complicated administrative problems for the Benefits Agency. Changes in interest rates were not uniform and the Benefits Agency was tracking not 500 rates, but nearly 1,000. We have now identified
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0154">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
3,000 different interest rates to be tracked and applied to individual cases. The Benefits Agency was not informed of changing interest rates, so overpayments and underpayments were made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Public Accounts Committee and the Social Security Advisory Committee produced critical reports saying that the system was out of control and unmanageable. It was therefore replaced with the standard interest rate. As a result of that change, accuracy has improved by 15 per cent. That makes it faster and easier to deliver help with mortgage interest to the unemployed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two choices in this area of policy. We can go back to the old system, which will be made more complicated by the existence of more lenders and 3,000 different interest rates, or we can have an average rate, which can be paid simply, efficiently and quickly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Webb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Am I right to infer from the Minister's defence of the standard interest rate that she and her party supported the changes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We recognise that the changes had many administrative merits. We certainly support the retention of averaging—the standard interest rate—in the payment of benefit, as we have all experienced the system that existed until 1995, since when lending and financial markets have become even more complicated. Having considered the issue, we must choose one or other of those approaches; an average interest rate approach seems to the Government to be the most sensible way of dealing with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also raised the issue of what is often referred to as a consolidated rate. He rightly pointed out that, when introduced, the standard interest rate was based explicitly on the Office for National Statistics 	<i>Financial Statistics</i> table 7.1L, which is included in the legislation—a very precise example of primary legislation for our consideration. It was agreed that the standard rate would be
	<br><blockquote><p>"at, or around, the average rate of interest".</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman rightly pointed out that since that decision was made, on the basis of building society rates, a change has taken place in the financial lending market—the demutualisation of many building societies. The matter is under constant review. The hon. Gentleman was rather insulting to the Leek United building society, which no doubt performs a valuable service to the people who place their trust and money in it. Despite demutualisation, 20 per cent. of the current volume of lending is still encompassed in building societies. We must keep an eye on and shall continue to review the matter, but I am afraid that I cannot make the hon. Gentleman's day by announcing that we shall change to a consolidated bank and building society rate today. However, we recognise the changes that have been made in the financial lending market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the time lag. Indeed, we are voting on an increase just as interest rates have begun to fall, which might look rather odd to people outside. However, we have reduced the time
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
in which we can make changes to about the fastest possible. The Building Societies Commission is responsible for the calculation of the average rate, which is then passed to the Office for National Statistics. An average that triggers a change to the standard interest rate is implemented as soon as is practical following the publication of table 7.1L, which is about a month. The process to amend the standard interest rate involves an amendment to existing legislation—a process in which we are taking part today. That process, as you, Mr. Malins, know only too well, takes approximately five weeks in total. Up to two weeks are taken up with the necessary administrative actions involved. The amendment must be cleared through Ministers and checked with the Social Security Advisory Committee. The Benefits Agency must make the necessary programme changes to the income support and jobseeker's allowance computer systems so that we can pay the benefit, the importance of which I ask the hon. Gentleman not to underestimate. We must issue new guidance to ensure that the new entitlement is correctly calculated, print the statutory instrument, debate it, and put it into effect. Although it might not seem so from the time lag, we reckon that we have reduced that process to about as fast as possible, given how long it takes to produce the table on which we rely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The remaining three weeks is the time needed to satisfy the 21-day rule of the House that applies to all negative resolution instruments and that must elapse between the date of laying the regulation before Parliament and its operative date, unless the case is exceptionally urgent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The latest figures, for September, were published on 19 November in 	<i>Financial Statistics.</i> The new figure of 8.65 per cent., the subject of our debate, triggered a change in the standard rate because it is an increase of more than 0.25 per cent.—only such changes trigger a change in the standard rate, not every tiny increase or decrease. Amending legislation came into effect on20 December.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A delay in responding to changes is inevitable, but, as the hon. Member for Northavon was generous enough to point out, that applies equally to increases and decreases. Someone with an above average mortgage loses when interest rates rise, but when they come down, he is given a bit more grace and gets paid more than his actual costs until the time lag kicks in and the standard interest rate changes. There could be swings and roundabouts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There would be administrative chaos for the Benefits Agency is we had to track 3,000 individual interest rates, which is the only way in which we could move away from an average rate. There are 1,000 lenders and 3,000 different interest rates. We would quickly get back to the system that was justly criticised by the Public Accounts Committee and the Social Security Advisory Committee in 1995, which led to the change being made in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should also be a limit to the level of interest that the state should be expected to underwrite. Some lenders continue to charge very high levels of interest even when rates are falling. The issue here is how we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0155">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

achieve balance and where we draw the line. Does the state have to underwrite every single lending decision for buying a house, no matter how high the rates that were agreed to or undertaken? The latest statistical bulletin shows that some rates are as high as 11.3 per cent, and 10.1 per cent. Those rates are for people whose creditworthiness is not as obvious to some as to others. The Abbey National currently has a fixed rate mortgage at 9.1 per cent. I hope that the hon. Gentleman does not have that one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Should the state underwrite whatever lending decisions individuals take? I ask the hon. Gentleman to agree that we are not doing that; we can make a contribution, but we do not have to undertake to underwrite the entire thing. It was never intended that benefit levels should provide a totally comprehensive cover. We do not pay for capital or insurance premiums, for example. We do not pay for second mortgages. However, we believe that income support mortgage interest, or ISMI, provides a reasonable contribution towards people's mortgage costs. After all they are going towards the purchase of a valuable capital asset as well as maintaining a supply of housing services, as one could call them, to those with a mortgage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People should shoulder some responsibility for their financial decisions. Lenders should also shoulder some responsibility. We need to get the balance right between those who made the contract and the state, which would have to pick up the pieces of many repossessions. We think that we have got it about right with some changes that I hope to tell the hon. Gentleman about a bit later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Northavon made much of the difference between the standard interest rate based on that charged by building societies and the consolidated rate with the idea that there could be repossessions and arrears as a result. The current index no longer includes building societies that have been converted into banks, but 20 per cent. is still a significant percentage of those lending at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no evidence either that lenders repossess houses solely because of arrears resulting from the standard interest rates. On the contrary, lenders adopt a sympathetic stance to those who are in difficulties with their mortgage repayments and operate in accordance with conditions laid down in the mortgage code. Together with colleagues I am currently in discussion with the Council of Mortgage Lenders to monitor the code and to see what can be done to strengthen it as part of the partnership that was announced in the welfare reform green paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Repossession actions are usually driven by more extensive problems than anything created solely as a result of the shortfall between the standard interest rate and mortgage repayments. For example, divorce or separation is the largest percentage cause of repossessions, accounting for about 30 per cent. of them. Of those who are currently in arrears, 75 per cent. are not on any benefit. The hon. Gentleman should bear that in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
The hon. Gentleman spoke of rather wider issues on which he wanted an indication of the Government's views and position. He may remember that our manifesto commitment—which no doubt he read closely, if not during the election then probably since, as we all did and continue to do—contained a pledge to work with mortgage providers to encourage greater protection for families in a world of increased job insecurity. Flexible mortgages are part of the answer— there are different products. Homeowners also need better protection, and a wider take-up of effective mortgage payment protection insurance is needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the rather patchy and inadequate nature of current products— something which the insurance industry would admit. My hon. Friend the housing Minister and I have had discussions with both lenders and the insurance industry about a greatly improved mortgage protection insurance product, which I am happy to say should be available in the summer. We hope to educate potential borrowers about what they can expect from lenders, as well as from the state, if they decide to borrow money. This is the first sign of co-operation between the public and private sectors to try to achieve the right balance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Diane Abbott 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hackney, North and Stoke Newington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend referred to the quality of available mortgage protection products. She will not need to be reminded that, with the changing labour market in which so many people are in contract employment and short-term employment, a reading of the small print shows that very few of those products are available to people in short-term, temporary or contract employment. This is a serious issue. If mortgage protection is allowed to apply solely to currently available products, protection will not be available to many people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. I assure her that this is one of many issues that we discussed with the insurance industry when we asked it to come up with a product that will fit more closely the labour market that she described. Without giving anything away, may I express the hope that my hon. Friend will be reasonably content with the product—which will be a safety net below which no other product will fall, but which the industry expects to build on when it is launched in the summer?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have said that lenders and insurers have a responsibility to ensure that home buyers are adequately protected. The Government's welfare reform Green Paper identified better protection for homeowners as something on which closer partnership between the Government and the private sector could be fruitful. I trust that I have given a flavour of some of the work that we have done ahead of announcements to that effect. We hope that better cover at a reasonable price for the new standard mortgage insurance product will be available by the summer. Given those aims, I trust that members of the Committee will approve this extra help—which amounts to approximately £500,000 a week on account of those currently receiving income support

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Collins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Westmorland and Lonsdale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not detain the Committee for long. First, may I add my congratulations to you, Mr. Malins, for your admirable chairmanship, which has had a splendidly light touch so far. I hope that I shall not provoke you into departing from that. Secondly, I congratulate the Minister on her brilliant, persuasive and utterly compelling defence of the decision taken by the previous Government in 1995.1 was wholly persuaded by her extremely persuasive speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a couple of questions which the Minister may not be able to answer now, in which case I am content for her to write to me. First, can she tell us the likely extra cost to the public purse of today's changes and the total cost of the three similar changes made since the Government came to office? In its excellent research paper, the House of Commons Library informs us that one difficulty that occurs when interest rates fall—as they are now doing, with this likely to be reflected in the next changes to the regulations—is that because payments are often made directly to the lender they may not be passed on directly to the borrower, but may be used by the lender to pay off part of the principal. That is what the Library advises. If that is so, my second question is: can anything be done to discourage this practice?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I join the Minister in her defence of the Leek United building society, and add to that a defence of the Cumberland and Furness building societies. Many of my constituents benefit from the work of those excellent organisations. I am sure that the Cabinet enforcer and I would agree than if an organisation is big in Cumbria, it is big anywhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Webb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not aware that you were chairing a Committee for the first time, Mr. Malins. I congratulate you.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure whether the Labour party, when in opposition, supported or opposed the standard interest rate and the cut in support for the first nine months. I assume from the Minister's convincing defence of the current system that she supports it now and that she supported it when in opposition. The record will show that, unless she intervenes to say that that is not the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned 3,000 products and the attendant complexity. She overstated the complexity, given that many of those products have the same interest rates. Within a fairly broad range of interest rates, most products have the same rates. For example, many have the standard variable rate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman saying that it is Liberal Democrat policy to return to the old system?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Webb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to advocate a third way, which I shall describe. However, I hoped that the Minister would tell me whether she supported the measure when in opposition. I do not think that she knows, but I am happy to be corrected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that many of the 3,000 products have the same interest rates means that people who pay 7.45 per cent. on a 10-year, a five-year or a two-year mortgage all receive 7.45 per cent. Therefore, the extra products do not mean greater complexity. The range of interest rates is not especially wide and, therefore, not as complicated as the Minister implies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister presented information that was new to me. She claimed that only 20 per cent. of new lending was done by building societies. We could argue about what constitutes a lot and what constitutes a little, but a system that is based on only one in five new mortgages is not representative. There is no reason for the Government not to decide today—they should have done it 18 months ago—to base the interest rate, even if they have to use a standard rate, on those of organisations from which people borrow money, not on those of organisations from which four fifths of people do not borrow. There is no justification for the latter system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased that the Department tries to respond as quickly as possible to changes. If the Minister supports moderate compromises as well as taking account of all lenders, is the publication of table 7.1L and then another five weeks for good luck necessary? We know what the major lenders are doing within a week. Surely it is not beyond the wit of the Department of Social Security to devise a system that takes account of only the major lenders—perhaps the big four or the big six. If there has to be a standard rate, could not it be adjusted in a week, or could not the necessary statutory instrument be published in a week? That is preferable to waiting for the publication of a table and the current palaver, which seems wholly unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister asked whether the state should underwrite any sort of lending or any amount of interest. Perhaps there could be a cap, but the Minister portrays a choice between extremes: an average for everybody—that means an average of something that is not relevant, or my suggestion that everyone should receive a precise amount. Surely, between those extremes, there is a third way that better reflects people's actual interest rates while taking account of administrative complexity. Why, after 18 months, does the the Department continue to use an out-of-date interest rate process?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister claimed that the Government provided a reasonable level of support. That does not apply to the first nine months. Does no support for the first nine months for anyone who has taken out a mortgage in the past three years constitute a reasonable level of support? Surely the Minister does not believe that. Perhaps she does. The Minister claims that repossessions are not caused by the shortfall. It is not the sole reason for repossessions, but it does not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0157">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
help. If the shortfall adds tens of millions of pounds to people's mortgage arrears, it is clear that building societies will not be too thrilled about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary said that three quarters of those in mortgage arrears receive no help at all. Does not that belie the whole argument? Does not the fact that people will lose their houses because of mortgage arrears—most of them receiving no help from the state—suggest a huge gap in the system? Those concerned are the people—the low paid—about whom the Under-Secretary gave me no answer beyond improved private sector provision, and people in the first nine months of their mortgage. What we have been told amounts to a damning indictment of the system from the Under-Secretary's own lips. I hope that, having wasted 18 months on the issue, the Government will think again, and that the Department will plug the gaps.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, the hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Mr. Collins) asked about the extra cost to the public purse. The cost of the increase that we are concerned with is £500,000 per week. I do not have with me details of the cost of the other increases, but I am more than happy to write to the hon. Gentleman with them, pursuant to prior increases in the standard interest rate. Of course in a few weeks we shall return here—perhaps not under exactly today's arrangements—because the standard interest rate will soon fall pursuant to recent reductions in interest rates. No doubt there will be plenty more opportunities to debate the matters, should hon. Members wish to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am slightly concerned about the remarks of the hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale about lenders using the relevant money to pay for anything other than interest. It is not to be used for capital repayments and if the hon. Gentleman has any evidence that that is happening, perhaps he would let me know. It is explicitly against the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Northavon said that there are not 3,000 different rates—or that the rates of interest of different products are not that different. They are different when it is necessary to track them for every individual who makes a claim for jobseeker's allowance or income support. The interest rate being paid by that individual must be matched with the claim. If that rate is 7 per cent, in one instance and 7-5 per cent. in another, that creates complexity. The same interest rate might be charged by different lenders, but the Benefits Agency needs to approach those organisations to confirm that the individuals who are claiming are paying a certain rate, before that can be included in benefit calculations. We have more than enough experience of how that works out; it leads to underpayments and overpayments. There are huge complexities and the process is difficult to administer. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman—and I do not think that his third way works—is right to suggest that returning to that system is probably not sensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
The hon. Gentleman suggested using more global interest rates, with reference to the top five lenders, or something similar. That would be possible, but we should first have to change the primary legislation, where the relevant table is set out. It takes a long time to change primary legislation and to obtain slots for that purpose. Also, it is not true that the Ministry should respond faster. I am happy to take criticism about some of the administrative complexities of the DSS—some of them are blindingly obvious—but that is not appropriate in the present instance. The delays occur, first, with the Council of Mortgage Lenders, which compiles its table as quickly as possible, and secondly, to some extent, with the process of requesting Ministers to approve matters. Thirdly, delays are imposed by the parliamentary system for laying regulations and others are caused by the time it takes to print the statutory instruments and having the debate. As I have said, we believe that we have acted as fast as we can, given the system that we have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Northavon made a point about the low paid who are not unemployed but in mortgage arrears. I presume that he is saying that it is Liberal Democrat policy to make available mortgage support to those who are in work, as well as to those who are out of work. That is a huge financial commitment, and perhaps he could tell us how he would pay for it. He bandied figures about—£75 million and £45 million—during his short contribution. That means that he would add £120 million to the bill. If he extended ISMI to those in work, the cost would be massively higher. Is he about to tell us more?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Webb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The tens of millions that unemployed home buyers have lost as a result of the discrepancy and the slowness in catching up will be gained over the cycle, so there is no cost over the lifetime of Parliament. Unemployed people have lost money so far, but they will gain in future. There is no Exchequer cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On mortgage support for the low paid, we would reform the working families tax credit. Instead of supporting the child care costs of higher-rate taxpayers, the tax credit would be focused on the low paid, helping their mortgage costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could go on all day about the advantages of the working families tax credit, but I suspect, Mr. Malins, that you would show a slightly firmer hand in the proceedings if I were to do so. Perhaps the hon. Member for Northavon and I will have a chance to talk about that on another occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have looked at the Liberal Democrat manifesto, which confirms that they would introduce a new mortgage benefit for first-time buyers, combining mortgage benefit with the current housing benefit. Perhaps, at some other time, the hon. Gentleman will explain all that to me; it seems incoherent. Such a benefit would be very expensive if it were along the lines of some of what he has said today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The state does not have the job of underwriting every single lending decision that people make, but we have a duty to ensure that we can keep people in

reasonable stability as they go through periods of unemployment. That is why we are pursuing the new mortgage protection insurance, which is much better than available products, and cheaper. I confirm to my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) that the insurance will cover contract workers and part-time workers. We are working with the lending and insurance industries to try to improve such matters. We have got the balance
