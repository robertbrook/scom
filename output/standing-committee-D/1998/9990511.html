Draft Potato Industry Development Council (Amendment) Order 1999</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Jeff Rooker)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Potato Industry Development Council (Amendment) Order 1999.</p></blockquote>
I am pleased to see you in the Chair, Mr. Hood. I shall begin with a little background on the British Potato Council. It is responsible for commissioning or assisting research and development, the collection and dissemination of statistical and marketing information, the development of exports and the generic promotion of potatoes, including seed potatoes.<br><br>
The council is fairly new. It was established in May 1997 under the provisions of the Potato Industry Development Council Order 1997. Unlike its predecessor, the Potato Marketing Board, which was a producer organisation, the council covers all sectors of the potato industry, including growers, merchants, packers, processors, marketing and distribution and employees. The chairman of the council is independent and there is a second independent member. It has 16 members, nine of whom are growers; three are from the industry outside the growing sector, two are independent and there are employee and marketing specialists. The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food appoints them all.<br><br>
The council is an executive non-departmental public body, which is funded by a statutory dual levy on growers and first purchasers. There is no public funding of the council, although the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food purchases statistical information from it.<br><br>
In its short history, the council has won the support and respect of all sectors of the industry. It has reviewed its work and rationalised its activities in the light of the essential job to be done. There has been a sliming down of the organisation, with a move to more compact offices. That has achieved considerable savings in annual costs.<br><br>
Over the past year, some £3 million has been spent by the council on marketing and provision of information to the industry and consumers. Investment in research and development over the same period was £1.9 million. A successful potato technology event was held in May 1998, and followed by several technology transfer meetings around the country. In September this year, the British Potato 99 event will offer a mixture of machinery demonstrations, trade exhibitions, demonstration plots of potato crops grown under differing conditions and information transfer seminars.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
The council has also enjoyed success on the export promotion side, aided by its new database of British exporters which directs overseas buyers to those best placed to meet their requirements. Export missions introduce British exporters to buyers in target markets. They are often followed by inward missions, where potential buyers with Department of Trade and Industry sponsorship view Great Britain production at first hand.<br><br>
All that activity has certainly paid off, and that is a tribute to the industry. Although the pound has been strong and prices for the current season's crops are high— one cannot say that about many agricultural products— exports are currently more than 157,000 tonnes, an increase of well over 7,000 tonnes compared to the same time last year. That is a success under any test.<br><br>
On the marketing and promotion side, the major event was a new potato campaign that involved potato "dashes" to major centres, including the House, where potatoes were cooked by celebrity chefs. They were followed up with promotional recipes on GMTV.<br><br>
"British Potatoes in the New Millennium" will launch the current season in London on 19 May and in Glasgow on 15 June. The council also sponsors British chip week and, with the Sea Fish Industry Authority, the fish and chip shop of the year competition.<br><br>
Turning to the order, as I mentioned earlier, the British Potato Council is currently financed by a statutory dual levy on growers and first purchasers. The area levy applies to producers of one hectare or more of potatoes. The purchaser levy is paid by first purchasers of 100 tonnes or more of potatoes per annum and is known as the tonnage levy. Co-operatives and commission agents may recover the tonnage levy from the next purchaser. The tonnage levy arrangement has proven unpopular with the majority of merchants, who complain that it can give a competitor an unfair advantage if he is not a first purchaser.<br><br>
In response to the large number of complaints received by the council, it undertook to review the tonnage levy arrangements and develop a fairer system. Although this issue could have been addressed at the first statutory review of the British Potato Council in 2000, the strength of feeling among those paying the tonnage levy was such that the council completed its review in 1998 and asked that the proposed levy arrangements be introduced for the levy year commencing 1 July 1999. It would have liked it earlier than that, but consultation takes time.<br><br>
The order covers the amended tonnage levy arrangement. It removes the right of recovery of the tonnage levy by co-operatives and commission agents and requires that the levy is paid each time that potatoes are sold, except where the purchaser is a catering establishment or a retail seller of potatoes—unless such purchasers buy direct from the farm. As potatoes move through the chain, they will attract the levy at least once, but sometimes more often. Agriculture Departments consulted the industry on these proposals and the majority was in favour of them.<br><br>
The rate of levy is set each year following industry consultation and agreement by agriculture Ministers. The 1998–99 tonnage levy was 20p per tonne. The council estimates that changes to the tonnage levy would add
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0607">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
300 extra purchasers to the levy base, which will allow them to reduce this levy while providing an equivalent level of income. There is no intention to raise more money: the proposal is cost-neutral across the industry. To that end, for the 1999–2000 levy year, and anticipating the amendment order coming into force, the council asked agriculture Ministers to approve a tonnage levy of 15p per tonne. The current levy is 20p per tonne. Without the order, the council would have sought an increase—on a smaller base—of 1p per tonne.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Great Grimsby)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am following my hon. Friend the Minister's argument and enjoying the excitement of an order that is so important to a fishing port such as Grimsby. Essentially, the levy stops at the catering level—the point at which the customer buys the cooked product. The customer does not have to pay the levy. In that case, why does article 3(a) not include chip shops in its definition of catering establishments? It includes
<br><blockquote><p>"restaurant, canteen, club, public house, school, hospital or similar establishment",</p></blockquote>
but not the unique chip shop. Some chip shops like Harry Ramsden's buy several tonnes of potatoes. If chip shops are not specifically included in the list, there could be a danger of the levy being applied to them, when it certainly should not be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will take advice on that. I suspect that the chip shop, which is not a catering establishment, but which sells the product and buys many tonnes of potatoes over a year may be covered. However, I will provide my hon. Friends with a fuller answer to his question.<br><br>
The order also enables the council to add around 300 additional purchasers to its register and to obtain the required information and returns—statistical information, some of which is sold to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Finally, article 8 is an additional provision requested by the council on advice from its Scottish lawyers. Under Scots law, there is a need to clarify the position on evidential provision with regard to approvals given by Ministers. Article 8 accomplishes that and for completeness, and to permit the documents to be treated as prima facie evidence, the amendment also applies to England and Wales.<br><br>
No public money is involved in the matter although Ministers appoint the council. Full Nolan principles apply in respect of advertising, sifting of applications, and appointment of members. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food contributes to research in the industry. At present it is funding some 22 projects on potatoes at a cost of £1.2 million, two of which, hon. Members may wish to know, involve genetically modified technology.<br><br>
To reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell), lawyers advise—I was told to take account of m'learned friends' advice, unless one disagreed with them—that the definition includes chip shops, but I am not sure whether that includes places where one can eat in. There are, of course, different VAT arrangements, it becomes a different animal—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Charles Wardle <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bexhill and Battle)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help the hon. Gentleman. I have just been prompted
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
to read article 3(a), which the hon. Member for Great Grimsby raised, in greater detail. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"or similar establishment … where, in the course of a business, food is prepared for delivery to the ultimate consumer and is ready for consumption without further preparation;".</p></blockquote>
People walk into a fish and chip shop and buy chips. The only further preparation, which is a matter of taste and choice, is adding salt, vinegar or both. Surely, in that case, those shops are bound to fall within the definition of 3(a).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will check again. It may depend on whether one eats the chips from a plate with a knife and fork in the shop, which turns it into a catering establishment. The idea that a chip shop is not a catering establishment might come as a bit of a shock, but I suspect that if the shop has no tables it probably does not constitute such an establishment because of the VAT arrangements. I am no expert on such matters, but the finest chip shop I know—I must not advertise, so I will not say where it is—has a few tables and some people eat on the premises. That alters a shop's VAT arrangements, so it may change the legal definition of the end of the levy in the order. The matter must have been discussed before, given the current levy arrangements. There should be a clear-cut, simple answer, which I shall try to give the Committee before the end of our sitting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend and I hope that matters will be simplified. It would be invidious if a distinction were created, given that many fish and chip shops have a restaurant and a take-away service and are a major part of catering in urban centres. The industry is particularly important to Grimsby.<br><br>
I asked about article 3(a). There may be a solution in 3(d), which defines "processing" as follows:
<br><blockquote><p>"'processing', in relation to raw potatoes, means an operation carried out upon raw potatoes which includes peeling, slicing, heating, pasteurising, canning, freezing, drying, or any other similar operation".</p></blockquote>
It does not specifically include frying. <i>[Interruption.]</i> My hon. Friend laughs, but the subject must be taken seriously, because it is serious to fish and chip shop proprietors. If frying were included, it would get round the problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raises an interesting point, which must have been dealt with previously. I should have thought that "heating" would include frying, but I am not a lawyer—I do not know whether frying is a legally valid term in that sense. Therefore, I cannot answer my hon. Friend's question.<br><br>
The point of the order is to include more people in the chain. Three hundred more bodies will pay the levy at a lower level than at present. A reduction of 5p a tonne is no mean thing for an industry that is growing some 6 million tonnes of potatoes a year. We are not talking about small money. Some of the big fish and chip shops may be included. I see nothing wrong in that because it widens the levy-raising base and doing that while keeping the total income the same is beneficial as it reduces the rate. I look forward to hearing what members of the Committee have to say and to approving the order.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
<p>4.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Paice <span class='memberconstituency'>(South-East Cambridgeshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I also express my enjoyment at the fact that you are taking the Chair, Mr. Hood, for what some colleagues may have thought would be a brief interlude in their day's routine? The Minister has managed to make it last 15 minutes already and I will endeavour not to prolong it too long.<br><br>
An issue such as this is obviously of interest to me, not just because I am a Front-Bench spokesman on agriculture but because my constituency produces a large tonnage of some of the best potatoes in this country. It also contains many processors and operators at various stages from the farm gate. The Potato Industry Development Council which was set up under the previous Government was designed to ensure that the development role of the Potato Marketing Board, which was to be abolished, would continue, but without the quota and restrictions on production.<br><br>
It is essential that these studies go on and that the research and development is continued, not least because potatoes have given way over the last few years to pasta in the nation's diet. As we all know, virtually all pasta is produced from imported durum wheat, whereas potatoes can be home grown. There is obviously a domestic interest in maximising the consumption of potatoes.<br><br>
I was a little surprised that the Minister so fervently believed that he should not advertise. He is obviously under the illusion that anyone takes any notice of what we say in these Committees. I was also interested by his assertion that heating includes frying. I have been in fish and chip shops which have managed to fry chips without heating them, but I suspect that he is right.<br><br>
The Minister said that one of the reasons for the amendment order was competitiveness and that some purchasers had to pay the levy of 20p a tonne and others did not. However, he is still building in anti-competitiveness by leaving out caterers unless they buy direct from the farm. Some caterers will pay the levy and others will not. Some fish and chip shops will pay the levy and others will not if they source direct from the farm. I know that some do. Enshrined in the amendment order, therefore, is a continuing anti-competitive element.<br><br>
As the Minister said, the potato industry has been the only bright spot in the last couple of years in agriculture, which in all other respects is on its knees under the economic policies of this Government. It is crucial that we retain the potato industry's ability to be competitive. That is why the Opposition fervently support the need for this council to do its work and to be properly funded. It is also essential that the burden of funding is spread throughout the industry because, as we said when the council was set up, the benefit will go not only to the producer—the grower—but to all involved in the marketing and processing and the ultimate sale of potatoes.<br><br>
I, too, want to comment on article 3(d), which the hon. Member for Grimsby mentioned, and to say a little about the definition of "processing", not in terms of heating and frying but in terms of when a potato ceases to be a raw potato. The article seems to base the starting point on the term "raw potatoes". It is unclear to me when a potato ceases to be raw. Food processing firms, including many
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
in my constituency, take the potato from the farm, proceed with one or two processes—perhaps washing and peeling—and then perhaps slice it, or sell it to another processor, who slices it. The potato goes through two or three sets of hands before ending up with the person who cooks it and sells it to the consumer. Oven-ready chips, for example have been through a cooking process before being sold to the consumer. I hope that the Minister will allay my concern about whether article 3(d) of the amendment to the principal order is sufficiently precise about the definition of the term "processing".<br><br>
The Minister kindly reminded the Committee of the levy in the existing in the existing order—a maximum of £40 per hectare for producers and 25p a tonne for the first purchaser. I have already mentioned the need to include subsequent purchasers to get round the problem that has arisen and I have confirmed our support for that suggestion.<br><br>
The amendment order does not alter those ceilings. The Minister has confirmed that the BPC proposes to leave the producer charge at the current £35 a tonne, but to reduce the purchaser levy from 20p to between 12p and 15p a tonne. Looking at the overall resourcing, it appears that £4.7 million a year comes from the producer-grower, and that £773,000 comes from the purchaser system through the tonnage levy. That seems a significant imbalance between the producer and the rest of the trade.<br><br>
The BPC has estimated the 40 per cent, increase in tonnage—the 300 extra purchasers to whom the Minister referred—and stated that it can reduce the rate per tonne from 20p but still receive the same amount of income, which, on the face of it, is satisfactory. However, I am sure the Minister knows that the National Farmers Union is concerned that that may not happen. It is worried that the expectation of a 40 per cent, increase in tonnage could be a bit optimistic. I hope that the Minister will undertake to monitor the situation to ensure that the current income from the trade is maintained and that the burden does not fall more heavily on the primary producer. I trust that he will not only reassure members of the Committee, if necessary, but will intervene to retain the contribution at the right level.<br><br>
I am interested in hearing the Minister's views on the balance of the £4.7 million carried by the growers and the £773,000 coming from the whole processing and purchasing chain. The balance seems to be tipped heavily against farmers. As the Minister and I have said, farmers' incomes are already under incredible pressure. Thirty-five pounds per hectare works out at a little less than £1 a tonne—and perhaps considerably less for farmers who produce the most potatoes. At today's potato prices, that is not a great issue.<br><br>
As the Minister reminded us, potatoes are a free-market crop that do not receive public subsidy. However, only two years ago, the price of potatoes was dramatically lower, so that £35 per hectare may have constituted up to 2 per cent. of the total costs.<br><br>
Matters may turn round again. The latest issue of <i>Farming News</i> reveals that the council is already saying that acreage planted this year is considerably higher than that planted last year. Of course, that may well result in the significant price reductions which we have often seen in the past.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0609">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
Will the Minister examine the overall balance between the primary producer and those who take the primary product to subsequent stages? I am not convinced that that balance is entirely right. However, the Conservative Opposition support the proposal, and we accept that is necessary to include subsequent products.</span></p>
<p>4.56 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew George <span class='memberconstituency'>(St. Ives)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not detain the Committee any longer than is necessary. I simply bring news from west Cornwall that the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice) is right to anticipate that there will be a price reduction.<br><br>
Farmers in my constituency who have been harvesting new potatoes for the past couple of weeks, have experienced a significant price reduction from about £500 a tonne to about £250 a tonne in the past few days. That makes the harvesting of those corps uneconomic for some growers.<br><br>
We may be celebrating a general increase in potato prices, but there are still problems in the market. Before I came to the Committee, I did not realise how exercised Committee members could become about the good old British chip. However, I am sure that the Minister has taken on board the important points made by the hon. Member for Great Grimsby. Clarification would be most welcome.<br><br>
The bottom line is our concern about growers. I am sure that middlemen and women, people marketing potatoes, potato co-operatives in my constituency and others deserve appropriate attention. However, it is important that we take note of the anxieties of small potato growers who are experiencing difficulties in the volatile market that I have just described. That is especially true of those dependent on the high prices that can be obtained early in the new potato season.<br><br>
Last year, I was fortunate enough to host the British Potato Council's potato rush from my constituency to the House of Commons. The BPC is doing a great deal and I applaud its work. However, my constituency has so many new potato growers that concern about market volatility sometimes means that they do not always act in their own best interest and co-operate to keep the market price up.<br><br>
I would encourage the BPC to work more closely with growers and co-operatives to ensure that they understand how the market operates. That would help to avoid the incredible volatility in prices that we are now experiencing.<br><br>
I do not want to detain the Committee unnecessarily, so I shall simply record the fact that Liberal Democrats have no objection to the order. It is right to spread the costs as far away as possible from the growers, who have taken the brunt of the burden, and to clarify the terms used.<br><br>
I remind the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire that, as everyone knows, the best potatoes in the United Kingdom are grown in west Cornwall. Cornish King is the best.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Charles Wardle <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bexhill and Battle)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to detain the Committee. However, I hope that the Minister will clarify one point.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
The proposals will extend the base from which the levy is raised to include subsequent purchasers. The Minister said that income raised will be broadly the same, but is he satisfied that extending the base—albeit in a modest way—will not materially change the administrative costs of running the levy and the scheme? We heard earlier— and only partly in fun—that problems of definition may be looming on the horizon. Therefore, will he assure us that he does not expect the costs of administering the scheme to be dramatically changed by the proposals?</span></p>
<p>5.1 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In reply to the hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle (Mr. Wardle), I have no evidence that the administrative costs of changing the scheme will be a problem. I do not expect that, given the support that the industry has expressed for the change.<br><br>
We are a consulting Ministry, and we consulted on the proposals in 1998. I have a list of those who did not respond to the consultations, but I could not find a list of those who had. However—sure enough—the National Federation of Fish Friers responded, and it was consulted. It is happy to endorse the changes. That responds to the point about fish and chip shops.<br><br>
The National Farmers Union not only fully supports the British Potato Council, but fully supports the amended levy arrangements. I am not claiming that everyone that we consulted supported the proposals—some people do not agree with a dual levy—but the NFU and the National Farmers Union of Scotland support the changes. If we have the support of those two groups and the National Federation of Fish Friers, we more or less have things tightly stitched up.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that the NFU supports the order for the reasons that the Minister has rightly given. However, it has expressed concern to me about the consequential changes to the tonnage levy. Reducing it to a figure of l1p, 12p or 13p may not produce the £773,000 that the existing tonnage levy produces if 300 extra registered purchasers do not come on stream as the BPC expects. Will the Minister monitor the position to ensure that the total producer contribution does not fall as a result of the changes?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the BPC tells Ministers that the system is not working or is not as fair as it thought it would be, we shall certainly reconsider.<br><br>
I shall summarise what the NFU said in the consultation: it stated that it fully supported the BPC and was disappointed that it had been necessary to make changes in the order so soon in its existence. The NFU recognises that there have been anxieties about the current levy arrangements and that amendments to the council order have been proposed to address those concerns. The NFU completely supports the potato industry, which it says is vital to the council's continued existence. Any system for collection of levies should therefore reflect the need for all parties who benefit from the council's work to contribute on an equitable basis.<br><br>

That highlights the point made by the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire about the balance between growers and processors. In broad terms, the £6 million is made up of £5 million from growers and £1 million from processors. I have no idea whether that is fair, but I do know, having studied the matter in detail since the consultation started last year by my noble Friend Lord Donoughue, that I have seen nothing of substance that would overturn that balance. The present system is thought to be unpopular and unfair because it gives some people an unfair competitive edge and the order is designed to tackle that problem. Members should bear in mind that the council is a fairly new organisation, and its remit is essential to a vital industry.<br><br>
Notwithstanding my point about market fluctuations, we are dealing with an almost unregulated market. Markets work; a former Conservative Minister once preached to me about the magic of the market, saying that the market will provide and that prices will go up and down. If people see prices going up and decide to produce more, the consequence usually is that the price will go down. Thus there needs to be a balance; but we are exporting more than last year because of the success of the industry. We can sell our product because others wish to buy it, and we must take account of that.<br><br>
If problems arise from the implementation of the order and the BPC draws them to the Government's attention, I shall be happy to meet representatives to ensure that we get things right. We have consulted widely on the matter and there is majority support in the industry for the proposals. We want it to be implemented and to see how it works.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to be clear about the NFU's position. I quote what the NFU said in its letter to the Minister's officials, rather than what his officials have written for him to read out. The letter states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The NFU is concerned that any changes to the BPC levy arrangements should not result in a decrease in the total revenue of the BPC after any additional administrative costs have been deducted. Given the limited information available on the estimated additional tonnage of potatoes which will attract a levy, the NFU believes that caution should be exercised when setting the purchaser rate within the proposed range of 12 to 15 pence per tonne."</p></blockquote>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Bexhill and Battle said, we are considering the administrative costs. A 100-tonne purchaser who just scrapes in will pay £12 if there is a 12p per tonne levy, but that £12 does not generate a vast amount of administrative work in collecting that levy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that a case can always be made in respect of administrative costs if one is on the margin. There is no solution to that problem.<br><br>
In the course of implementing the order, which I hope the Committee will approve, if the problems raised by the industry occur we shall ensure that the measure returns to the House of Commons. It is not our intention that a new structure designed to be fairer than the present one should cause more problems. Clearly, that would be wholly negative. I am prepared to take note of problems if they are drawn to our attention.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Potato Industry Development Council (Amendment) Order 1999.</p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Committee rose at nine minutes past Five o'clock.</i></p>
