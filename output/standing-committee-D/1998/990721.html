	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Public Health (Ms Tessa Jowell)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I
beg to move,
	<br><q><p>That the Committee has considered the Local Government Finance (England) Special Grant Report (No. 48) on 1999–2000 Special Grant for Developing New Approaches to Commissioning Services for Drug Misusers (HC 513).</p></q>
The rather unusual procedure set out in the report should be put into the context of the Government's broad strategy for tackling drug misuse, especially among young children. I shall explain to the Committee why it is necessary to approve the spending of a relatively small amount of money in the specified manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Department of Health solicitors advise that under the special grant mechanism through which money for dealing with drug and alcohol misuse is channelled to local authorities, grants must be paid straight to voluntary organisations that will provide the required services. As the relatively small amounts of money allowed for in the report have been requested by the anti-drugs co-ordinator for examining and improving the way in which services for drugs misusers are commissioned by local authorities, such money will be held by the local authorities to which it is paid. We must consider the report in the context of that technical problem caused by the drafting of the current regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Relatively small payments will be made to the six local authorities whose bids in response to requests for submissions of interest have been judged to be of high quality. As I hope that I have made clear, the UK antidrugs co-ordinator regards the work funded by the payments as essential, as it covers issues such as differences in the commissioning of services and variable delays in different parts of the country in the referral of misusers for treatement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall briefly set the report in the context of the Government's comprehensive drugs strategy. Hon. Members will be aware that the strategy has four key objectives—young people, communities, treatment and availability. Through the comprehensive spending review, an additional £217 million is being made available to support the drugs strategy during the next three years. Of that money, £50 million will go to health authorities and £20 million to local authorities,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
to enable them to meet the drugs strategy's commitment to increase the number of drug misusers in effective treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The UK anti-drugs co-ordinator published his first annual report and national plan in May. The report estimates that there are as many as 100,000 to 200,000 problem drug misusers. That wide estimate shows the problem that we have in beginning to nail down more robust benchmarks for the number of people with whom we are concerned. The additional comprehensive spending review funding will increase service provision and begin to address one of the most chronic problems—the difficulty of getting drug misusers into effective treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The annual report also identifies general imbalances in service provision, such as a lack of adequate aftercare for misusers after treatment. Such a service is obviously essential to prevent drug misusers falling back into problematic drug misuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Returns from drug action teams around the country identify local shortfalls in the provision of appropriate services for particular groups most notably vulnerable young people and ethnic minorities. Current service commissioning does not always reflect underlying needs. Drug action teams provide a strategic overview, but their potential for joint working and planning has not yet been fully realised. With large amounts of CSR money available over the next three years, it is crucial that service commissioners work together to get the best value for the money available to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn briefly to the arrangements for the present financial year. Although the bulk of the £3 million available to local authorities in 1999–2000 through the CSR will go directly to provide new services through the drug and alcohol specific grant, officials agreed with the anti-drugs co-ordinator that a small proportion of that money should be used to develop new approaches to commissioning services for drug misusers. That should ensure that the new CSR money is used most effectively and that appropriate, flexible services are commissioned in line with local needs. As I have already stated, our legal advice is that the special grant report was the most suitable mechanism for paying local authorities to do that commissioning work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A circular was issued to all local authorities on 1 February, inviting expressions of interest in both the drug and alcohol specific grant for providing services and the proposed special grant for commissioning development. The circular called for commissioning work totalling approximately £60,000 in each of the four social care regions, totalling no more than £240,000. That guidance stated that information gathered in these projects would be disseminated to other local authorities receiving CSR moneys in future years. So the idea is to learn lessons from the six authorities and disseminate them more widely. The social care regions subsequently received 20 expressions of interest in the commissioning development work, and asked six authorities which met pre-agreed selection criteria to work out more detailed proposals. Those proposals included a pan-London commissioning project to be overseen by
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0626">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
Kensington and Chelsea housing and social services; a joint project between Portsmouth and Hampshire social services to address gaps in service provision; and proposals to encourage multi-agency commissioning in Peterborough, Liverpool and Salford.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should add that in producing the report, the Audit Commission, the Local Government Association and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions have been consulted. The Treasury has also approved this special grant report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am confident that the new approach is necessary, and will result in better working between local authorities and other agencies, such as health authorities and probation services. More broadly, the work to be funded by this grant, when disseminated more widely, will contribute towards the targets set out in the anti-drugs co-ordinator's annual report. Specifically, that means an increase in the number of misusers in effective programmes, a reduction in waiting times for assessment of need, and an increase in the number of funding decisions made within two weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have taken a little of the Committee's time to explain the background to the decision, its purpose and the way in which its success will be judged. I now commend the report to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.40 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Caroline Spelman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meriden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are grateful to the right hon. Lady for taking the time to explain some of the background; she has certainly done a better job than the Library has of getting to the bottom of why the Government have approached the measure as they have. That will probably save us some time this afternoon, as I am sure that everyone present will be pleased to hear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In trying to assess the importance of the report, we looked at it against the main objectives of the first annual report and national plan for the United Kingdom anti-drugs co-ordinator. It would be very difficult for us, in a spirit of constructive opposition, to oppose initiatives that are designed to tackle the very serious problem of drug abuse that afflicts this country. Being the country with the worst record in Europe of drug abuse is nothing to be proud of.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite that obvious problem, when we last debated the subject of drugs on 2 July—for the first time in this Parliament—the Minister for the Cabinet Office admitted that only a tiny percentage of drug misusers are in treatment. That compares very badly with best practice in other European countries, where up to half the drug misusers are in treatment. We understand the rationale for allocating public money towards more efficient commissioning mechanisms. None the less, I hope that the Minister will be able to clarify some points as we try to get beneath the surface of the document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of my concerns, based on what the Minister has said, is how quickly the information from the pilots will be disseminated to other local authorities. I have read carefully the history of the various approaches to tackling the drugs problem, and it seems to me that it takes a long time to evaluate and assess fresh initiatives
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
and new approaches. The good results from new approaches rarely seem to be disseminated quickly enough for other authorities to benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The targets that have already been set by the Department for a full assessment of its drugs strategy mean that no proper assessment will be completed before 2002. As a result, we shall be unable to assess whether the Government's strategy on drugs has been fully effective within the lifetime of this Parliament. I am particularly interested in how quickly the benefit of the new approaches on commissioning will be felt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a general concern as to whether in principle it is wise to parcel up public money in this way and throw it at local authorities to pay for such initiatives, while existing approaches have not yet been properly assessed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It appears from the description of the main features of the special grant in annexe B, that the new emphasis might be on those who are already, or are likely to become, dependent on drugs, and that commissioning will be in the area of prevention rather than cure. There are many good examples of new approaches to prevention, such as the Drug Abuse Resistance Education programme—DARE—with which I know the Minister is familiar. It would be useful, in the interests of saving public money, to draw some conclusions about commissioning from the DARE programme. There may already be lessons that can be disseminated from new approaches of that kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Also in annexe B, the targets of the special grant are more tightly defined in sub-paragraphs (i), (ii) and (iii). Closer examination reveals an emphasis on using the money to speed up the way in which things are done, rather than doing anything new. It is our belief that that is a priority correct?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is meant in sub-paragraph (i) by the term "problem drug misusers"? Surely all drug misuse is a problem. It is a subtle distinction between hard and soft drugs? I should welcome the Minister's clarification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Annexe B goes on to enjoin local authorities carefully to analyse, manage and monitor the new approaches. Those activities are inherently quite expensive and labour-intensive, and involve qualified staff carrying out monitoring operations. If we are not careful, much of the £30,000 to be allocated—that is the suggested amount for Portsmouth, Hampshire and Liverpool—could be swallowed up in the back-room work of commissioning and monitoring the new approaches, unless those costs were part of the £6 million to be allocated over three years to help fund the major new research programme which will evaluate programmes of activity, as mentioned by the Minister for the Cabinet Office in the debate on 2 July.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we do not intend to oppose the report, it is worth placing on the record some of our worries about approaches to drug misuse. Local authorities have expressed concern to us that there is an emerging pattern of short-term initiatives, whereby parcels of money are doled our from the centre to local authorities. That money may kick-start initiatives, but
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0627">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
they are not always sustained. Those who work on drugs problems complain bitterly about politicians' short-termism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency, there is a project called Cascade which is operated by a national voluntary organisation. Initially, it had a three-year grant from the Home Office, but it must now rely for its continuation on a combination of trusts and foundations. Every year it also gets £28,000 from the health authority and £25,000 from the local authority, some of which is from the single regeneration budget. We have just heard that the local authority has failed in its bids for continued SRB funding on the ground that it is too affluent. That highlights the concern on the part of local authorities that there is a stop-start approach to the funding of new approaches in their work on various problems, not just drug and alcohol misuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be interested to hear whether the Minister can give any guarantees that funding such as that which we are discussing today, which will be used for new approaches to tackle drug abuse, will be sustained to ensure that outcomes are effective and can be measured.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.47 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Allan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Hallam)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, am grateful for the Minister's description of the process. It was helpful in establishing how we have got to this point. We welcome what we hope will be money well spent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stress the urgency with which new approaches to drug treatment are required. I talked to the Sheffield coroner recently, and he calculated that there had already been 20 drug deaths in the Sheffield area alone in the first half of this year. He was expecting a record number of drug deaths this year. Most hon. Members know from our constituencies that there is an urgent need for treatment programmes, which are effective and would prevent such fatalities. The principal cause of those fatalities is, of course, heroin abuse, but there is a significant proportion of methadone abuse too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the targets that I particularly welcome is for a quicker gateway into treatment. The Minister also mentioned follow-up once treatment programmes were finished. The evidence from the Sheffield deaths shows that those who have just been released from prison represent a major category of the people who experience problems caused by lack of follow-up. Ironically, most had been cleaned up while in prison, or had come off drugs as part of a programme in another context, but then died as a result of taking what had previously been their usual dose of drugs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to ensure both effective follow-up and a quick gateway into the system. Waiting times to get on to drug treatment programmes are an absolute disaster for both the individual and the wider community. We need to be cognisant of the police estimate that someone with a serious heroin problem commits a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
property crime every day to fund his or her habit, so the gateway to treatment must be rapid for reasons of public policy, as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will try to improve treatment for young people, in particular. Many areas have major problems with people coming on to hard drugs at the ages of 13, 14 and 15. The facilities for them—especially residential facilities—are not there. When we debated the drug treatment and testing orders in the Crime and Disorder Bill, which was enacted last year, the Minister stressed that he wanted them to be available to younger people. However, we pointed out that even if such an order were made against someone, there would not be a place available. I hope that some of the new approaches that are being developed will be aimed at those under the age of 18.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is helpful that this is targeted separate funding, because the tendency of any local agency that is a commissioning body is merely to fund the existing programmes. That is a natural tendency—once something is up and running, one does not want to let people down by closing down existing facilities. To have an additional targeted sum on top of the mainstream funding can be helpful if one's core objective is to develop something new in addition to what one is already doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the money will spread into areas that have not traditionally been associated with drug use, such as Hampshire and Peterborough. People have traditionally associated drug abuse primarily with metropolitan areas. In North Yorkshire we have seen a major heroin use problem growing in the rural villages and towns—especially in the form of brown, which appears to be increasingly common. It is not treated as heroin by the users, which is significant— they do not see it as a great problem—but addiction rates are increasing, as has been highlighted in the local media. I am pleased that problems in fresh areas are being addressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will address the issue of linkage to other schemes in terms of the wider funding picture. I am looking at the hon. Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough (Mr. Ennis), and thinking about our experience of the objective 1 programme for South Yorkshire, which has given us our fill of "departmentalitis" and of trying to match funding pots with various objectives. That is of particular concern in terms of drug treatment. It is difficult for drug action teams to get clean money that they can use as they choose for local priorities. They constantly have to approach different parts of the social and health services. I hope that the Minister will give us her thoughts on providing drug action teams with clean money that they can use as they see fit. I do not expect her to deal with the objective 1 problem just yet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will also say a little more about the mechanisms for spreading good practice—whether that is through a network of drug action teams, social services, the probation service or health services. Various routes can be taken, and full value will not be achieved unless that is co-ordinated so that all the agencies can take advantage of it.

Liberal Democrat Members welcome this additional funding, which we hope points a way towards breaking out of the depressing cycle of trying to deal with the problem of getting drug abusers off their habits and dependence. So far, there has not been a brilliant record in achieving that objective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I remember a debate on the Floor of the House in which speaker after speaker stood up and condemned, in universal and unilateral style, the taking of drugs— everyone said how dangerous and terrible it was. I made the point that, if membership of the House of Commons more accurately reflected the population of the United Kingdom—specifically, if young people were proportionately represented on the Floor of the House, and had spoken frankly and openly—the speeches might have been very different. We cannot get away from the fact that half, or probably more, of all young people under 21 have tried some drugs at some point in their lives. For those of us who are older—my generation have no experience of drugs—simply to condemn is not enough; much more innovative measures are required. I welcome the opportunity that is offered by the report, which will allow a modest amount of money to go to some of the local authorities that have been in the vanguard of dealing with the drugs problem.

The hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan) said that he was surprised that Hampshire had been chosen as one of the areas for the pilot, because it is not normally associated with drug taking—would that that were so. I am afraid that my constituency, Gosport, and Portsmouth have significant drug problems. I have spoken to the police about this many times, and have learned a small amount about the taking and passing around of drugs. I learned some time ago that simply introducing drug testing does not always work. It is well known among prisoners that heroin passes through the body and the bloodstream much faster than cannabis; so, if they suspect that testing may be introduced, they are more likely, extraordinarily, to take heroin than cannabis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Innovative solutions are necessary. After the police were successful in rounding up a gang of cannabis pushers in my constituency, some members of the local population turned from cannabis to heroin. Clearly, I take no pride in the fact that Hampshire and Portsmouth have a special problem with drugs, but I welcome the fact that they have been chosen for the pilot, and I wish it well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Vincent Cable 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Twickenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall say a few words in support of my hon. Friend the Member for Hallam. I participated in the debate on 2 July—as did other Committee members—and the most striking statistics in that debate, which relates to the economics
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
of the problem, was that £1 of public expenditure saved £3. That is a remarkable example of productive investment, and there should be more of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On new approaches, I should like to emphasise two points. First, I want to stress the importance—which my hon. Friend touched on—of speed through the gateway. It takes four months to get on to an in-house detoxification programme; that is a national average, and I am sure that the time is much longer in some areas. On the basis of the daily crime figures that my hon. Friend quoted, I believe that a heroin addict would commit 120 offences in that waiting period. Anything that can be done to speed up the process is therefore welcome. Secondly, will the programmes help to alleviate the problems with regard to residential treatment? Over the past five years, the number of residential places for addicts under treatment has fallen by about 25 per cent. Is any action to stem that being considered?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On geographical spread, there is clearly a logic behind the areas chosen. In terms of future action, will the Minister consider the interesting and—for those hon. Members representing big cities—disturbing phenomenon of serious drug addiction migrating to the suburbs on a large scale? There are probably two reasons for the phenomenon. First, police in the suburbs may be less familiar with the routines of drug gangs that operate in inner cities, so the gangs assume that it will be easier to operate in the suburbs. Secondly, the pickings in suburban residential areas for those who have to steal to sustain their habits are probably larger. Will the Minister consider residential areas of big cities for his spread of experiments in the future?

I echo the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hallam on this welcome initiative, which we fully support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Raymond Whitney 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wycombe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had the privilege, 12 or so years ago, of filling the sort of job that the Minister is doing, and I worked in the same field. I am therefore sympathetic to the objectives of the grant. Although I understand that it is the tip of the iceberg of Government funding to tackle the drugs problems, I was struck by the small quantities of money involved, and by their dispersion. I am not sure what new initiatives can be introduced—and what can be achieved—with £30,000. That question requires an answer. I also feel that concentration on one or two areas might be better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I had experience in these matters, which was quite a long time ago, there was a reluctance, even locally, to look at what was happening nationally, and, nationally, to look at what was happening internationally. I do not intend to be denigratory, but the people who were responsible for looking after drug users were reluctant to take on new ideas from overseas. There is much to be learned from that, and I should be grateful if the Minister could cast any light on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can tell the hon. Member for Meriden that the results of the work will be available in 2000 to inform the strategy, so the work will be conducted in a short time frame. The hon. Member for Wycombe (Sir R. Whitney) was concerned that the amount of money for the pan-London programme appears relatively small—between £27,000 and £60,000—but that sum was identified by local authorities. It is a small amount of money, but it is highly targeted to help us to answer some specific questions. That is the key point. This is a small piece of a much bigger jigsaw. Many of the points raised reflect the sheer scale of the problem, and we do not underestimate that. For the first time ever, we have a co-ordinated cross-Government strategy which should enable us to deal better with the problems of fragmentation and to apply the lessons about what works and does not work to raise the standard of provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had some difficulty in assessing the precise number of drug misusers, which is between 100,000 and 200,000. The regional drug misuse databases show that some 30,000 people attended for treatment during the six months to March 1998, but an important job for the drugs co-ordinator will be to provide a sounder baseline against which to make judgments about volume demand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Points were raised about the weakness of programmes that are expected to work in isolation, and those points are well taken. The link with other schemes will be crucial, and responsibility for that will lie with drug action teams. Decisions on their funding will lie principally with the United Kingdom anti-drugs co-ordination unit. Many of the key providers are voluntary organisations, and they want stability and sustainability. The comprehensive spending review reflects the Government's determination to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
move away from the uncertainty of short-term funding. We fully understand the uncertainty that that creates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope that co-operation at local level will be improved by the new opportunities for joint commissioning under the new powers in the Health Act 1999, which has just received Royal Assent. I emphasise the point made by the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable), who cited the results of the national treatment outcome research study—NTORS. The compelling case for investment in drug treatment and spend-to-save is one of the reasons why we attach such high priority to getting more drug misusers into treatment. The hon. Gentleman was absolutely right to say that NTORS showed that for every pound spent on treatment, £3 is saved in terms of the costs of, in particular, the criminal behaviour of drug misusers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have dealt with the key points that were raised. As I said when I was talking about stability and sustainability, we are concerned about instability in the residential care sector. The deputy drugs coordinator takes a close interest in that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with those Committee members who discussed the importance of forming a proper national picture. We should not make the ill informed assumption that drug misuse is a problem that affects only the inner cities. It causes misery to families, and the crime that is associated with it knows no boundaries—it affects inner urban areas and increasingly, as the hon. Member for Twickenham said, also suburban areas and rural villages. Our comprehensive approach must take account of those important developments.
