Value Added Tax (Amendment) Regulations 1999</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nick Gibb <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Value Added Tax (Amendment) Regulations 1999 (S.I. 1999, No. 438).</p></blockquote>
The Opposition have prayed against the statutory instrument for two reasons: first, because of the huge amount of concern among exporters and export houses; secondly, because of the considerable damage that will be caused to British exports, particularly from small and medium manufacturers. The Committee will know that goods that are exported from the United Kingdom may be zero rated for VAT purposes, notwithstanding that, if sold within the United Kingdom, they would be subject to VAT at 17.5 per cent. Many large manufacturing companies, when they send goods for direct export abroad, are able to zero rate these goods. Smaller manufacturers that are not of sufficient size to warrant an export department tend to use export houses to find and arrange overseas markets for their goods.<br><br>
Since VAT was introduced, export houses have been able to procure goods from manufacturers without having to pay VAT on them, despite the export houses being based in the United Kingdom. They can do that if they can prove that the goods are destined for export. The consultation paper referred to that as zero rating of supplies one stage back from the actual export. The statutory instrument removes that exemption, so when an export house acquires goods from a United Kingdom manufacturer for export, it will have to pay VAT at 17.5 per cent. on them. The export invoice from the export house to the ultimate purchaser will be zero rated as before and the export house will be able to reclaim the VAT from Customs and Excise. Thus on a £100,000 order for tractor parts to Nigeria, an export house will now be required to pay £117,500 to the United Kingdom manufacturer of those parts, the Nigerian purchaser will pay £100,000 to the export house and the export house will reclaim £17,500 from Customs and Excise. If the export house moves from quarterly to monthly VAT accounting, it will take up to six weeks for the refund to be made.<br><br>
Some may say, "So what?", but it is important to remember that exporting is very competitive, particularly given the current strength of the pound and difficulties in the export market generally. An average margin for export houses is 3 per cent., but many margins are significantly lower. Assuming a margin of 3 per cent., a £100,000 order would yield a gross margin of £3,000. That is gross profit because all
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
expenses, overheads, costs of winning the order and so on must be deducted. To achieve that gross profit, £17,500 would be tied up for six weeks and with a borrowing rate of 10 per cent., £200 of interest would be charged, which is quite a chunk from a gross profit of £3,000.<br><br>
Those figures are not based on the reality facing export houses; I plucked them out of the air. Small businesses with small profits and tight banking facilities face significantly higher banking costs. I have received a fax from an export house showing that borrowing £17,500 for six weeks would cost £743 in interest and bank charges, with a possible additional £50 in security and revisal fees. At a 5 per cent. mark-up, that would constitute 27 per cent. of the profit, which is a significant chunk. At a 3 per cent. mark-up, it would constitute 45 per cent. of the profit.<br><br>
In a written question, my hon. Friend the Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale) asked the Paymaster General about the cost to United Kingdom export houses of the imposition of VAT on goods purchased. She replied:
<br><blockquote><p>"It was not possible to arrive at any accurate figures for possible costs to export houses as insufficient evidence was provided in response to the consultation paper. However, by opting to change to monthly VAT periods, some export houses may gain a cash flow benefit."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 11 May 1999; Vol. 331, c. <i>91.</i>]</p></blockquote>
Representatives of export houses will laugh at the last part of that answer. Rather than a benefit, they face a significant cash flow disadvantage. How can the Government proceed with the measure when they have no accurate figures on the impact on such companies?<br><br>
In addition to extra costs, export houses will have to complete monthly, rather than quarterly, VAT returns. That will be 12 a year instead of just four, which constitutes a considerable increase in administrative work. The Government will argue that some manufacturers prefer to charge VAT because, in dealing with export houses and zero-rating their supplies, they are required to obtain proof from the export houses that the goods have been exported. Where such documentation is not forthcoming, Customs and Excise imposes penalties. That argument is probably valid in respect of large manufacturers who can export directly. However, as John Dale, of John Dale and Associates, an export house in Kendal in Cumbria, said:
<br><blockquote><p>"If such manufacturers are … unable to cope with the current provisions"</p></blockquote>
then they are
<br><blockquote><p>"free to … insist on transacting such business only on condition that they charge VAT. I deal with one or two manufacturers who prefer to deal this way without any difficulties so why the need to change"?</p></blockquote>
In other words, it is possible for such manufacturers to charge VAT. Some manufacturers do not want to charge VAT because, in doing so, they would lose business. They do not see why it should be compulsory and the export houses agree with them. The problem is that most commercial arrangements undertaken by export houses will be unable to withstand that extra cash flow cost.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0512">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
The second argument that the Government will advance is that they had to change the law because the European Union said so. The consultation document states that UK domestic law on VAT and export houses must comply with article 16(2) of the EC sixth VAT directive. However, in a letter to an export house, Mr. Mault, from Customs and Excise, said that that article is not mandatory. As many export houses have confirmed, other European Union countries are not taking the step that the Government are taking. David Kelly, of Edghurst Ltd., in Hawkhurst in Kent, said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Part B4 of the VAT information sheet indicates that it has become clear that the so-called UK export house VAT provisions did not comply with EU legislation. From talking to German and Italian contacts, no VAT is charged now on goods which are invoiced to a fellow national company but are exported to another country, and there is no indication whatsoever that rulings in Germany or Italy are to change."</p></blockquote>
As the Paymaster General said in a written answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford,
<br><blockquote><p>"The exemption from VAT on supplies to export houses is an optional measure in EC VAT law… we have very scant information about other countries' use of the measure. Customs and Excise is taking up with the European Commission claims made by a number of British businesses that some other countries operate export house provisions which do not fully comply with EC law."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 11 May 1999; Vol. 331, c. <i>90.</i>]</p></blockquote>
The Government are introducing a statutory instrument that will extend the VAT base on the pretext that the European Union insisted on that. However, it is clear that the European Union is not insisting on that, before they proposed the regulations, the Government did not research the situation in other European countries. It is scandalous that so little research has been carried out on the costs on export houses in the United Kingdom and on the effect that that will have on competition.<br><br>
We may be told that the Government have scant information about other countries' use of the measure, but does not the Paymaster General have an obligation to obtain that information before introducing the regulations? In effect, she has proposed regulations that will put British companies at a huge competitive disadvantage, although the Government have not bothered to research the situation in other EU countries.<br><br>
The third argument that the Government may use is that they have consulted widely and that only two dozen people responded to the 150 consultation documents that were sent out. Of those responses, half were in favour of the current VAT situation and half wanted it scrapped along the lines suggested in the regulations. The Government might use the defence, "Oh, we've consulted, and everyone we consulted said that the proposal was okay." However, that is the last refuge of a Minister who knows that her justification for the change does not stack up.<br><br>
How real was the consultation process? Robert Kemshell of the export house Network International Group Ltd., which is based in west Yorkshire, said that Customs and Excise had sent the consultation paper to 167 locations. He continued:
<br><blockquote><p>"As we are led to believe, most of these locations were not directly involved with exports."</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
In a written answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford, the Paymaster General said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The organisations to which the consultation paper on the withdrawal of export house VAT provisions were initially issued were the Joint VAT Consultative Committee, the British Exporters Association, the Simpler Trade Procedures Board… and the United Kingdom Oil Industry Taxation Committee. Subsequently copies were issued to more than 150 enquirers, including Tax in Industry and the Institute of Export." —[<i>Official Report,</i> 11 May 1999; Vol. 331, c. <i>91.</i>]</p></blockquote>
The export association was mentioned, but what is its view? It lobbied strongly for the retention of the current zero-rating arrangements. Despite that, the Government decided to ignore its views and to abolish those arrangements. Despite the view of the trade association and the fact that other respondents were equally split, the Government plumped for abolition. The views of 12 respondents clinched the matter for the Government.<br><br>
How many export houses were sent copies of the consultation document? I have done my own consultation, and I can come up with considerably more than 12 companies that are against the proposal. I shall list them.<br><br>
Company number one is the Network International Group Ltd., which I mentioned earlier. Mr. Kemshell said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We rely on our Government to support British Exports. By imposing VAT on one section of British Exports, you are doing substantial damage… We estimate that you are putting at risk well in excess of £50 million per annum … We and other Export Procurement… Houses, are currently being forced to cancel orders to British Companies, in favour of those on Mainland Europe and elsewhere, VAT not being a problem from those areas… We can simply not stand the financial burden you have imposed and survive. Naturally we are having to explain to British Manufacturers, why the business is going to others."</p></blockquote>
Mr. Kemshell went on to discuss the consultation process. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"the very limited response you received to your consultative document … is not actually surprising, when you consider who the document was actually sent to. It should have been sent to the companies involved in Exporting and Procurement for Export, rather than unconcerned or biased organizations."</p></blockquote>
Company number two is Goddard Export Services, which is based in Harrogate. Its managing director states:
<br><blockquote><p>"For the past eighteen months British Companies exporting goods have had a very difficult trading period due to various economical reasons, which has seen many companies going out of business. Those of us who have survived now find ourselves being held back by our own Government… This decision will affect employment and as a member of the SME Panel on the New Deal Scheme, I am concerned that companies selling goods overseas will not have the funds to take part in this scheme, we will certainly not be able to take a New Deal client on board".</p></blockquote>
Company number three is John Dale and Associates, which I mentioned earlier. Its representative states:
<br><blockquote><p>"part of my business required me to supply such VAT free invoices as part of my own export documentation… If suppliers do show VAT on their invoice then we have to reinvoice on our own forms."</p></blockquote>
That involves the company in enormous amounts of administration.<br><br>
Company number four is Edghurst Ltd. Its representative states:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0513">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"As most export houses such as mine work inevitably on very small margins, we will be hit tremendously…. The biggest fallacy of the whole situation, however, is that if we source goods, for example, for a client in Nigeria from a UK manufacturer, we are penalized by having to pay 17.5 per cent. VAT thereon… yet, if we buy what could be the same goods from elsewhere within the European Union, or indeed any other country at all, we pay no VAT. In either scenario, we would not physically handle or be in control of the goods."</p></blockquote>
Another company—number five—MSW Machinery (International) Ltd., has written:
<br><blockquote><p>"My company was set up in 1970 mainly to export to Third World Countries. We began by making small tractors designed for Africa and the Indian sub-continent…. Since then we have been shipping refurbished, new or 'off-farm' tractors and agricultural equipment and have many satisfied customers in Kenya, Nigeria, Somalia, Trinidad, Bangladesh and elsewhere. We also supply hospital equipment. … Hitherto VAT has been waived on the purchase of most of the goods we export against proof of shipment. … Removal of these arrangements will inevitably affect cash flow and profitability and hit UK exports."</p></blockquote>
Company number six—Compass Oilfield Supply Co. Ltd., based in Great Yarmouth in Norfolk, states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Our company is involved in the supply of equipment and spares to the petrochemical industries and 98 per cent. of our turnover (£3.9 million) is export business. The revised process of having to pay VAT is causing us to lose business as we have to carry this additional amount on our cash flow."</p></blockquote>
Company number seven, Eltham Export Ltd., based in Woolwich, London, states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The negative impact on our cash flow is substantial and has necessitated our moving to monthly accounting for VAT … greatly increasing the administrative workload …We perceive this as another nail in the coffin for struggling exporters … It is time someone stood up for British exporters, whose job is difficult enough without the negative contribution from HM Customs and Excise."</p></blockquote>
Opposition Members are standing up for British exporters and I hope that the Government will try to do so this afternoon.<br><br>
Company number eight, Hi-Pro Ltd., based in Twickenham, states:
<br><blockquote><p>"What this means is that in many cases we are having to pay out to the local suppliers more than we will receive on the exports"— <i>[Interruption.]</i></p></blockquote>
I am sorry if this is distracting for the Paymaster General, but if the consultation process had been as full as it ought to have been—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Paymaster General (Dawn Primarolo)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Be careful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that the process started in August 1996. The hon. Lady can make as many party political points as she wishes, but this decision is being made by her Government, and this statutory instrument is causing damage to these companies. There are more companies in my list than there are in her consultation document. Let us go on to company number nine, Source and Supply Co., in South Hendley, Yorkshire, which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The removal of VAT exemption is yet another strategy introduced by the Government which will assist in undermining the already extremely vulnerable export business."</p></blockquote>
Company number 10 is Melvale, based in Cobham, Surrey, which states:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"Our company's export turnover is about £4 million per annum. The present policy means that we have to fund cash flow to the extent of £700,000 per annum to finance VAT paid for our exports. This obviously means extra bank interest and extra costs to us which make us uncompetitive and lose business to our competitors in Europe."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Did the hon. Gentleman ask the export companies what the effect on their compliance costs would be if the Government were to apply the rules in their entirety, including the cap that is supposed to go with the relief?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I doubt whether the hon. Lady has done so, because most of these export houses have had no discussions with Ministers. All that they have had is a standard letter, sometimes signed by the hon. Lady, more often by officials, containing the same wording that was sent to all export houses. It is up to the hon. Lady to consult the export houses, and I want her to do so before proceeding with this statutory instrument. The companies want the existing arrangements to remain untouched, so that they can remain in business.<br><br>
Company number 11 is TPS Technitube in Horsham, West Sussex. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"we had no previous knowledge about this forthcoming change which was implemented on 1 April 1999 until this week… Customs confirm they undertook a consultation process and issued 150 copies of a paper to a cross section of businesses… As a company involved primarily in exports I am just completely and utterly shocked by the way this appears to have been introduced and the supposed reasons for it."</p></blockquote>
Company number 12, J and S International Ltd., in Glastonbury, states:
<br><blockquote><p>"my business is exporting shoe components and materials to world markets. Up to 31 March 1999 my UK suppliers were able to invoice me and zero rate the VAT as I supplied proof of export … I do not trade in the UK. This all changed on 1 April when all my UK suppliers have to charge me VAT at 17.5 per cent."</p></blockquote>
Company number 13, E P and S Overseas Trading Ltd., in Camberwell, states:
<br><blockquote><p>"My Company, established for a number of years, is a small to medium sized export purchasing organisation. We purchase from British Manufacturers whenever possible… The recent increase in Fuel Prices is gradually filtering through to Freight in the UK, putting up the cost of UK goods to the Port. Even so, we still have attempted to "BUY BRITISH", whenever possible.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>The recent changes in the VAT Exemption Rules… are now severely damaging our Overall Business Capability. I cannot stress this strongly enough. This decision has not been thought through clearly at all."</p></blockquote>
The 14th company, R.A.W. Munro, states:
<br><blockquote><p>"As a small Company, we have had to change our way of working completely to cope with this nonsense. As far as possible all shipments must be sent and invoiced at the end of the month. The reason for this being that we have had to change to monthly VAT returns in order to stay in business. By getting the VAT back (hopefully) before we have to pay, we can continue in business."</p></blockquote>
That company is being forced to time its business at the end of the month to minimise the period for which VAT is kept by Customs and Excise. At the beginning of the month, the company would have to wait for up to six weeks before receiving the VAT back.<br><br>
The 15th company, Heb-Bel Ltd., in Huddersfield, states:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0514">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"We are a very small business with limited finance. Our turnover in 1996 and 1997 was £163,000 and £188,000 and our operating profit £7,761 and £3,069… How can we now get the extra £31,500 to finance the VAT."</p></blockquote>
That is a real difficulty for a company making a profit of£7,000 a year.<br><br>
The 16th company, International Holdings Ltd., in Dewsbury, states:
<br><blockquote><p>"For small firms like ourselves who's 95 per cent. of trade is export, the position is tragic… In all developed economies firms like us play a very important role in the economy and it is important to assist and nuture these firms."</p></blockquote>
The 17th company, SEL Exports Ltd., in Sheffield, states:
<br><blockquote><p>"We are a very small Export business, established in March 1994, with a moderate annual turnover, which at its peak reached £330,000 … The removal of VAT Exemption would result in closure of our business due to these new rules imposed by the Labour Government. Our calculations indicate that the cost to finance the VAT aspect will result in an unprofitable venture."</p></blockquote>
That is the result of a consultation exercise that I carried out with export houses. I hope that the Government will undertake to carry out a similar exercise. Such an exercise would allow the Paymaster General to discuss with export houses the technical rules relating to the cap and the three options set out in the consultation document.<br><br>
Seventeen companies have expressed their views against the Government's changes, in addition to the 11 or 12 that have already done so. I urge the Paymaster General to rethink the statutory instrument.</span></p>
<p>4.52 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey <span class='memberconstituency'>(Kingston and Surbiton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Liberal Democrats share some of the concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb), especially those about the impact on cash flow costs, which is the most severe aspect of the statutory instrument. In their report on the consultation exercise, the Government tried to suggest that the administrative cost savings of the change—the reduction of error and confusion arising from the different types of VAT returns administered by suppliers and export houses—would somehow compensate. I should like to emphasise, as the hon. Gentleman did, that the case, on cost grounds, has not been made.<br><br>
The Government could have taken another approach to comply with article 16(2), as the Paymaster General implied in her intervention. Does the research that Customs and Excise has carried out show whether that approach would not have been more efficient and less costly for the business concerned? Would it have been able to deal with the administrative costs involved, and save on the cash flow costs, which are very significant?<br><br>
The Government could also have adopted a third approach—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stephen Pound <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ealing, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: A third way—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says a third way; perhaps there is one. I do not normally subscribe to that philosophy, and I am sure that the hon.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
Gentleman does not really subscribe to it. I do not want to be ruled out of order by you, Mr. Malins, so I shall return to the matter before us.<br><br>
The third option would have been to decide, in greater negotiations and discussion with the European Commission, whether there was another way forward.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford asked the Paymaster General how VAT exemptions for supplies to export houses were administered in other EU countries. Her reply was informative. She said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The exemption from VAT on supplies to export houses is an optional measure in EC VAT law and we have very scant information about other countries' use of the measure. Customs and Excise is taking up with the European Commission claims made by a number of British businesses that some other countries operate export house provisions which do not fully comply with EC law."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 11 May 1999; Vol. 331, c. <i>90.</i>]</p></blockquote>
The European Commission should give us answers. We should know what is happening in other EU countries. Are we handicapping our businesses by pushing this measure through when other EU countries are not going to abide by the law? There should be an EU-wide approach because this unilateral approach will disadvantage our companies. My hon. Friend the Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett), who is making a guest appearance in the Committee, will go into more detail.</span></p>
<p>4.56 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Burnett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Torridge and West Devon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: These regulations will have a significant and adverse impact. Their repercussions will be felt throughout our great exporting industries.<br><br>
The regulations refer to renumbering. Is that necessary to correct an error in the Value Added Tax (Amendment) Regulations 1998? Errors are made in statutory instruments. The motion before us is ill-judged and ill-considered. I refer the Paymaster General to the Value Added Tax (Finance) Order 1999, which we debated in Committee on 25 March 1999. I counselled the Financial Secretary to wait for the result of the impending FDR tribunal hearing, which was germane to the order. Following the success of FDR in the tribunal appeal, and on the basis of European law, does not the Paymaster General agree that a large tranche of that order is dead in the water?<br><br>
I want to make a preliminary point before I discuss the export aspect of the order. On the definition of "overseas visitor", will the Paymaster General confirm that a visitor from a non-EU country will still be able to reclaim VAT through the retailer?<br><br>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton and my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) rightly concentrated their fire on the repercussions on exporters. Exports are crucial to this country. The Committee should be greatly concerned about the cash flow of exporters. Margins for exporters are low, especially given the strength of the pound. Export houses will no longer be zero-rated.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is wrong. Export houses are still zero-rated. He will waste his time if he bases his argument on that proposition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burnett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me put it another way. Export houses will suffer a cash flow disadvantage. They will have to pay VAT and wait up to six weeks or two months before recovering it. Will the Paymaster General confirm that every export house will be entitled to make value added returns on a monthly basis?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can help the hon. Gentleman. As part of the concession, every export house will be able to make a monthly return.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burnett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to hear that. What conditions will the Government impose on Customs and Excise to ensure the swift repayment of VAT to exporters?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman like me to answer that now? The time allowed is a maximum of six weeks and a minimum of one week. The average is three weeks and 95 per cent. of claims will be repaid within 10 days.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burnett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And what remedy will there be for exporters in the case of a delay longer than, say, the maximum period that the hon. Lady has just adumbrated to the Committee? Can the Attorney General—I mean the Paymaster General—tell me that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. I have not yet been promoted to the giddy heights that he initially suggested.<br><br>
The remedy that is laid down in the VAT legislation is open to any trader to whom VAT has not been paid on time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burnett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Paymaster General, but that is not good enough. We are introducing a significant VAT cashflow to our exporters at the very time when they can least afford it—when their margins are being crushed and sterling is at its highest.<br><br>
The regulations are not mandatory under the sixth directive, so why have the Government chosen to penalise our exporters? The provisions are ill-judged and ill-advised, and militate against our export efforts at a time when our exporters can least afford it.</span></p>
<p>5.1 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the appearance of the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon as a guest speaker in the Committee. I think that I answered all his questions bar one, which is the one with which I wish to begin. It will put in context the change in the regulations.<br><br>
We must take a history trip back to the previous Government's administration of export houses. There was a legal challenge in the UK against the partial operation of the rules on export houses. There was a more liberal regime then—I use the word advisedly; I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
am not talking about the third way, in case any of my hon. Friends think that I am—and only some of the required rules were operated.<br><br>
A trader was assessed as breaking the rules on zero-rated supply to an export house. Unfortunately, in return the trader claimed that the legal basis for the export house provision was deficient—which it was, because there was only a partial operation of what was provided within the EC regulations—and that the assessment was therefore invalid. Thus, there was a legal challenge against rules that were being only partially operated—the capping rules were not being operated. That led the previous Government and my predecessor, the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) to decide, rightly, that we could not leave the rules unchanged. He therefore decided to consult on two options: the removal of the liberal arrangements, or a move to the full rules.<br><br>
I want to pick up the points made by the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton, but first, on a matter of procedure, it is clear that the hon. Gentleman based almost all his speech on letters that had never been sent to Customs and Excise—even though we had asked for traders' views. Those traders did not decide to express this view to Customs and Excise when they were being specifically asked to do so over a period of nearly two and a half years.<br><br>
On a matter of procedure, are the right hon. Members who tabled the motion aware that if the House has sat for more than 40 days between the date on which the instrument was laid before it and the date of the passing of any resolution, that resolution has no automatic legal effect? This procedure is dogged by people being asked to express their views in a reasonable time period and not complying with that. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton did not pray against the instrument within the time period laid down by the procedures of Parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Paymaster General give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall finish my point, and then I shall be happy to give way.<br><br>
My parliamentary answers reflect what I am about to say. The Government agreed to today's debate although there was no compulsion on us to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oliver Heald <span class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Hertfordshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Paymaster General give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Please may I finish my point? The Government's agreement to the debate indicates the openness and co-operation that we have demonstrated from the outset in consulting on this issue. Today provides the opportunity for me to respond to the points that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton has made, despite the fact that none of those points have ever been made to Customs and Excise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Many of the businesses that I have quoted have been in correspondence with Customs and Excise, and I have copies of its responses in my file. Mr.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0516">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
Robert Kemshell has been particularly assiduous in corresponding with Customs, and with the Paymaster General, on this matter.<br><br>
With regard to the hon. Lady's point about parliamentary procedures, the statutory instrument was prayed against within 30 days, which is the rule of the House.<br><br>
A more important point is that, until 1 April, many export houses were not aware of the rule that they could no longer zero rate their purchases. That is when they realised that they were in serious trouble, and started to write to many Members of Parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In fact, those traders were told on several occasions and asked to respond, even to the point where the Government extended the consultation period and wrote to them specifically on issues to do with compliance and any additional burdens on their businesses. They may have changed their minds now, but that is not the argument that was deployed during the consultation period.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Paymaster General give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I should like to make some progress in answering the hon. Gentleman's points, because he has advanced a totally incorrect case, which does not reflect what the Government have done in this area.<br><br>
Businesses are not requried to charge VAT on goods that they export directly to customers outside the EU. Such exports are—and, I must stress, remain—zero rated for VAT. However, supplies to customers within the United Kingdom are of course normally liable to tax. The export house provisions were an exception to that rule—an exception to the very basis of VAT legislation. They allowed zero rating for supplies by one British business to another—that is, to UK-based export houses. In other words, as the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton himself said, it is zero rating one stage removed from the actual export of the goods. That is where the problems and legal challenges start.<br><br>
At this stage, it is important to say that the only change that we have made is to withdraw that one-stage-removed zero rating. Export houses can continue to carry out their useful function as middlemen between UK suppliers and overseas customers. They can continue to zero rate the actual exports and, of course, recover the VAT that the UK supplier now charges to them. I have given the time periods in which that will be done.<br><br>
In EC VAT law, relief for sales to export houses is an optional measure. It allows countries to zero rate the goods—the option is to zero rate, not whether to operate the rules—and associated services that one business supplies to another, which intends to export them. We did not apply the VAT rate to the supply of services. However, that relief for sales to export houses is subject to a capping measure—the value of the exports by the export house during the preceding 12 months. Many export houses and associations responded to the consultation on the basis that putting
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
the full measure—the services and the cap on the value of exports—in place was a worse option than removing the VAT from the supplier to the export house.<br><br>
The problem with UK export house provision was that we only partially implemented the regulations as required in UK law. They did not include relief for associated services or the cap. Like the previous Government, we were concerned about the legality of that arrangement and about the scope that it offered for potential abuse. We saw that in the legal challenge, which occurred because a trader misused the rules.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burnett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Paymaster General give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to come on to the point about consultation because it is at the heart of what hon. Members have argued. What they are saying is simply not the case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Paymaster General give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me make the point, and then I will give way.<br><br>
In August 1996, Customs and Excise, with the agreement of the Paymaster General under the previous Government, the right hon. Member for Wells, issued more than 150 copies of a consultation paper to a cross-section of small and large businesses, trade bodies, firms and professional organisations. I know that there is collective responsibility in government and that Conservative Members do not want to accept responsibility for what they did in government, but it is a bit rich for them to criticise me, as the Minister now, on the basis of what their right hon. Friend did.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Paymaster General give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I shall continue to make the point about consultation. I will then be happy to take an intervention.<br><br>
The former Paymaster General's paper explained the position, outlined the various options and asked for comments, particularly on the impact that the withdrawal of the provisions might have. The consultation did not excite widespread interest, which was—well—a surprise. Fewer than two dozen replies were received, as I said in my written answer. Export houses naturally maintained that the provisions were an important export facilitation measure. Most suppliers to export houses—the people who make the exports—said that the rules created considerable administrative difficulties, which were often disproportionate to the level of trade that was involved. When asked, therefore, the manufacturers said that the scheme was not good. So there is a flaw in the argument of the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. He suggested that terrible damage would be done to exporting and manufacturing, but the very people who make the goods to export—he did not survey them—said that the scheme was not good.<br><br>
It was also clear that the use of the provisions had widened considerably and exceeded their original purpose. The replies received were evenly balanced for and against withdrawal. There was little support for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0517">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
full implementation of the option by including relief for the associated services coupled with the value of the cap.<br><br>
The British Exporters Association—the trade organisation that represents many of the export houses and, one would assume, speaks on their behalf—saw this as
<br><blockquote><p>"very much a second best option"</p></blockquote>
to the Government's proposals. The Tax In Industry Group, another organisation that one would expect to know about the trade, said that implementation of the relevant European Community law—the cap and services— would be
<br><blockquote><p>"an administrative burden and potentially unworkable"'.</p></blockquote>
Not only the export houses were consulted. The people who use them were also consulted about how the measure would impact on their business.<br><br>
Customs and Excise recognised that the withdrawal of the provisions would have cash flow implications for some businesses. It met the British Exporters Association and agreed to extend the consultation process by two months, to give the association more time to provide evidence of the extent to which withdrawal of the provisions might be detrimental to United Kingdom exports.<br><br>
Customs and Excise also asked the association to consider how cash flow disadvantages might be reduced if businesses submitted monthly VAT returns. No additional constructive evidence was forthcoming, despite that request.<br><br>
The consultation exercise produced some sound arguments in favour of withdrawing the provisions, but no convincing case was made for their retention. Withdrawal of the provisions relieves suppliers of the need to chase the necessary export evidence within the set time limits. We are also helping the manufacturers, whom Opposition Members are so keen to assist. Withdrawal also removes the possibility of a legal challenge and gives the system certainty.<br><br>
A thorough review of the options, which also took into account the opportunity that businesses would have to minimise any possible cash flow disadvantage, resulted in the decision to withdraw the provisions from 1 April 1999. That decision was publicised in June 1998—in addition to the consultation that had taken place—by means of a business brief and VAT information sheet. Every VAT-registered trader was told individually about the change on two separate occasions by means of "VAT notes" sent out with VAT returns in June and December 1998. People study their returns very carefully and look at everything in the envelope, so it cannot be argued that by including such a note with the VAT return we were not giving them the information. Businesses were given at least six months' notice so that they could change their accounting arrangements.<br><br>
As I explained earlier, the zero rating of supplies to export houses is an optional measure in EC law. It is unclear how our European partners deal with this
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
option. Some companies have made complaints which we are, rightly, pursuing, as I explained in Written Answers.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton mentioned Robert Kemshell and said that he had written. He did not write in during the consultation period, but did so after the decision was taken. He did not write when notification was received, or when information was sent directly to him. It is a bit rich for the hon. Gentleman to advance the case that we did not consult properly. We have done everything humanly possible to get information to traders, to ask them specifically about issues that may concern them, and to hold a debate in the House—which we were not obliged to do, because the measures have no automatic legal effect now—in order to make it clear why the decision was taken.<br><br>
The clear advantage in the rules is given to manufacturers, who do not now have to complete paperwork, as they did before. That has not been mentioned by Opposition Members, although they are terribly concerned about manufacturing. We have included a concession, which means that the companies concerned—export houses—can do VAT returns on a monthly basis, which will be properly dealt with. Frankly, I do not understand what the Opposition are complaining about at this late stage. Short of being mind readers, it is difficult to see what else the Government could have done. I ask the Committee to support the motion.</span></p>
<p>5.20 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Paymaster General seems to want to have it both ways. She said that the people whom I have cited had not written—she did not mention in her complaint that they had not written before the consultation period expired; she said that they had not written. They have written, once the VAT notes and business briefs that she lauds arrived in their post. People who have looked through the paperwork that they receive in bulk from Customs and Excise have then complained. Whether they complained during the consultation period is not the point. Many of them had not received the consultation document, for whatever reason. Once they knew about the arrangements, they wrote to Customs and Excise and their Members of Parliament—including me and the shadow Chancellor.<br><br>
The sort of companies that have been affected by the measure are tiny. Some are businesses that retired people have set up, and are run from a garage or a study. Nevertherless, they have turnovers of about £300,000 to £400,000, and provide a useful service to small manufacturers. Such people do not spend hours sifting through VAT documents or have VAT advisers in the City of London. They may well have changed their minds.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burnett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to my hon. Friend and the hon. Gentleman in a minute.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0518">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
I urge the Paymaster General to consider changing her mind, if those people have changed their minds. We live in a democracy; those people will be hurt by the measure. The least that she can do is rethink the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that one of the great dangers of government is to treat the Whitehall machine, the way in which regulations are implemented, and so on, as though they are sacrosanct? The longer that one is in government, the easier it is to adopt that frame of mind. The people who are giving a cry for help in those letters are trying to make a living.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a valid point; that is one of the dangers of being in government. It appears that the current Government have reached that stage after only two years in office.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burnett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the Paymaster General has not understood that most exporters who are manufacturers do not use an export house, they simply make a zero-rated supply overseas? We are talking about a niche market that is important to our exports. <i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are all trying to listen carefully to what hon. Members are saying. One or two conversations are becoming a little too noisy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burnett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are dealing with niche operators— export houses—that are important to our overall export effort.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. The hon. Lady accused me of not referring to manufacturers in my opening remarks. I did refer to manufacturers and made the very point that the hon. Gentleman has just made. Large manufacturers, who will respond to a consultation process, do not need export houses. When they have had to deal with them, that has proved cumbersome for them. They can quite easily export directly overseas themselves and obtain the advantage of zero rating.<br><br>
It is small manufacturers which do not have the capacity to send one of their directors abroad on an export sales mission, or to have a large export department, which need small intermediaries to provide a market for their goods abroad. It is those manufacturers that will suffer and lose business. Export houses will be determined to stay in business, and they will want to supply their customers in a cost-effective way. In order to do so, they will probably have to source their products from companies outside the United Kingdom. That is a great tragedy. Simply by implementing one statutory instrument, the Government will cause enormous damage to the small and medium-sized sector of manufacturing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Davey</span><span class='membercontribution'>: While the hon. Gentleman is speaking of small export houses, will he speculate on whether, if they had the choice, they would prefer the option in the directive to be fully implemented with the cap, as the Paymaster General explained?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a good point, and the answer to his question is that I do not know what those export houses would prefer. If there is a legal challenge, the Government must engage in a consultation process. I have engaged in a small one; the Government should engage in a large one. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The Government are putting right regulations and ensuring that the law conforms with practice in other provisions. Indeed, they are doing so in the Finance Bill. If the regulations are not being fully and correctly implemented, they should do the same with them. Instead of ensuring that the law conforms with EU law, which is not mandatory but purely voluntary, the Government should change it to conform with the practice that has been in place since the introduction of VAT in the early 1970s, some 30 years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that the Government should impose 17.5 per cent. VAT on export houses?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am suggesting to the Paymaster General that the regulations should be changed to conform with the practice of zero rating supplies passing from manufacturers to export houses and of allowing them to be zero rated externally. If the regulations do not allow for that, why do not the Government change them so that they do? The point about legal challenges would then no longer be relevant.<br><br>
The Paymaster General said that the rule affecting export houses is an exception to the basis of VAT. She is right—it is an exception, but it is not an outrageous one. Exported goods are zero rated, and export houses are merely a stepping stone towards exportation. They are not a normal intermediary in the usual sense of the word. Most products do not even touch the export house, and go straight from the supplier to the overseas customer. The involvement of the export house is administrative; it finds the customer and processes the paperwork.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend think that the Government are introducing a stealth tax by requiring the export houses to lend 17.5 per cent. of what they buy to the Government for three weeks on average, if performance is as good as the Paymaster General hopes?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We must be careful not to stray from the very narrow regulations before us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend made a good point, because the regulations extend the VAT base. The Government have said that there would be no extension to VAT, as did the Chancellor in the House, but there have already been several exceptions. The regulations are yet another exception, as they extend the VAT base. If the Labour party were in opposition now, they could count this extension as one of the 22 Tory taxes they identified, as such extensions were counted among them.<br><br>

The Paymaster General spoke about the consultation document. She is right—it is a very good document. It was produced by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells and was published in August 1996. It sets out fairly the three options available: to comply with the article, to withdraw the provisions or to maintain the status quo. Those were the three options, and the Government have made the decision, not my right hon. Friend. The document was published nearly three years ago. The consultation period ended in December 1996, and the Government have taken the decision to implement the regulations—it was not the previous Government's decision to implement them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not true. Ask a parliamentary question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is now May 1999—two years since the election—and the regulations have come before the House for the first time. Is the hon. Lady suggesting that the regulations were considered by the House before then?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I pointed out, the previous Government ruled out the status quo as an option because of legal challenge. This Government agreed with that, because it was the correct decision. The right hon. Member for Wells took a decision, and if the hon. Gentleman cares to ask him when he next sees him, he will confirm that. If he is unable to do so, I will be happy to assist through a parliamentary question or a letter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am unaware of what advice my right hon. Friend was given by civil servants while in government—I thought that such matters were confidential. I know that the published consultation paper said that there were three options. Option three—to attempt to maintain the status quo—was put out to consultation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burnett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman share my concern, to which I alluded, that the advice given to the Government might not always be correct? That might be the cause of the complete chaos resulting from the FDR case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right—advice is not always correct and it is for the Government to make the correct decision. I have presented the case of the people who will suffer, including 17 case studies.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
The Government are basing their decision on 12 responses to its consultation exercise. My 17 cases outweigh the Government's 12. I feel sincerely that the Government should go and think again about the decision.<br><br>
Consultation processes are not perfect; people are not spending their whole time thinking about tax policy. Generally, people learn about measures only after implementation, and they are being affected. As the hon. Gentleman said, small businesses will be affected severely—many of them will not survive the impact of the measure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dawn Primarolo</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that the Government should never consult trade bodies representing many companies? From now on, should we go directly to companies and ignore the trade bodies? By going to such bodies, we assume, as might any reasonable person, that they speak on behalf of their members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gibb</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady misrepresents the view of the British Exporters Association, a body that has lobbied hard against the regulations. It might not have wanted the second option, but it does not want the option that the Government have proposed. Export houses, to a man and woman, have expressed their hostility to the statutory instrument. For the sake of equity, I urge the Government to rethink the measure before they cause enormous harm to people struggling to make a living.</span></p>
