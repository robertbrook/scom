</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oaten</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you back to the Chair, Mr. Malins, and welcome the fact that our deliberations on the Bill are now on the home strait. We were making good progress until something happened late last Wednesday night, but we are now nearing the end of the Bill. Clause 51 and the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel) and myself contain some important provisions relating
	<span class='label label-info column'>822</span>
to disability. We are getting to the heart of the Bill when we can consider whether it is fair to disabled people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I were the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies), who is good at being outraged and using colourful language, now is the time when I would use it. However, I am a milder person than the hon. Gentleman, so I shall leave it to him to say how disgraceful he thinks these provisions are. The proposals cause a great deal of concern among the disability sector. I hope that when the Minister and his colleagues address the Committee, we shall hear how they judge the changes. I believe that the Government want to be fair to disabled people, but these changes, specifically the changes to the timing and period of contributions, will have a great impact on individuals who receive incapacity benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am unclear about why the Government have proposed these changes. It cannot be for the benefit of those individuals whose contributions will be changed, so it must be the Government's desire to reduce the number of people on incapacity benefit. We have heard much from the Conservatives about Alastair Campbell being the force behind many of these changes. The changes seem to be led by a desire to establish not an appropriate welfare system, but a welfare system that is led by the Treasury's demands for cuts. It is interesting that the right hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley) said that the conservative party no longer regards welfare as an issue of saving money. That would seem to put the Government firmly out of place on economic issues. Clearly, these measures must be the result of a desire to reduce the cost burden of incapacity benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During last week's sittings, the Minister said that he did not believe that the change from the all-work test to the capability test would reduce the number of individuals who would be eligible for benefit, so we can only conclude that the Government think that the proposals are a way of taking people off incapacity benefit. When we discuss later amendments, I want to explore whether there might not be a better way to achieve that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals have been widely criticised by the disability sector. Ironically, in relation to certain amendments last week, we were all singing the praises of disability groups and saying how invaluable their contributions were. Although no Opposition members would expect the Government completely to buy in to the points made by such groups, we would have expected some of their very valid points to have found more of a listening ear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not only the disability sector that has raised concerns on this issue. On Second Reading, on 23 February, the Government Benches were packed with rebels—that is the best way to describe them—eager to intervene and get in on the debate. Their concerns about those changes were led by the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field). During that debate, when the changes to the contributions outlined in this clause were being discussed, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is impossible to square the provisions on incapacity benefit with the despicable phrase about something for nothing. We are talking about people who, through their working lives, have persevered and struggled to get back to work, often many times, after suffering disability. They did that in the knowledge that their contribution conditions were safe—they had to make only one year's contributions in the whole of their working lives—but now that is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0922">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>823</span>
to be changed and they will have had to make one year's contribution in the past two years."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 23 February 1999; Vol. 326, c. 247–248.]</p></blockquote>
That is the opposite of what the Labour party said before or during the election, and even once in government and presenting the Bill. The right hon. Member for Birkenhead sums up the concerns of Labour Members, of the disability sector and of the Liberal Democrats. It is not only politicians who have a reputation for caring about these issues. The Law Society, in its briefing on the Bill, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the tightening of the contribution conditions for incapacity benefit to restrict entitlement to claimants who have recently been able to work will merely result in people with long term disabilities having to depend on income related benefits."</p></blockquote>
There is therefore widespread worry about the proposed changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What has happened to the Government's principle of something for nothing? There will be many cases where individuals have made contributions and will now get no benefit in return. In some cases, these changes could lead to individuals with a contribution record of 10, 20 or more years, who become disabled after a period of unemployment, being unable to get anything back from their contributions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the new criteria, there could be an illogical case of a person who has made 15 years' worth of contributions being unable to get incapacity benefit, while someone who has made contributions for just one year is able to get that benefit. That seems fundamentally unfair. Even if we shared the Government's aim of trying to reduce incapacity benefits by changing the contribution requirements, there must be a fairer way of doing it. I shall be interested to hear whether Ministers will acknowledge that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the two-year period is inappropriate. However, if the Government must go down that route, perhaps they will consider a different benchmark or measurement. If the contribution requirement were set at two years out of the previous 10 years, that would make the system fairer. Alternatively, as we suggest in amendment No. 139, the amount of contributions made over a life period could be the trigger for benefit eligibility, rather than the dates between which the contributions were made. For example, if a person had made 10 years' worth of contributions, it would not matter when in their working life they had been made. It would matter that they had built up those contributions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another group of amendments deals with the fairness of the system relating to people who might now be ineligible for incapacity benefit. I am pleased that the Government have recognised that there are groups of people—especially carers and parents—who will find it difficult to build up the contributions required to obtain benefits under the provisions. Amendments Nos. 137 and 138 probe the Government to see whether they have fully thought out the mechanisms by which they will allow carers and others to bypass the contribution requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wording of the Bill needs to be much stronger. It allows for exemptions, but we would like to see the provisions tightened up so that people receiving invalid
	<span class='label label-info column'>824</span>
care allowance would be exempt from the contribution requirements. I ask the Minister to clarify how the government will address this matter, and to ensure that those receiving the care allowance will not be affected by the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our concern goes further than that. We welcome some of the indications that the Government are prepared to consider the matter. However, we need not only to have protection firmly incorporated for those on invalid care allowance; we also need to know the Government's plans for other carers or parents who do not get invalid care allowance. That cannot be the only factor by which we measure whether someone is a carer. About 400,000 of the 6 million carers in the country receive care allowance. Many carers, therefore, are not receiving care allowance and cannot build up contributions. How will those people be affected by the changes? Have the Government thought of ways to allow them to receive the benefit to which they should be entitled? It is not their fault that they have been helping out the state by being carers and have not been able to make the necessary contributions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have made few concessions. The amendments, particularly those that relate to the fairness of the changes with regard to disabled people, allow the Government to make concessions. If the Government are not prepared to accept the fundamental principle that they are taking the wrong line, the narrow matters of the period in which contributions are built up and of the guarantees for those carers who have not been able to make contributions, are ideal for reconsideration by Ministers. They should give concessions to disability groups who believe, as I do, that the changes are unfair to disabled people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Grantham and Stamford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have now made a great deal of progress on the Bill. We have been sitting for nearly two months and have seen different aspects of the new Labour Government's regime under which we have been living for the past two years. Stakeholder pensions, with which we began, showed us the amusingly shambolic face of new Labour, which had devised a wonderful new compulsory and universal pension scheme based on the Australian model. At the last moment, new Labour removed the compulsion and left us with a structure that did not make sense. The trusts and supposed cheapness of the scheme, on which there was no need to take advice, no longer applied. We have seen new Labour as a shambolic party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our debate on pension sharing on divorce showed the politically correct new Labour party enforcing some unpleasant elements of unfairness on the public. We saw the disagreeably discriminatory treatment of those who were losing pension under a split.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This last part of the Bill brings us to the particularly unpleasant aspect of new Labour as the party of the means test—new Labour, new means test. We discussed the abolition of the widow's benefit and its replacement by the means-tested bereavement benefit. We saw some less attractive aspects of what the new Labour Government are doing, but I am afraid that in clauses 51, 52, 53 and 54, we reach the nadir of unpleasantness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not be making jokes this morning—or, indeed, this afternoon—about Alastair Campbell or anything else because we are in difficult country. The Government are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0923">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>825</span>
proposing sinister measures. Let us be clear about the reality. They are trying to claw back a large amount of money from people who would be entitled to it under the national insurance system. They cannot get away with that. The Government clearly stated the amounts in the explanatory notes. When the savings take full effect, they plan to save £700 billion a year on incapacity benefit—[HON. MEMBERS: "Billion?"] I am sorry. They plan to save £700 million on incapacity benefit and £100 million with the abolition of the severe disablement allowance. Some charities that work with disabled people calculate the former figure to be £750 million. Whatever the amount, a lot of money will be withdrawn from a vulnerable group of people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any humane or sensible Government would avoid a measure that is so obviously inhumane and vicious. Most Governments who are obsessed with their image would at least do the right thing for the wrong reasons. Most Governments would say, "We are going to make massive savings in our welfare system. We shall run down the national insurance aspects of our welfare system, which is the inheritance of Beveridge and his successors, but we shall do so in such a way that we are not seen to be penalising those who are most vulnerable—those who are disabled and who, in many cases, will never again be able to work or to lead an ordinary life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why did the Government, who are so sensitive about their image, stoop to advancing those proposals? There is a clear, but unpleasant explanation. A hard-headed, cynical calculation has been made. If a Government reduce the disposable income of any group of people, they will pay an electoral price, which will be reflected in discontent and in a fall in their standing in the opinion polls. If they increase taxes, let inflation run, increase mortgage rates or do anything else to reduce people's current purchasing power, they will pay a price.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security (Mr. Stephen Timms)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A moment ago, the hon. Gentleman suggested that people on incapacity benefit may not work again. Does he acknowledge that a large number of people on IB will work again? Is not the problem with the system that we inherited the fact that it abandoned people on benefit? The help and support that the Government's proposals offer those people mean that they may be able to work again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister obviously does not like the theme that I am developing, and he is trying to deflect me from it, although he will not succeed in doing so. However, I shall give a straight answer to his not entirely relevant question. Of course, we all hope that people who are invalided at some stage in their life will ultimately be fully cured and restored to full health and vigour. However, in many cases, that is not even a theoretical possibility. Some people may be restored to sufficient health and vigour to enable them to work again, but in a different role. The Minister should put himself in the position of people who are disabled and who bravely fight back. They may take a job and go out to work in the morning, but they may be in pain when they do so. They
	<span class='label label-info column'>826</span>
will not go to work with the confident enthusiasm that they previously felt. They will not know when the symptoms of a particular problem will reappear—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Shaw 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chatham and Aylesford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman in a few moments, but not in the middle of my sentence or paragraph.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that Labour Members are capable of the elementary effort of empathy that is needed to put themselves in the situation that I have described. Many people who return to the labour market will never be able to play the role that they had before. They will have had to abandon their lifetime's aspirations and their settled way of life. They will have had to abandon their aspiration for a higher income. The Minister should not think that, because 50 per cent. of those who have been disabled manage to return to some form of employment—as a result of a complete cure—a completely satisfactory solution has been found to the problem that has afflicted those people's lives. That is not the case. Many people's lives, hopes and plans will have been permanently shattered, even if they are able to return to work to a limited degree. According to the Minister's figures, 25 per cent. to 30 per cent. of such people will never work again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are moments when the Minister of State tries the Committee's patience. I shall be blunt—can he imagine how it would feel to suddenly find himself blind, deaf or crippled in a wheelchair? Can he imagine how that would affect his life? Can he imagine how he would respond to being told that he could still obtain some kind of employment, even though he was blind? He made a cruel and thoughtless remark, which—I am afraid—expresses all too clearly the spirit that pervades the new Labour Government. That spirit has led to these pernicious proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was saying that one of the problems of people with disabilities is having the confidence to find work. If they find work, they may worry about losing their benefits if they are unable to sustain that work. Our extension of the linking rule from eight to 52 weeks will give people the confidence to find new work, as they will be able to return to benefit if their new work is unsustainable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want the hon. Gentleman to think through carefully—perhaps not in the Committee, but in the silence of the night—the point that I have just made. The kind of work that people may be able to do in the circumstances that he describes may be very different as a result of their affliction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Levitt 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(High Peak)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note in passing that the hon. Gentleman is referring only to incapacity benefit and not to all the other disability-related benefits, for which the people he described would still be eligible. People who suddenly become deaf, blind or otherwise disabled, and who lose their employment as a result of their disability, would qualify for incapacity benefit within the two-year period. We would not merely wish such people
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0924">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>827</span>
to return to employment, but—pious hopes aside—help them to do so. Furthermore, we would help them to stay in employment when their disability hits them. The hon. Gentleman is missing the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have clearly touched a nerve. A systematic attempt is under way to deflect me from my line of my argument. It will not work. The hon. Gentleman's point is a complete red herring—I did not mention benefits other than the incapacity benefit because we are not discussing such benefits. You would have corrected me, Mr. Malins, if I had done so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already explained to the hon. Gentleman that, although such people will be able to return to work, that does not mean that they will be able to return to the position that they were in before the initial affliction that caused their disability. Clearly, I am in favour of every serious effort to help people who are willing and able to return to the labour market—even if only to a limited extent—to do so. However, that is not a reason for proceeding down the Government's line, as I shall demonstrate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. McKenna</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is wrong to think that he has touched a nerve: he has totally distorted the facts, which is why Labour Members are incensed. Many young people are desperate to get back to work, but they do not have access to the support that is needed to help them to achieve that. Professional people have always had access to professional organisations, executive agencies and so on, but young people with little experience who are disabled, or who suffer a debilitating illness have no such opportunity. They will now have the chance to get back into work, because we shall have given them the support that they desperately need.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady makes a completely unexceptionable contribution to the debate—indeed, it is most sympathetic—but it has nothing to do with what I am talking about. She knows that we are at one in hoping to improve the services that are available to young people and others who are disabled. I have shown my good faith by endorsing the idea of job-orientated interviews and so forth—so long as it is genuine help and the adviser is not a stooge from the Benefits Agency trying slyly to withdraw benefit. We discussed that issue the other day. I made it absolutely clear that the Opposition support genuine initiatives designed to help people back into work, if they are willing and able.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>828</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rendel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way, particularly as he assumed that I was about to support the Government. In fact, the opposite is the case. I wish to make a point supportive of the hon. Gentleman's argument. Surely, if the Government are genuinely trying to help those people who have perhaps suffered some incapacity, the very worst thing would be to remove their incapacity benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a strong point, and I apologise for my false assumption about the reason for his wanting to intervene.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour Members may well be incensed by the time that I have finished my analysis of why the Government have gone down this road. I look forward to hearing from them if they think that they can persuade the Committee that my analysis is wrong. I shall not be deflected from asking why the Government have introduced this extremely unpleasant and invidious policy. How did a Government who are notoriously conscious of their image find themselves in such a situation? I shall answer that question with a hypothesis; if Labour Members can persuade me that I am wrong, I shall withdraw it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hypothesis not only makes theoretical sense; the Government's record shows that they have made an entirely cynical decision, of which they are perhaps secretly proud. The hypothesis is that, if one reduces people's disposable income—for example, by, increasing taxes or reducing public expenditure—one will pay a political price in the short term, but if one can claw back that money in such a way that it does not affect people's immediate disposable income, they will not notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People will not look at the value of a future reduction in their disposable income or of the benefit income to which they might otherwise have been entitled. The pensions tax, which is relevant in other parts of the Bill, and the abolition of the dividend tax credit enabled the Government to claw back no less than £5 billion a year, year in year out, from our pension funds. Perhaps the Government thought that the public were too innocent or too foolish to realise that the money was being taken out of their pockets—because it reduced future incomes rather than today's because the pension funds are still accumulating and because people are not yet in receipt of those pensions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the Conservative Administration's change to the state pension, basing it on prices rather than earnings, is a parallel example?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon.

He is doing his Front Bench no favours by making such irrelevant interventions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman wishes to address my analysis head on, let him do so. If he wants to tell me why I am wrong, let him do so—instead of which he tells some sort of story about what a previous Conservative
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0925">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>829</span>
Administration did, which is completely irrelevant. Mr. Malins, you would not want me to pursue that matter; it would not serve the Committee to do so. I am talking about enormously important matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People in the Committee Room—perhaps there are such people behind the Barrier—who either work with disabled people or are disabled, will find it equally insulting that Labour Members make such irrelevant, cheap political jibes when we are discussing such an eminently serious matter for the future of disabled people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point is made because no one has risen from the Labour Benches to show that my analysis is wrong. Why have the Government decided to claw back £700 million under the clause, and another £100 million under clauses 53 and 54, from disabled people? Of course, the Government hope that disabled people will not realise that they are the victims of that reduction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None of us knows when we may become disabled. None of us knows when we may need to call on the national insurance benefits for which we pay all the time—at least, all those of us who are lucky enough to be in work. No victim has been identified, so no group of people is prepared to tell the Government, "You are taking £700 million away from us and people like us." To show the magnitude, we know that about 2.5 million people in this country are disabled, but significantly less than 2 million people receive incapacity benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making several varied points and is in danger of straying towards a clause stand part debate. Depending on how the debate develops, I shall make up my mind whether to have a clause stand part debate. The amendment is fairly narrow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that guidance. I should not like to deprive the Committee of an opportunity to have a clause stand part debate on a matter of crucial importance. In fact, together with clause 42, the clause is the worst aspect of what is a pretty bad Bill. Sometimes it is bad merely in that it is incompetent—sometimes funnily so—but no other clause is as savagely inhumane as this one. I shall not be drawn further down that road, despite the fact that Labour Members are tempting me. I shall reserve some of the remarks that I might otherwise properly have made in an introductory speech on the clause for the stand part debate. I shall go further in that good faith: I do not intend to move amendment No. 198, which would delete clause 51(3) and under which we could have dealt with some general matters. We shall confine ourselves to the specifics of the amendments in this group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall speak to amendments Nos. 179, 231 and 289, which are crucial. My hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) has pointed out that there is an error—probably a misprint—in amendment No. 289. Instead of "line 7", it should read "line 11". I apologise to the Committee if my handwritten draft is responsible for the error. If it was introduced further down the process in the editing or printing stages, that is something that is almost bound to happen. I must say that the papers have been produced admirably accurately and on time, given the complexity of these matters and the pace at which we have been moving in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>830</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Hugh Bayley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his clarification. It is obvious that the amendment should read "line 11". When I marked my copy of the Bill, I put the proposed new paragraph (aa) at line 11. It could have been put in at either place, so it need not change the flow of the hon. Gentleman's argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary is extremely kind and gallant. I appreciate his remarks and am sorry if I have caused him to spend even a moment longer on his homework on the clause than he would otherwise have done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must make two general points about the Government's proposal to make sense of the amendment. Money will be reclaimed in two ways. Clause 51 changes the contribution rules, or the qualification rules, to filter out a greater number of people who qualify for incapacity benefit at present. Clause 52 will extend means-testing to incapacity benefit. To qualify for incapacity benefit, there are two contribution rules: first, if one has made a year's contribution to national insurance, and secondly, if in the past two benefit years, one has either paid or been credited with contributions. The Government want to change that, so that claimants will qualify only if they have made contributions—not been credited with them—in the past two years. The second criterion will continue to apply, which is rather strange, so that contributions or credits must have been made in both of the past two years. It might have been more straightforward and rather more honest—certainly more helpful—if, instead of continuing to have two contribution rules, the Government said that there is only one contribution rule: a claimant must have credits or contributions in the past two years, but contributions must have been made in one of those years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could not explain my amendment without making those remarks first, for reasons that the Committee will now appreciate. What is the difference between the two current contribution rules and the two new ones? Who will be filtered out by the new rules, but would have been admitted by the original rules? The amendments are intended to allow us to consider the categories of people who would pass today's contribution rules, but who will fail them if the Government get their way in the clause. They have said that, in addition to the filtering out exercise, they will take reserved powers by regulation under subsections (3) and (4) to enable them to make derogations in favour of one or two categories of claimants who are specified in the explanatory memorandum. Today, certain categories of people will pass the contribution test. Tomorrow—if the Government have their way—people will fail the test, yet there is the provision for the Government to use regulations to put some of the second category of people back into the first category and enable them to pass the test after all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The explanatory memorandum makes it clear that two categories of people will benefit from the Government's apparent generosity or mercy and will be allowed back even though they will fail the Government's new criteria.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0926">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>831</span>
The categories are those who are in receipt of invalid care allowance for caring for a disabled person and, secondly, as set out on page 93 of the explanatory notes, those who were in receipt of invalidity benefit
	<br><blockquote><p>"in the tax year before a new claim; without this protection, they may be unable to re-qualify for benefit after short breaks in entitlement."</p></blockquote>
We are grateful for that degree of largesse in respect of those two categories. The Government have mitigated the impact of their new criteria in respect of those two defined groups. They do not go beyond those groups, however, and it is our contention that other equally deserving cases should not be filtered out in such a way. Given that we debate amendments before clause stand part and we set much store at having the chance to debate the clause and to vote against it, we must proceed on the assumption that the Government will get the clause. I hope that that will not be justified, however, because we do not want such changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall try, therefore, to reduce the damage of the clause to protect certain groups that are eminently worthy of protection. Otherwise, they will be excluded from incapacity benefit and will not be protected by the two derogations that the Government intend to make under regulation. It goes without saying that they have chosen narrow, deserving groups for those special retrospective concessions, no doubt because the final implications of letting them back within the fold of incapacity benefit will not frustrate the Treasury's intention of clawing back the full £700 million to which I referred earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The groups that will be left out by the clause include those that any sane, let alone humane, person would have thought should not be excluded from incapacity benefit if he or she is disabled and has a record of contributions. Let us take the case of a mother who is looking after small children. She gave up work, looked after her children at least full time until they were five years old. She was out of the labour market for more than five years—depending on the age gap between the children, that might have been between five and 10 years. She has a record of contributions and has national insurance credits. The scheme was devised humanely by a coalition Government to make sure that the role of motherhood was recognised; its whole point was for people to receive credits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now the Labour Government are saying, "That is no good. We shall not honour credits. It is no use your saying that you contributed in the past and now have credits. That is not good enough. We are changing the rules. You must have made a contribution in one of the past two years." I saw you taking advice from the Clerk earlier, Mr. Malins; I hope that he thought that my reading out the rules was relevant to the amendment, otherwise my argument would make no sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That principle is inherent in the national insurance system. Indeed, national insurance started partly because it was recognised that motherhood is a good reason no longer to work; those who pay the contributions receive the credits. Through clause 51, the Government are subverting that system. I see that the Under-Secretary of State for Social Security has the honesty to nod his head.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Kali Mountford 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Colne Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall ask the hon.

Is it not the case that for credited contributions subsequently to qualify for the benefits that we are discussing, there must have been a qualifying period of paid contributions? Credits on their own have never qualified for those benefits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady repeats what I said. It was a good thing that I described the present contribution rules and contrasted them with the contribution rules proposed by the Government. However, it might have been better if I had done it three or four times, because the hon. Member for Colne Valley (Kali Mountford) clearly did not grasp the point on the first occasion. I shall tell the hon. Lady again, in case she does not know. The present rules make it clear that no one qualifies for incapacity benefit without a record of contributions. I agree with that. All Opposition Members believe in the contributory principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present rules state that, regardless of how many credits one has, one must have paid one year's contributions. One must have been working for at least a year. One does not receive credits unless one has made some contribution. It does not matter that that statement has an element of tautology. Everyone must have a direct relationship with the national insurance system and have contributed for at least one year. One can qualify for incapacity benefit or other contributory benefits only if one continues to pay contributions or if one has credits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Society has always recognised that certain activities should be given the same status as paid employment, because those activities are as valuable or more valuable to society, but that will not be recognised in new Labour Britain once the Bill is enacted. One of those activities is looking after small children. We therefore have the principle of national insurance credits, under which mothers who have given up work—rightly in many cases—to look after small children—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a powerful point with customary passion. It goes to the heart of new Labour values that earlier in the Bill we discovered that young mothers with pre-school age children who dump their child-rearing on the state by getting state-funded child care—in some cases, it is very expensive state-funded child care—and who subsequently want to claim benefit will be eligible for it, but that those who decide to do the rearing themselves, should they be unfortunate enough to need benefit, will find that they do not qualify for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend and I may differ slightly on the nuances; I think that, in many circumstances, it is entirely responsible, reasonable and not at all psychologically damaging for children if their mothers either go out to work or return to work rather earlier than he would think ideal. It is important that people are allowed to make their own choices. Most people love their children—they are their major priority.

I shall take interventions from Labour Members in order in just a moment, but first I shall deal with the important point made by my hon. Friend. He and I would agree that it is wrong for the Government to bias people against looking after their own children, pushing them in the direction of returning to work prematurely in the eyes of the mother or the parent with care. That is bad enough, but the new Labour Government are, as I have
	<span class='label label-info column'>834</span>
said, not pushing those people; they are using crude economic sanctions to force that choice on vulnerable people.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Kali Mountford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The national insurance principle always linked the benefits accrued from the national insurance paid to the benefit for which it was paid. For example, in the case of unemployment benefit, the national insurance had to be paid in the relevant income tax year. To keep that principle of connecting the benefit to the contribution, is it not right to look more closely at the qualifying period of paid contributions? Credits on their own without any period of paid contribution have never qualified people for unemployment or incapacity benefit. Is that not correct?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it is not. The hon. Lady is making the same mistake as the Under-Secretary. I have made it absolutely clear that the present system is one under which—and rightly so—credits alone will not qualify people for incapacity benefit. I think that that is the origin of the misunderstanding. I said that clearly when I set out the existing two contributions. To qualify, it is necessary that a claimant should have a year of actual contributions. I do not know whether the Under-Secretary thinks that I am unhappy with that. I am not. Today, there is a direct link between contributions and incapacity benefit. Anyone who wants to qualify for incapacity benefit must have credits over the past two years and a year of actual contributions. I am not seeking to change that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Lady said, there must be a link to the system involving not merely credits, but contributions. Indeed, a person would not qualify for credits unless he or she had made contributions. There is an element of tautology in the present rules. I am not seeking to change them. The Government are seeking to do that and to produce a system whereby only people who have a contribution record in one year out of the past two will qualify. The clause refers to a full year of contributions and anyone whose contribution record stopped more than 13 months ago would no longer receive incapacity benefit.

Before I was subjected to a systematic attempt to push me off my course, I was going through the most deserving categories of people who would be excluded from incapacity benefit as a result of the change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I have never argued, in any forum or speech, as Labour Members have frequently tried to suggest, that women with small children should stay at home. My wife worked part-time when we had small children. The fact remains that many women would like the choice of being able to stay at home. There is another important category—those for whom the only form of work available involves hours that are incompatible with child rearing. The Bill is providing taxpayer-funded child care for those mothers who choose to go out to work, with no balancing corrections. Ladies who apply for incapacity benefit will find that they are again disadvantaged. They will be unable to get it, whereas people who are subsided by the taxpayer for child care will be eligible. That is one more example of the system being biased against people who opt to look after small children or disabled relatives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If I can draw the hon. Gentleman's attention from the interesting reading matter that he has in front of him, will he comment on the difference between amendments Nos. 140 and 197? Does he agree that amendment No. 140 would tend to include parents who have taken the opportunity to look after their own children at home, whereas amendment No. 197 would tend to exclude them? The hon. Gentleman might care to think about supporting amendment No. 140 in preference to amendment No. 197.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I noticed that the Liberal Democrats had been rather more generous than us and I accept that their amendment would protect a wider range of people. I am happy to support it and to urge my hon. Friends to do so if it is put to the vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A matter that is not entirely germane to my amendments has been raised. I think the phrase was that I had got my facts wrong. It is parliamentary custom that if one is so accused, one is allowed to justify one's remarks and set the record straight. My hon. Friends have found in this extremely helpful and authoritative book the two sentences that set out the rules for obtaining credits. They are the same rules that I referred to earlier, so I have already used the material.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is plenty of evidence that the Government want to talk about anything under the sun, except what they are doing to incapacity benefit. They want to think about
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0929">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>837</span>
everybody under the sun, rather than the people who will be excluded invidiously from incapacity benefit. We cannot let the Government do that. We will force the Committee to focus on the groups of people who will be deliberately excluded from incapacity benefit under the Government's proposals. The people who have worked and contributed to national insurance in the past and who currently qualify will now be told, "If you become disabled, you will not qualify for this benefit. All you get are means-tested benefits.".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government want to throw everyone who currently receives a contributory benefit on to means-tested benefits. We know that that is part of their grand strategy. It is important for the Committee to focus on, and think carefully about, some human examples. What about mothers who give up work to look after their children? I must be repetitive, because the Government do not even recognise the facts of history: until now, the national insurance system has recognised that mothers who look after their children are as valuable and precious to society as people who work, and are equally deserving of national insurance contributory benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the past 60 years, we have had a system of national insurance credits. Perhaps I should explain to the new Labour party that national insurance credits represent a right to national insurance contributory benefits even if the claimant has not paid national insurance contributions or if his or her employer has not paid contributions for class 1 employed persons. National insurance credits are notional entitlements—they could be described as warrants—that are provided by society in recognition of the fact that the role of mothers looking after small children is equivalent to, or even greater in value than, that of those who work. It would be unreasonable to exclude them from any contributory benefits for which they would otherwise qualify—for example, incapacity benefit under the all-work test, which is to be replaced with the personal capability assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government do not believe that mothers should qualify. The Opposition believe that they should. People who look after their small children have a back-breaking task, which must be done properly, consistently and every day, including Saturdays and Sundays, and sometimes in the middle of the night if a child is ill. We have always valued that and the consensus in this country has been to give that occupation at least the same value as paid work. Amendment No. 289 specifically recognises that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other categories of people will be excluded from incapacity benefit under the Bill, and the purpose of the amendments is to include those also. We shall vote against the clause because we do not want it in the Bill, but if we must have it, we want to mitigate its effects by protecting specific categories of people beyond the two small groups that the Government say they will protect by way of regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One group covers those who were employed until recently before, or perhaps until, they became disabled or applied for incapacity benefit, but whose earnings were below the lower limit. It has always been a feature of the national insurance system that if earnings are below the lower earnings limit for contributions, they do not qualify for benefits. That has always been the case and it is harsh on someone with a low-paid job, but I am not seeking to
	<span class='label label-info column'>838</span>
complain about that now. I do not seek to rewrite that measure. However, under the present system—the details of which I do not need to repeat a third time—if someone who earned above the lower earnings threshold, and therefore paid contributions, subsequently falls below that threshold, he or she is still protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is particularly relevant in the case of the disabled because many disabling conditions are progressive—perhaps regressive is a more appropriate term; people's health and faculties gradually decline. So what will happen under the Government's proposals? If someone finds that he or she can no longer work full time or earn the same salary, he must do something else; the Government are saying that anyone who can work must do so, that they are going to push people out the door. All the provisions in the Bill are designed to do that. What will be the effect on incapacity benefit? The Government are sending a signal to disabled applicants that if they have an up-to-date contributions record for one complete year of the previous two, they will receive incapacity benefit. However, if they have allowed their earnings to fall below the lower earnings limit, they will not qualify because they do not have that full contribution record. Credits in such cases will be disregarded. One must have a complete year of contributions; nothing that happened two years or more ago will be recognised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said—Labour Members did not contradict it—if one's earnings, even as recently as 13 months previously, fell below the lower earnings threshold and one ceased to contribute, one is done for—one has lost all entitlement. One might have had 20 to 30 years before that of paying constant contributions to national insurance, year in, year out, because one has had a full employment record—and one has lost the lot. One is told by the new Labour Government, "Ha, ha! You've lost it—we've got your contributions in our pockets and we are not going to pay you the benefit now, no matter how badly you are disabled." That is the new Labour Government and that is what will happen under the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should be sympathetic and supportive of someone who finds that his or her capacities, faculties and energies are failing but who hangs on in his or her job, perhaps hoping that things will get better; that is a reasonable, sensible and responsible—and, in many cases, optimistic—line to take. We do not want to discourage people or to clobber them in the way that the Government propose. Amendment No. 289 would protect people, providing for regulations to be made for
	<br><blockquote><p>"the contribution conditions to be deemed to be satisfied in the case of persons who in any complete twelve month period in the course of the two years before becoming disabled had been credited with contributions of a relevant class…or who had over such a period been regularly employed on a level of earnings below the Lower Earnings Limit."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is something unreal about our debate, which will be clear when 	<i>Hansard</i> is published. I say something, after which an Opposition Member asks me to recognise exactly what I have just said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have always recognised the fact to which the hon. Member for Colne Valley alluded and I asked my hon. Friends to correct me if I was under an illusion. I explicitly stated that I accept that if a person's lifetime earnings are below the lower earnings limit, he will not qualify for national insurance benefits, although I appreciate that that can be harsh. I am beginning to repeat myself, but I have to do so. The hon. Lady does not—or affects not to—take on board what I say the first time that I say it. It would be peculiar if I did not endorse her comments, because she asked me to agree with something that I had said five minutes earlier. She is right about the lower earnings limit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I can remove the source of the hon. Lady's genuine confusion by making it clear that, in relation to the categories that are contained in amendment No. 289, one need not have benefits from credits or notional entitlement—I used the word "deemed"—if one has a record of five years' actual contributions. Perhaps she did not read to the end of amendment No. 289 and it might be helpful if I read it out for her.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"provided that any such person had actually paid contributions of a relevant class for at least five complete years."</p></blockquote>
It should be clear by now to the hon. Member for Colne Valley that we believe that to qualify for national insurance benefits one must have maintained payment for five years, which is a stricter requirement than that which currently applies. I suspect that the hon. Lady will vote for extremely restrictive clauses that will limit people's right to incapacity benefit, compared with their present
	<span class='label label-info column'>840</span>
entitlement, and that she is happy with any proposal that restricts rather than entitles. That is the new Labour Government's stance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 289 mentions several categories. I have already discussed mothers—Labour Members maintained an embarrassed silence or made irrelevant interventions when I did so—and the lower earnings limit. [	<i>Interruption.]</i> The Minister of State will have many opportunities to advance his own arguments and he can intervene now if he wants to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 289 would also protect people who have been
	<br><blockquote><p>"engaged full time over such a period in caring for a disabled person".</p></blockquote>
The arguments that were relevant to mothers are also relevant in this context. Although it was not part of the original Beveridge corpus, we have come to recognise that caring for a disabled person is as valuable a task socially as going out to paid employment. If a person cares for a relative, close friend, spouse or partner, the state is in a sense relieved of the need to provide care for the person who can no longer look after himself or herself. Asking whether the state wishes to encourage such displays of family solidarity goes to the heart of the matter. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury also has strong views on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People with caring responsibilities, who have a contributions record and who gave up paid work to care, should not be cruelly told if they, too, become disabled that they will be cheated of the national insurance premium that they paid over many years. But that would be the effect of the Government's proposal, except in relation to carers who are in receipt of invalidity care allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten) was right to make the point that not all carers qualify for ICA. This is another Government sleight of hand, There may be good reasons why people do not qualify for ICA. Some carers may not have even applied for it. Why should people be denied their entitlement to a contributory benefit because they have been good enough not to claim another benefit to which they might have been entitled? Many people deliberately do not claim the benefits to which they are entitled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another reason for not claiming ICA is the condition that the carer—the Minister of State will correct me if I am wrong—must be formally resident in the same place as the person for whom he or she cares. The carer may live next door or down the street, or we have a good reason to retain a house or flat of his or her own. That would exclude the carer from claiming ICA even if he was engaged full time in looking after a disabled person. If the Government are sincere in their intention to protect carers, they should say so; they should not limit protection to carers who receive ICA. Our proposal would protect all carers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendments would protect another group that deserves our sympathy, not our rejection. Some people who become disabled while unemployed have a contributions record. The new Labour Government have little sympathy for the unemployed. I accept that some people may be shirkers and are reluctant to get back into
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0931">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>841</span>
the job market. They are the non-deserving unemployed. That is why we approved the Government's attempt to strengthen the jobseeker's allowance, which we introduced, through work-focused interviews and other measures that provide a necessary element of discipline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us assume that shirkers who are trying to sponge off the state—I suspect that their number is not as great as the Government believe—will be filtered out by the new processes and disciplines. That leaves us with the genuine unemployed. All hon. Members know from their constituency experience how difficult it is for people who have been made redundant, through no fault of their own, to get back into the job market. It is especially difficult if they are over 40 or 50 or, in some cases, even 30 or 35. It is pathetic. We all know of people who have made hundreds of job applications in a desperate attempt to get work. The Government will cut off those people, who are earning credits, from the right to claim incapacity benefit because they are temporarily unemployed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take it that the memory of Labour Members is not so short term that, after five or 10 minutes, we have to repeat everything because they have forgotten it, so I shall not rehearse the argument on credits. Under the rules, an unemployed person with a record of one full year's contributions over a two-year period receives the credits. If that person becomes disabled during those two years, he or she is eligible for incapacity benefit. Under the Government's proposals, someone who, through no fault of his or her own, is unemployed at the relevant time when disaster strikes—be it an accident, disease or whatever—will find that he or she no longer qualifies. That is brutally inhumane. The amendment would reverse that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have set out what we are trying to achieve but, I repeat, we do not really want to accept any of the amendments, although we shall, of course, vote for them when we are given the opportunity to do so. We want to remove the clause from the Bill because it represents an entirely unjustified emasculation of an important part of our national insurance system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are trying to save money by excluding from the opportunity to receive incapacity benefit a range of people who, under present rules, are fully entitled and have always been entitled to incapacity benefit. Those people are thoroughly justified in believing that they have been paying national insurance contributions partially to insure themselves against a particular disaster in life, which incapacity, whether indefinite or medium term—for more than six months—inevitably means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In respect of many conditions, even when people manage to recover somewhat, they will never be the same again. Therefore, we are talking about very vulnerable people. The Government are attempting to extract a lot of money from such people in future because they are not afraid to short change those who have been contributing to the national insurance system in good faith.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are plumbing the depths of cynicism in these proposals, which do not deserve the slightest sympathy or support from anyone in the House because they are contrary to the principles that have guided our social legislation and social policy in the House of Commons throughout the century.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>842</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Much of our debate so far has been an interesting one relating to whether clause 51 strengthens or weakens the contribution principle. In the process, we have had a valuable debate about the contribution principle itself. Members of the Social Security Select Committee, many of whom are also members of the Standing Committee, will have an opportunity to pursue that debate further in the months ahead. It is an important debate because, in recent years, there has been a considerable weakening of the contribution principle; the link between contributions and entitlements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, under the previous Government national insurance rates were increased by 50 per cent. during a time when benefits were substantially cut. That included the £10 billion that was taken from the pension system by cutting the link with earnings and the reduction in state earnings-related pension scheme entitlement. Some £3 billion was taken from the unemployed when the entitlement to contributions-based unemployment benefit was halved with the introduction of jobseeker's allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford used the term cynicism, which is quite inappropriate to describe what the Government are trying to do. However, in relation to incapacity benefit, it is important to reflect that, in recent years under the previous Government, there was a cynical attempt to get people off the unemployment register and on to incapacity benefit as a mechanism for getting the unemployment figures down. That meant that many people, particularly the older unemployed, were written off. They were told that they were sick and would never work again, that jobs could not be found for them and that no assistance would be given to help them to find work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a very different approach. The Government are not willing to write people off, but are saying that they will assist people into employment if they have the opportunity to do so. That is one of the purposes of the new deal for older unemployed people. The clause helps to strengthen the link between contributions and benefit entitlement, because it ensures that incapacity benefit is a work-based benefit, as it was always intended to be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot support the amendments and I support clause 51 as it stands. There is a provision that the contribution conditions will be based on a multiple of the lower earnings limit, which means that the number of weeks that a person will have to work to meet those contribution conditions will vary. Ministers know that I have a particular concern for people in low-paid work. Those who are ill or disabled are often more likely to be in low-paid employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to press Ministers to consider the number of weeks that people on, for example, the minimum wage will have to work to fulfil those contribution conditions.

I cannot compete with the immense passion and depth of knowledge of my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford, so I shall make four narrow points on the amendments, which you have wisely grouped together, Mr. Malins.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measure is designed to cut the number of people who can receive incapacity benefit, but the amendments would widen that pattern. We were fortunate to hear a contribution from the hon. Member for High Peak (Mr. Levitt), who said that many unemployed people received incapacity benefit. The hon. Member for Gravesham suggested that there was a conspiracy. I think that the suggestion would have been worthy of the great American film director, Oliver Stone. It was suggested that, under the previous Government, messages from Downing Street filtered through to the Benefits Agency and that those who did not qualify for incapacity benefit were pushed on to it to reduce the number of people on unemployment benefit. Clearly, that is absurd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the experts say that the Government's proposals will reduce the number of people on incapacity benefit by about 170,000—so 170,000 people who would have qualified for incapacity benefit will no longer be able to rely on it. They will have to apply for means-tested benefits. If their wives or husbands work, or if they do not qualify for means-tested benefits, they will receive nothing, as the citizens advice bureaux brief states. The state will abandon them. Their standard of living will drop, regardless of their contributions, until their savings are eaten away and they qualify for means-tested benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government suggest that no efficient link exists between employment and the benefit, or that it is tenuous. They say that those who are unemployed should not qualify for the benefit. In an excellent brief, the citizens advice bureaux state that it is quite likely that many of those people who become unemployed while off sick will be in receipt of statutory sick pay and that many sick workers will be dismissed early because of their period of illness. The citizens advice bureaux make another good point: those who become incapacitated while unemployed, especially those suffering from mental health problems, will be peculiarly disadvantaged under the clause. The amendments would ameliorate those effects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford did not mention the fact that the clause is likely to have a perverse effect in that it will act as a disincentive for those on incapacity benefit to seek work if they are ill or disabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Chatham and Aylesford referred to the 52-week period. I remember the statutory instrument by which that period was introduced, and we
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0933">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>845</span>
welcomed it. The hon. Gentleman is not in his place, but perhaps Labour Members will mention the point to him, so that he can respond to it later. With respect to him, what he said about the 52-week period misses the point in so far as any period of unemployment will affect a person's ability to claim incapacity benefit. Rather than strengthen the link to work, the provision will act as a disincentive to people to go into work. The Royal National Institute for the Blind said that it would have the perverse effect of someone who had been unemployed for two years, but who had worked for 10 years, not being able to qualify, but someone who had worked two years and was unemployed for 10 years being able to qualify.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision will break the link with the contribution. The contributions of people who had assumed that the state would look after them, or make a contribution if they were incapacitated because they made contributions over a lengthy period, will be cast asunder. The Government are not right in general, but if they are right that certain people are claiming incapacity benefit inappropriately, surely the way to solve that will be not to restrict a person's qualifications and reduce the level at which his or her contributions can be taken into consideration, but to use the gateway to benefits, such as the all-work test or the personal capacity test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers have spoken at great length about how important it is to ensure that claims are correct, are put in the proper order and that fraudulent or inappropriate claims are stopped at the point at which they are submitted. Why not apply that test to all-work or personal incapacity tests? After all, we know from last week's debates that there is no difference in the medical assessments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee have been fortunate in receiving a high level of briefing. The Disability Benefits Consortium said that it was unacceptable to deny benefits to thousands of genuine claimants on the basis that some may be getting benefits to which they are not entitled. The consortium's briefing also contains an interesting example that has not been mentioned. It illustrates how the clause will operate and concerns a gentleman called Jack, who was a miner in south Yorkshire. It is good of the consortium to lobby on behalf of miners. There was a time when they were considered folk heroes by the Labour party, which would have done anything to help the National Union of Mineworkers. The gentleman had worked down the pit for 30 years since the age of 16. He was made redundant at the age of 46. The consortium continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"At first he was hopeful of finding alternative work and made strenuous efforts to do so for three years. As time went on he became increasingly depressed and was finally admitted to hospital with serious depression following a suicide attempt."</p></blockquote>
Under the current system, Jack would have been able to apply for incapacity benefit following his discharge from hospital. Under the Government's proposal, Jack would be excluded from benefit because he had not worked for the past two years, despite having worked hard for the previous 30 years. He would have to rely instead on means-tested benefit. That is what the amendments would ameliorate and change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford was courageous when he said that he did not
	<span class='label label-info column'>846</span>
like any of our amendments, or even those tabled by the Liberal Democrats—I suspect that in their hearts, the Liberal Democrats do not like their amendments. We should prefer not to have to table them, but given that the Government are determined to push their proposals through, we are trying to guide them away from their own folly. It is not them who will suffer—I sincerely hope that all hon. Members will enjoy good health—but the 170,000 people who could otherwise claim incapacity benefit who will now be abandoned by the state.

Another statement from the Disability Benefits Consortium was so striking that it caught the eye of the person who put together the research document on this Bill. In commenting on the clause, page 73 of that document states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This makes a mockery of the Government's promises not to harm the genuinely disabled."</p></blockquote>
I can think of no better way to end my speech because that sums up the dilemma. I hope that the Government will think long and hard about their proposals. It is about time that they started accepting Opposition amendments, which would improve the Bill and bring about the Government's original intentions. The clause makes a mockery of the Government's original statements of intent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Levitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was tempted to intervene so many times in the speech of the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar, but I thought that it would be more courteous to him and the Committee if I were to make my comments all at once afterwards. I was stimulated by his remark that under the Government's proposals, unemployed people cannot qualify for incapacity benefit. That is incorrect and it is not what the Bill says.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Levitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I heard the hon. Gentleman say those words. We shall check 	<i>Hansard</i> tomorrow to find out whether my hearing or his memory is at fault.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two-year qualification period covers two tax or contribution years, but it could be nearer three years if it were close to the end of the third year, say in March, when someone made a claim for incapacity benefit. The person could have been out of touch with the labour market for almost three years before making a claim, but he would still qualify. He need have worked for only four weeks in that period. If he was on average male earnings, he would have reached the contribution threshold nearly three years ago on the basis of only four weeks' work. In any case, it would be a maximum of only 25 weeks' work. Within that three-year period, the person would not only have access, through the new deal for disabled people, to assistance on appropriate work, but extra help would be triggered by the fact that he had been out of work for two years or more, provided that he was seeking employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar talked about the previous system and the allegations about whether it was a true representation of the situation. He should answer the question that I put to one of his
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0934">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>847</span>
hon. Friend's in an earlier sitting. Does he believe that one quarter of all males between the ages of 60 and 65 are incapable of any work whatsoever? That is what the present incapacity benefit statistics would lead us to believe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rendel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in that point. It seems to be directly contrary to what the Government were saying last week, which was that they do not believe that those who are receiving incapacity benefit under the current rules are in any way cheating the system or that the new test is stricter or will cut out anyone who is currently eligible; they believe that the tests are being fairly and properly carried out. That is exactly contrary to the point that the hon. Gentleman just made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Levitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not suggesting that any of those people are claiming improperly, but a quarter of 60 to 65-year-old unemployed males receive incapacity benefit. That proportion is double what it was 20 years ago. I cannot believe that the health of our nation is twice as bad as it was 20 years ago. A large number of those people are capable of some work and not, as the statistics would lead us to believe, incapable of any work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Far from departing from the contributory principle, the Bill introduces elements to it, such as the measure that disabled people will, under the stakeholder pension scheme, get credits towards their pensions through periods of economic inactivity when their earnings are under £9,000—they may not have any earnings at all. That is an extension of that contributory principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rendel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's argument now appears to be that people who are capable of getting back to work are cut out by the new regulations. What evidence has he that the 170,000 people who will lose their eligibility to incapacity benefit are those who could go back to work and that those who will not lose eligibility could not go back to work?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Levitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No one who is claiming will lose the right to any of the benefit that he or she is receiving. A package of benefits—the disability income guarantee, the disability living allowance and the increased premium on disability for income support—exists to give appropriate cover for all those people in all those circumstances. We may end up with a quarter of people aged 60 to 65 still qualifying for incapacity benefit; the important point is that if people in work become disabled, they are given maximum assistance to stay in work and that if they lose that work, they are given maximum assistance to get back into work if they are capable of doing so. Where they are genuinely incapable of work and not seeking work because of that incapacity, their dignity will be maintained through a proper standard of living.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gainsborough)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting debate. After the marvellous tour de force of my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford, which was a classic Committee speech, there is little to be said. Given his past record, his passion on the matter
	<span class='label label-info column'>848</span>
is genuine. There is no point in repeating the many fine points that he and my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar made and I shall take a slightly different direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that I want to follow is how we are to reform incapacity benefit—because it must be reformed. Are the Government reforming it in the right way, should we leave it alone or should we reform it in the way proposed by the two principal amendments tabled by the Liberal Democrats and by my hon. Friend? To pick up the point made earlier, by May 1998 1.6 million people—7 per cent. of the population—received incapacity benefit, which was three time more than when the Government came into power. If the Conservative Government had won the election, they would have radically reformed incapacity benefit. The Government's proposal is not the right way to reform it, because they announced ahead of time that they hope to save £700 million by such reforms. I have no idea how much less money would be saved by the Government if the amendments were passed, but one reason why those who look after the interests of disabled people took a dim view of the clause is that the Government said that they intend to save £700 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why the Disability Benefits Consortium said that people who have an extensive work record, albeit in the past, and who become unemployed might not even be covered by the amendments. It said that, under the changes, some people with a previous extensive work record who are unemployed before becoming disabled would not be entitled to incapacity benefit. Many will have paid contributions for many years on the understanding that if, in the future, they become incapacitated they would be entitled to benefit. Those who look after the rights of disabled people are making a fair point. It is not good enough for the Government to say, "We must do something. Clearly, incapacity benefit is being misused. The numbers receiving it have increased threefold; it is just being used as a replacement for unemployment benefit."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those may be valuable points, but the Government must take on board some of the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford. I do not know what the solution is. Is it to do nothing? Is it to say, "Well, if you worked for two years or for some time during the past 10 years paying your contribution, you will not fall foul of the clause"? I am not convinced that what the Government are doing is right nor am I convinced that what is proposed under the amendments is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments have been tabled to generate a debate. I accept that, but some time in our proceedings, on Report or in the Select Committee on Social Security, we must seriously debate what incapacity benefit is for and how it should be reformed. Something is very wrong with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oaten</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making some important points. However, it might have made more sense to have waited for the Government's other initiatives on getting disabled people back to work, such as the new deal or other pilot schemes—some of which I doubt will ever run nationally—to be bedded in and see how effective they were before making the changes to incapacity benefit. Select Committees, such as that of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0935">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>849</span>
which the hon. Member for Gainsborough is a member, could make valued judgments about whether the safety net of the new job measures in place was enough to make the changes to incapacity benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair intervention and I accept it completely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If someone has contributed all his life and becomes incapacitated, as happens naturally to many people under the aging process, should that person's incapacity benefit be removed simply because he made provision for a personal or occupational benefit? If that person receives an occupational pension of, say, £179 a week, he would lose his incapacity benefit. That is another philosophical question that I do not have the expertise or knowledge to answer. I do not know what the answer is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can the Government argue that people who have provided for a personal or occupational pension should lose incapacity benefit? Surely that is an unarguable proposition. We are not talking about people who receive a large occupational or personal pension—£179 per week is not a fortune. If the clause is agreed to unamended, such people will lose incapacity benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As has been said, often people do not become suddenly incapacitated and there may be a period of gradual decline. It is unfair that people who have worked all their life but have not managed to sustain their contributions in the previous two years will be hit by the Government's proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause, if unamended, will be fundamentally unjust. Something must be done about incapacity benefit, however, and to that extent I support the Government. I am not making a party political speech. Incapacity benefit is not working and has been abused.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes an important point. The critical point that he made a moment ago relates to the next clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would the hon. Gentleman agree that an important part of the problem that he rightly identifies with incapacity benefit, is that someone who has been unemployed for a long time has a big incentive to become sick to graduate on to incapacity benefit? Would he agree that the system should not work in that way? It should provide encouragement to those who are capable of doing so to move back into work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. There should be no incentive to become sick. The Minister makes a fair point. I do not accept the proposition that those who have made provision should be denied a state benefit, or that those who have not maintained their contributions in the previous two years should be denied a state benefit, but I do accept that something is badly wrong with the benefit. The hon. Member for High Peak made a relevant point in that regard. Surely the country has not become three times more sick in the past 18 years. Labour Members may say that the Conservative Government made them feel sick, but I am sure that they did not become more physically sick.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>850</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Jacqui Lait 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Beckenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While I do not disagree with my hon. Friend's remarks, I hope that he will take into account the fact that the national health service has become cleverer at helping people to survive. As a result, the number of people with genuine long-term illnesses—who would previously have died—has increased.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point. More research on that matter is necessary. It is almost a feature of this debate that we assume that many people in their 50s, especially in the public sector, suddenly announce that they have a bad back and take the system for a ride. That may or may not be true—there is always an element of truth in such arguments. Equally, there is an element of truth in what my hon. Friend says.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only way through this morass is a better form of medical. That is also what the Government are trying to achieve, but I do not know whether their objectives will be met. Many illnesses and incapacitating conditions, such as a bad back, are difficult to diagnose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oaten</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the logic, but the Minister told us last week that he did not expect the change in the test to result in different individuals receiving benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a good point, which was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar in his speech. If the Government are not trying to take out of the system those who are using incapacity benefit as a replacement for unemployment benefit—and if they do not assume that a better medical will take people out of the system—the inescapable conclusion is that the proposal is Treasury driven and that the Government are simply trying to save money. They are using a sledgehammer to crack a very large nut, but they have got the wrong sledgehammer and they are wielding it in the wrong way. It is the many people, who have, through no fault of their own, become incapacitated, and who will fall foul of the clause's provisions, who will suffer, and that cannot be right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish that I had a conclusion and that I could tell the Minister what to do, but, on this occasion, I cannot—I have only made what might be called a think speech. I had better resume my seat, in the hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Mr. Flight) can help us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flight</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford made some of the points that I wanted to make. I cannot believe that in their hearts Labour Members support the clause. It is immoral for several reasons, and the Chancellor's bullying lies behind it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My first objection is that this is a devious piece of legislation and that the explanatory notes are a disgrace. The only example that they give of the clause's impact is that of a young person who qualifies for incapacity benefit and who was previously excluded. They make no attempt to describe the category of people who will suffer as a result of changes to the contribution qualifications. I support the amendments that were moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh), and the Liberal Democrat amendments, which go slightly further, although they are not the full answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0936">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>851</span>
In principle, IB is one of the strongest qualifiers for being a universal benefit. When it is properly implemented, it acknowledges the fact that if one is incapacitated, one's costs of living automatically rise. One needs additional aids and one's transportation costs rise. It is the classic case in which the welfare state's original, universal principles are appropriate. On a preference list it should not involve means testing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends argued that the objection to the Government's position is that rip-offs occur and that too many older people qualify for IB. The solution must involve tightening up medical qualifications. The Government cannot have it both ways. They cannot argue that they will not change the terms under which people will qualify for IB on medical grounds and propose to change the relevant new medical arrangements. If the clause is designed to resolve that problem, it does not do so, and the Government are ducking the issue by saying, "Oh no, that problem does not exist."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some people who have paid contributions throughout their lives may suffer from progressive diseases. They may keep working for as long as possible, although during the year or two before they are no longer capable of work they may fall below the new short-term contribution levels. My hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford endeavoured to cite the categories of people who may be affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be helpful if Ministers explained where they believe the saving of £700 million will come from. Which people with which incapacities will no longer qualify? In this sensitive area, it is time for transparency. What I dislike about the clause is that it is devious, immoral and not transparent; it does not advertise what it wants to achieve or make clear whom it will affect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would prevent those people who will be unjustly impacted by the measures from suffering. I know that the Government will not accept the amendments but, if the real objective of the clause is to cut out fraud and remove the ramps that are associated with incapacity benefit, they should return to the drawing board and redraft it. I cannot believe that they support the injustices that the clause will create.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rendel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a few points to make. First, amendment No. 140 is important because it refers to two years in the last 10. As I said in my intervention, the people affected are likely to include a large number of those who have had caring responsibilities for pre-school children. In a typical case, a mother may decide to take time off work after being in employment for some time to look after her children. In the case of the average family, that will probably be five, six, seven, or maybe eight years. She will then try to get back into work. If, however, for one reason or another, she becomes incapable of work and eligible for incapacity benefit, it is reasonable that she should be able to receive incapacity benefit at that time. The amendment, by stipulating two years in the last 10, would cover those people and others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point concerns people who have a progressive disease. Several Conservative Members referred to progressive diseases, but no one mentioned the
	<span class='label label-info column'>852</span>
fact that the Government's proposals will give people who have such a disease a clear incentive to leave work and get on to incapacity benefit as quickly as possible. That will even be the case for people who have a progressive disease that allows them to remain in full-time or part-time work for a short time, because it will be in their favour to qualify for incapacity benefit within the period during which they have made the relevant contributions. That is contrary to the Government's aim of helping people with an incapacitating disease to remain in work for as long as possible and to return to it if they recover. People will be forced out of work at the earliest possible moment so that they remain eligible for incapacity benefit. The Government have not told us that that is their aim, so the proposal is illogical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third point relates to the Government's contention that the previous Government attempted to get people off the unemployment register in a phoney way by putting them on incapacity benefit. How many of the 170,000 people whom they expect to be ineligible for incapacity benefit will go on to the unemployment register? Do they expect an increase in unemployment? As many people who will be ineligible for incapacity benefit will also be ineligible for jobseeker's allowance, the unemployment register will not change much. I am worried about the Government's argument that they want people to be on the unemployment register instead of receiving incapacity benefit. Although I suspect that the Bill will not achieve that, I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a general point to be made about the aim of the amendments. The new restrictions seem to be an entirely arbitrary attempt to cut numbers. They do not seem to follow logically from the Government's professed aims. For example, the Government might say, "We want to take out of the incapacity benefit system those who are not incapable." That would be a logical way forward because they might think that some people who receive incapacity benefit do not need or deserve it. However that is not what they said, which is why we pressed them so hard on the issue last week. They accepted that everyone who receives incapacity benefit is eligible for it and genuinely incapable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They said that their new tests would not exclude any of those people who were now eligible and that they did not think that the doctors who carried out the relevant tests were in any way cheating the system. The cut is not based on excluding people who are not really incapable, nor is it based on getting people back on to the unemployment register. If the Government were saying, "Many people who receive incapacity benefit are capable of working and should be on the unemployment register", they would not simply cut out those people who have not made recent contributions. That would be an illogical way of trying to get people back on to the unemployment register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Neither is the cut based on the level of contributions. One might think that if they were trying to be fair, the Government would find some way of giving incapacity benefit only to those people who have made contributions or done more in some way for the state or their families. However, the cut is not based on the level of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0937">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>853</span>
contributions. That might have been one way of doing it and some of the amendments are aimed at making the provision more fair, so that the greater one's contributions, the more chance one has of receiving incapacity benefit. Instead, the Government simply base the cut on whether people happen to have become incapacitated after a recent period of employment during which they made contributions. That is an entirely arbitrary decision. What is the logic behind giving incapacity benefit only to those who have most recently been in work?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timms</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman recognise that the purpose of incapacity benefit is as a replacement for earnings? That has always been its purpose and that is the logic behind the change that is being made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rendel</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I recognise that. I am not suggesting that incapacity benefit should be given to anyone who would not, at that time, be ready to go to work were he or she not incapacitated. That is earnings related and exactly in line with my thinking, but I do not think that that is a valid argument against the points that I have been making about the Government's aims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The questions should be, "Are you incapable of working and have you been making national insurance contributions?". If the answer to both questions is yes, that person should receive incapacity benefit. That is not what will happen if the Bill is approved in its current form. To sum up, the Government's policy in introducing the clause is "Work for those who can, but cuts for those who cannot."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall focus on two points. So many points have been made so well, both by my hon. Friends and by the Liberal Democrat spokesman, that I do not want to bore the Committee or you, Mr. Malins, by repeating them. I embrace in total the overarching remark of my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough that no one denies that there is a serious need for reform, but it should be medically based, not based on trying to catch people round the edges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My first point is a new one. If Ministers are unwilling to accept either the amendments relating to greater flexibility in relation to the time period that we proposed or the slightly more generous one proposed by the Liberal Democrats, will they say what the position will be for a small but deserving group of people—service wives—whose earnings track record is frequently affected by their husbands' being posted to Germany, or elsewhere? I should like to reassure the Committee that I am not using this as a gimmick, simply because there is a threat that substantial numbers of our armed forces may be at war within the next few weeks. I dealt with the sad case of a disabled service wife, who came on a delegation to see a Minister some years ago with the late Anne Armstrong, who herself died of a chronic illness after years of campaigning on behalf of the service wives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no provision in the Bill for service spouses—I shall call them that as there might, exceptionally, also be cases involving the husbands of service women. If the clause is not amended in the ways proposed by either the Liberal Democrats or
	<span class='label label-info column'>854</span>
ourselves, what would be the position of a service wife with a record of many years' continuous earning, who will invariably have to give up her paid employment if she is sent to Germany? Her position could also be difficult in terms of residence, even if she is paying full national insurance contributions working in a NAAFI, or some other demeaning form of employment, which is often the only form of work available, even to highly qualified service spouses. I look forward to the Ministers' response on that issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the point about mothers looking after children, and the parallel point about those who look after disabled people. I have two points—one a historical one, the other a personal one. The historical point is that the bulk of the original measures designed to look after the long-term chronically ill were introduced by a Conservative Government—the Heath Government. Since then, they have been through many changes of name and substance. I am still not clear as to the resolution of the dispute between the two Front Benches on the matter of fact. However, if my point were to break new ground, affecting relatively modest numbers of people, I make no apology for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point is personal and is addressed particularly to the hon. Member for Gravesham. In all the years under the previous Government that I drew attention to the bias against spouses—it is not always the woman, in some cases it is the man—who stay at home to look after children, no one raised any objection. However, it seems impossible for me to raise the point as an Opposition Member without at least one member of the new Labour model army leaping up to allege that I am proposing that mothers of small children should always stay at home. Nothing is further from the truth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will in a moment, but I want to finish my argument. I have never made any such suggestion and, in speaking to the amendments, I am not doing so now. My own wife continued to work part-time through our children's pre-school years and now that our third child has started school, she does two part-time jobs. However, not all mothers have the opportunity to do an attractive part-time job while their children are of pre-school age. Some are faced with either no opportunity to work, or an opportunity that is incompatible with what they regard as the duties of a mother, because it is a full-time job involving long hours. In the context of the amendments, this choice is especially sharp for disabled people or those with chronic illnesses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pond</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way and I appreciate that he has partially withdrawn the comments that he made earlier. However, if the hon. Gentleman looks at 	<i>Hansard</i> when it is published, he will find that he referred to working parents dumping their children on state-funded child care. Labour Members find that insulting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brazier</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have withdrawn nothing and I shall not withdraw those words. I am sure that you will rule me out of order, Mr. Malins, but I hope that you will allow me
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0938">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>855</span>
to respond to that point. The Conservative party voted collectively against the monstrous provisions in the Tax Credits Bill that will allow an almost unlimited blank cheque for state-funded child care for a range of people—even next-door neighbours. Among those who will pay for those measures will be the category of people with which the amendment deals in a modest and reasonable way. A person who has not been aware of becoming progressively more disabled, who has had a long-term wasting illness or who had an accident overnight may, for whatever reason, have previously given up their career to look after children. The years of paying contributions would therefore have been interrupted to look after children of a marriage. That person may not be a woman—in the household of one of my close friends, the mother earns the bulk of the income and the father looks after the remaining pre-school-age child. Both those parents are physically fit and the clause would not apply to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government may choose to reject not only the amendments that allow more general time flexibility but amendment No. 289, which looks after the interests of a particular group. Would it be fair to say to a woman—or, in some cases, a man—who has continuously made contributions for perhaps 10 to 12 years, "You chose to care for very young children or for a parent suffering from a chronic illness, which led to their death. Say goodbye to contributory benefit, and see what you can get on the means-tested second string".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>856</span>
I know that the Government have abandoned the pledges that they made at the general election. A great deal of fuss was made about the stakeholder pension in debate on earlier clauses—you would rightly rule me out of order, Mr. Malins, were I to refer to it in any detail. Are not the people to whom I refer stakeholders? They are making a huge contribution to the state, and it is costing the state nothing. Surely, whether through accepting amendment No. 289 or reducing the tightness of the time arrangements—by accepting our amendment or the Liberal Democrat amendment—something must be done for those people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I echo the point made by the hon. Member for Winchester. The clause has created a terrible muddle by introducing an unreasonably tight prescription for incapacity benefit. Other means of tightening up the benefit, such as the medical, would be much more effective. That is another example of what happens when a Government take three—or, arguably, four Bills—and try to ram them into one Bill and bounce them through together. A separate Bill is necessary—every hon. Member who has spoken on this clause and group of amendments has agreed on that. Reform is necessary and the bad drafting of the clause shows what a bad job the Government have done by ramming such disparate elements into one hasty Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
