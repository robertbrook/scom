	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Hugh Bayley)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Social Security (Incapacity, Earnings and Work Trials) Pilot Schemes Regulations 1999.</p></blockquote>
I share with the Committee my pleasure, Mr. Wells, at being under your chairmanship. As I entered the Room, I heard you saying under your breath, "I hope that he is not going to make any mistakes." I can put my hand on my heart and say that I have never been to a Committee considering a statutory instrument and made a mistake. That is perfectly true, because never before have I been a member of a Committee considering a statutory instrument. With your guidance, Mr. Wells, I hope that my so far perfect record will be maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations form part of the Government's policy of helping disabled people move into or to try out work. They are the first regulations to be made using the new piloting power provided under the Social Security Act 1998. That power allows beneficial changes to be made on a pilot basis, to see which are the most effective in helping people with disabilities or long-term illnesses who wish to move towards the world of work. I shall describe how the regulations will help them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations provide for two pilot schemes—the incapacity earnings provision, and work trials. The pilot schemes will operate for a year from 11 April 1999. The schemes will operate in 15 Benefit Agency districts that cover areas in England, Scotland and Wales. They will thus be available to more than 300,000 people who live in the locality of those pilot offices and who receive benefit on the ground of incapacity. They are part of a package of measures, which will also include testing the introduction of a jobfinder grant of £200 and a jobmatch payment of £50 a week payable for six months. The regulations will modify the Social Security (Incapacity for Work) (General) Regulations 1995 for those who can benefit from the pilot schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first scheme, for work trials, will allow people who have been incapable of work for more than 196 days to be treated as being incapable of work while undertaking work trials, a current Employment Service programme for jobseekers. The programme will allow employers to offer vacancies to clients on an unpaid basis for up to 15 working days. That will provide an opportunity for clients to try out a job, to see if it suits them, and it allows employers to evaluate the suitability of clients. During the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
trial, the clients will remain on benefit, and the employers and clients take part without obligation. Work trails are used for full-time vacancies of at least 16 hours a week that are expected to last for at least six months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second pilot scheme is for incapacity earnings. The provision will allow people living in a pilot area to do a small amount of any work, subject to a limit of £15 a week without losing benefit on the ground of incapacity. That can provide a valuable stepping stone for people wanting to move into work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations also provide for a smooth end to the pilot schemes if it is decided not to run further pilots or if the schemes are introduced nationally. On the expiry of the regulations, a person will be able to benefit from the pilot measures for a further six months. That will give people a reasonable time to adjust to the ending of the pilot schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two schemes are designed to give people claiming incapacity benefit the opportunity to try out work without losing their benefit, and we hope that they will give some of those with disabilities a real opportunity to take the first steps in moving from benefit into work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To inform future decision-making, we shall be undertaking a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation of the pilot schemes. That will allow us to understand the impact of the regulations, and to decide whether it is appropriate to implement the changes nationally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past, the welfare system marginalised people with disabilities by writing them off to a life of dependence. We have a duty to recognise the skills, abilities and ambitions of disabled people. We are therefore reforming the welfare state to make it inclusive and to empower disabled people to achieve their ambitions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are aware that many people suffer a severity of disability or a degree of ill health that means that they cannot work. We are committed to giving them financial support, so that they can live dignified and secure lives. However, 2 million disabled people already work, and surveys suggest that more than 1 million others want to work. We want to help them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our approach is based around four strands. First, we are removing obstacles to working from the benefit system. We have introduced a one-year linking rule for incapacity benefits and have removed restrictions on voluntary work. Before the change, the higher rate of incapacity benefit linking rule lasted for only eight weeks; we have extended it to 52 weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we are implementing measures to ensure that work pays, such as the introduction of the national minimum wage and the new disabled person's tax credit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, we are promoting radical changes in the workplace to ensure equality of opportunity. We are building on the provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, introducing the disability rights task force and working to set up a Disability Rights Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, we are providing active help and encouragement to people with disabilities to move into work through our new deal for disabled people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that is no less than a systematic attack on the barriers to work that are faced by disabled people. Many disabled people want to work, and we are firmly
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0487">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
committed to helping them do so by focusing on their capacities rather than their incapacities. Given that aim, and given that the regulations have been supported by disabled people and the organisations that represent them, I trust that the Committee will have no hesitation in welcoming such beneficial and worth while changes. I commend the regulations to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.37 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric Pickles 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brentwood and Ongar)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a great pleasure, Mr. Wells, to serve under your chairmanship and with your guidance. The Minister said that this was the first statutory instrument that he had taken through the House. If so, it bodes well for the future, because he did an excellent job—except when he strayed off the subject and made a number of what I considered to be false suggestions about the Government's policy on disabled persons. I do not take issue with him on that—it is a matter for another day—but I do not understand how a Government who want to get rid of the contributory principle and who want to tax those disabled people who have made their own pension provisions can be said to be acting in the best interests of disabled persons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two schemes deal with the £15 of earnings and with work trials. It is not our intention to oppose the regulations; indeed, we intend to vote for them. However, a number of questions arise, and I should be most grateful if the Minister would be kind enough to answer them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be most interested to know who chose the areas, and what were the criteria for choosing them. The regions listed in the schedule include "East London and Anglia". Only one district, Newham, and three offices are listed, all in the London area. The schedule would be better if there was something in the eastern area—in Essex, Suffolk or Norfolk. There is nothing in that area at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that 1 million disabled people wanted to work. Does he have an estimate of the number of disabled people who will take part in the pilot schemes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated assent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is excellent. I would be grateful if he would tell us what his estimate is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Miller 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ellesmere Port and Neston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to follow the hon. Gentleman's logic about the eastern region. I thought that King's Lynn, for example, and several other offices were in the east.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I come from that part of the country, and I do not consider that to be eastern England. I wanted to know what had happened to Essex, Suffolk and the eastern side of Norfolk. That is a reasonable question. I am glad that the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller) is taking an interest in our proceedings, and I hope that my response has satisfied him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister suggest how many disabled people are covered, and will take part in the pilot schemes? Will he say what the Government regard as a good success rate
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
and as a realistic target to achieve? I understand that he can do so as, in another place, Baroness Hollis of Heigham, who has responsibility for each matters, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We know that there is a rather high success rate with these trials and that people are kept on."—[	<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 23 March 1999; Vol. 598, c. 1281.]</p></blockquote>
I also understand that the regulations suggest that benefits will not be affected by the 15-day rule or by people undertaking small amounts of additional work. Will he spell out what people's benefit rights will be during the pilot schemes? Will those rights continue throughout and beyond the schemes? If a person decides to take additional paid employment after the pilot is finished, will that be regarded as evidence of whether he or she is capable of work?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am slightly at a loss about the disregard of earnings of £15. My understanding is that the only restriction is on the amount that a person can earn before it affects benefit. Late last night, Baroness Heigham said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The kind of situation we have in mind is where someone with a substantial learning difficulty may only want, or be able to work, two or three hours a week such a person would be able to keep all of the earnings—unless he or she is paid extremely generously—up to £15 without it affecting their benefit."—[	<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 23 March 1999; Vol. 598, c. 1280–1.]</p></blockquote>
She then discusses the effects of the 16-hour rule, at which point the disability working allowance kicks in. Am I right in saying that the hon. Gentleman's interpretation is correct and that what we are considering will not be quite as limited as Baroness Hollis suggested yesterday?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why was it decided to stick to the figure of £15? Was that because it relates to the figure that is currently disregarded with respect to income support? The Royal National Institute for the Blind has commented that it proposes
	<br><blockquote><p>"a review of the level of the disregard to reflect inflation given that the level of £15 has stayed the same since 1988, and would in fact be worth £27.80 if it were uprated in line with the retail price index."</p></blockquote>
There is nothing magical about the figure of £28, but it would provide an indication of the Government's general intention. A disregard of £15 is materially different from one of £27.80, with respect to the hours that a person on incapacity benefit might be tempted to work. If the Minister, rather than Baroness Hollis, is right and there is no restriction with regard to time, what is the effect of the national minimum wage?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Baroness Hollis talked yesterday about people with severe learning difficulties. The people whom I have in mind as likely to benefit from the provision are those with moderate learning difficulties. Time and again they seen to fall between two stools and be forgotten in the context of incapacity benefit. The gaining of work experience by people with moderate learning difficulties involves a problem that has mainly to do with education. There are several arrangements analogous to the scheme in question under which colleges offer a bridge to employment. Schemes of about six months' duration enable people to learn basic skills to equip them for the work force. They involve fairly simple stuff, such as dealing with money, using public transport, telling the time and generally acquiring confidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the schemes that I have described are funded by the college, eligibility for incapacity benefit is not affected. However, as the Minister probably knows, several
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0488">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
schemes are funded through the youth service, in which case incapacity benefit is lost. As far as I understand the regulations, that is because such youth service schemes are regarded as employment. I should like to know whether a relevant person in a pilot area would qualify under the scheme that we are considering to take such important courses in preparation for work opportunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has spoken of a figure of 1 million—he will give a smaller figure when we deal with the question of the pilot schemes. I am sure that the Government intend to make a material difference and to get people confidently into employment. If the Minister were to say yes to this category of people, the effect on getting those receiving incapacity benefit into work would be considerable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.49 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mark Oaten 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Winchester)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I echo, Mr. Wells, the welcomes given to you in chairing the Committee. Liberal Democrats very much welcome today's measures, as we do a number of current Government measures to empower disabled people to get back to work. I am tempted to take up a line which the Minister threw by commenting on other initiatives, but I would probably be ruled out of order. Having said that, I am concerned about current general piloting schemes and about some of the Government's rhetoric, which suggests that the schemes will put 1 million disabled people back in work. That will be difficult to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will take up two aspects of the regulations, the first of which is the £15 a week earning rule. The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) made some good observations, especially about the upgrading from the 1988 figure of £15 currently set for income support to a more realistic figure of £27.1 am interested in hearing the Minister's observations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition's point about the minimum wage was also well made. The result of the national minimum wage scheme would be that only four hours a week could be worked. Frankly, four hours is not exactly the enlightened expanding of work opportunities that the regulations aim to achieve. There is considerable concern about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second aspect relates to the 15-day work trials. Perhaps the Minister could help me through this, as I am not clear about what period the 15 days would fall within, no doubt on account of my inexperience of interpreting provisions. Will it be 15 days in a month, or a year?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am unsure, too, whether work trial periods are based on the concept of paid or unpaid work. Will the work be voluntary, or paid? Would payment call into question the £15 limit—or am I completely confusing two different projects? If the aim is to expand work opportunities for disabled people and genuinely pilot the schemes to test how they will work, the 15-day limit is insufficient to enable such people to gauge whether work experience is for them. Will there be some flexibility to take account of different types of trials? I can envisage trials for which 15 days would not be long enough to provide the sort of experience that we have to know about if the pilots are to be of use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
If the projects are to be successful, they will need careful local publicity explaining to people why they should take part in the process, and encouraging them to do so. The Minister has said nothing about how the Government plan to publicise the trials, although their success depends on publicity. I should be grateful for information about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about the cost of the process? These are pilot schemes that will be run nationally, but the Minister has told us little about the administrative costs in terms of time, publicity and the impact on benefits, although these things are not apparent to us. Once we know what the schemes will cost, we will begin to get a feel about whether the Government have budgeted for the pilots on a national basis—which is critical in terms of raising disabled people's expectations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final—critical—point is that we must know the measurement that the Minister anticipates 12 years on, when we have seen how the pilots operate. If we know the Government's benchmarks, we shall know whether we can work together to make the pilots a success, I hope that they will be successful and become national schemes, but we must know what we are judging.

I refer to one important point that the hon. Gentleman raised. He criticised the Government for using the figure of £15 as a starting point. However, I remind him that, from 1988, the previous Government introduced eight Budgets in which they could have altered that figure and they failed abysmally to do so. Clearly, the trials must have a starting point and we must judge whether the principles behind them and the £15 are sufficient to provide the stimulus that is necessary to make this important programme work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman, and I accept his "Yah-boo-sucks, we won the election" point, but we must go beyond the comic cuts and recognise that the figure of £15 derives from the level at which income support is set. However, the decision to go for a figure of £15 or £28 will go to the root of the kind of work and experience that people on income support will have an opportunity to do. If the figure is £15, the opportunities will be narrow. However, if it is £28, the opportunities will be wider and that would make a significant difference. Will the hon. Gentleman consider that point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whether, in the overall package, the figure is £15, £28 or even £150 will be an important factor in determining the success of the scheme. Such matters need careful assessment during the pilot study. As the hon. Gentleman accepts, the chosen base has a logical derivation and it will enable the Minister to introduce the scheme in trial form.

We must acknowledge that this seemingly small set of regulations will have an impact on the potential benefits available to people with disabilities. People often visit my surgery because they are frustrated that the system does not treat them as ordinary members of society and because they wish to be incorporated. The Regulations will start to break down barriers and that is necessary if we are to achieve that goal. My hon. Friend the Minister said that surveys showed that people with disabilities want to work, and that is the impression I have gained from consultations in my constituency. The principle of removing restrictions on voluntary work and work of therapeutic value, as it is described legislation, is particularly important. We must also consider carefully the value of work trials in the pilot scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is pernickety about geography, so may I be pernickety about what he has said? We do not seek to remove the word "therapeutic" from the legislation; it has always been there. We want to extend the provision to more than therapeutic work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps, as a man from Cheshire, my English was not clear to a man from Bradford. I share the hon. Gentleman's aim, and if I was not clear, I apologise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Work trials are important because we must break down the barriers and open the front door to allow a person with a disability to confront the working environment in a workplace, and to enable an employer to understand that that person's abilities might be remarkably well suited to the needs of a particular business. That is a key part of the regulations, which should be welcomed as an important step in the right direction. As a minor note, I checked the geography and noticed that there was no trial in Merseyside or Cheshire, which I regret. I look forward to seeing one in the not-too-distant future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A range of important points have been raised by hon. Members, and I shall try to respond to each of them in turn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar started off by referring to the contributory principle. I appreciate that we should not debate that subject at any length in this Committee, because it is not the matter before us, but changes were made to the benefits system before the general election. Indeed, there was a huge increase in means-testing. There have been changes in both directions. For example, we are extending the contributory principle by introducing widowers' benefits, which is a new contributory benefit. In other sectors, there is a move in the opposite direction, but it is certainly not true that the Government are abandoning the national insurance principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pilot areas were chosen to provide a good range of locations in both rural and urban areas, a good geographical spread and a range of demographic differences, including areas with high unemployment and areas with low unemployment. We shall learn lessons that will be applicable throughout the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The number of disabled people claiming incapacity benefits within the pilot areas is around 300,000. We have no idea how much take-up there will be as a result of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
pilot schemes. The point of piloting them is precisely to find out which of these measures will have an effect in providing the opportunities—which everyone in the Committee seems to support, and which is central to the Government's policy—to enable disabled people who have, effectively, been debarred from employment to get into employment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister has no idea what the take-up rate will be, can he explain what his noble Friend, Baroness Hollis, meant when she said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We know that there is a rather high success rate with these trials and that people are kept on."—[	<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 23 March 1999; Vol. 598, c. 1281.]</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister give us some evidence for those remarks?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The measures that we are taking have been used for some time, as broadly comparable measures have been available to people who are unemployed and claiming jobseeker's allowance. They have been successful in enabling people to get back into the labour market, but they are not available to people on incapacity benefit. The point of the pilot is to make such measures available to people who are on incapacity benefit, without putting them in the invidious position of having to come off that benefit and start claiming jobseeker's allowance, which would reduce their standard of living.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, we know that the measures work generally for people who are unemployed and seeking work. We want to include people who are on incapacity benefit, but we do not know how the measures will work. Some will work better than others, but we shall find out from the pilot. I was asked for how long each of the measures will be available. The regulations will establish a pilot for a 12-month period, with a six-month run-on at the end of that period if we decide not to roll out the measures more widely, or to extend them. The £15 earning measure will be available throughout that period. The three-week work trials, as its name suggests, will be available for three weeks. The six-month jobmatch payment will be available for six months, and the £200 payment for those entering the labour market off incapacity benefit is a one-off grant that will be available at that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Baroness Hollis and I am entirely at one. The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar asked what evidence the Government had that people would be interested in working for three or four hours a week for as little as £15. Perhaps I should say three hours a week— with an eye to another point raised by the hon. Gentleman about the minimum wage. There is a demand for such work. Through other new deal pilot innovative schemes, we found that people simply wanted to get a taste of work to the tune of one hour a week. We are working with two commercial companies—two restaurant chains—which are providing opportunities for people to re-entre the labour market on that basis. Obviously, they hope to recruit people who, in the fullness of time, will work for longer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope that disabled people, having re-entered the world of work, can extend their hours. There is a demand for that. General practitioners have advised us that there
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0490">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
are disabled people for whom work of up to four hours a week would be practical and useful. We regard the £15 level as realistic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do I take it that the minimum wage will apply? That goes to the heart of my earlier comment to the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston that it might be possible for people to work three hours a week, but not four hours a week. If people wanted to work one hour a day, which might be therapeutic and helpful to their condition, they could not do so because of the national minimum wage. I referred earlier to the figure of £27.80; the pilot area is supposed to enable people who are incapacitated to work one hour a day, but it will not be possible for them to do so because of the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that some people might find it therapeutic to work one hour a day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I withdraw the word "therapeutic".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point, but if there is therapeutic reason for a person to work, the person could work under the therapeutic earnings rule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations provide people with a taste of work, so that they can make a more informed decision whether to take a bolder step into the world of work. The £15 permitted earnings limit will attract some people to take that first step. Some people have asked why the level should not be higher, such as £25. We know that £15 will be an incentive for people to try work, but we do not want to create an incentive for people who have entered the world of work on a longer-term basis to remain on benefit. If the level were increased, it would create such an incentive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oaten</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the critical issue is whether the Government set the £15 a week level on the basis that people would want to work, on average, for four hours a week, or did they set the level because it is the same as that for income support?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be possible under the minimum wage provisions to work for four hours a week for £14.40.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We chose the figure because we believed that it was the best figure to pilot. We are seeking to learn, but if the figure is too low, it will not act as an incentive or encouragement; if it is too high, it will act as an incentive for people not to take the next step into the labour market. The measures that I have described, such as the job match payments, are intended to take people to that next steps. If someone increased their hours beyond the £15 limit, they would—if they met the conditions, as in most circumstances they would—become eligible for the job match payment that would give them a £50-a-week top-up. That top-up is paid to the individual, not the employer so that if he or she moves in stages from three or four hours a week to 16 hours a week a part-time job match payment will be given. As the hours increase, the individual will have access to other benefits from different parts of the benefit system. We are therefore trying to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
create a bridge to enable somebody who, under the previous rules, was locked into benefits to get into work without risking the withdrawal of the benefit security net should the world of work not prove feasible for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar raised the issue of training funded under the Employment Training Act 1973, which created special rules to allow people to protect their benefit position. If the hon. Gentleman writes to me on the issue that he had in mind, I shall respond, but I regret that I cannot do so now. The hon. member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten) welcomed the regulations. I am pleased that there is cross-party support for a bold new scheme that will create new opportunities for disabled people to enter the world of work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Neither I nor any member of the Government has ever said that we expect, or even hope, to get one million people off incapacity benefits and into work. We have said that the survey evidence shows that there are more than one million disabled people—having looked it up before the debate, I can give the precise figure of 1.4 million—on incapacity benefits who say that they would like to work. A small proportion are work-ready. If a suitable job were available, they could take it tomorrow. That is the first group of people whom we are trying to help. The majority would have to undergo quite a long preparation to be ready for work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's policy of getting the long-term young unemployed into work should be judged in terms of numbers, but if we start judging our policy on the disabled unemployed in terms of numbers rather than in terms of the changed quality of life that we are offering them, we will set the scheme up to fail. We are not rolling out a national programme with the expectation that a certain number of people will get into work. We know that the barriers to work for disabled people are prodigious, but we also know that many people facing long-term sickness on benefits are enthusiastic to work. We want to build opportunities that will enable such aspirations to be met and that is what the pilot schemes are designed to achieve. We are working in uncharted areas with clients who often have prodigious obstacles to overcome. We want to help them meet their goals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston and the hon. Member for Winchester asked whether a three-week work trial was long enough. For many jobs it will be. The three-week period is flexible. It will constitute 15 working days, which would normally be consecutive, but could constitute, for example, 30 half days, again consecutive, over a six-week period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme differs from that offering the £15 wage opportunity. People who participate in a work trial will not be paid. They will merely be able to work during that period to ascertain whether they can cope with work and what changes need to be made at the workplace to enable them to do so. It is a two-way trial. The people involved will examine their ability to manage in the world of work, and the employer will explore what such people have to offer. We intend involvement in the scheme to lead to paid employment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is being helpful, but I have difficulty in reconciling what he has just said about consecutive working days in response to the point made
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0491">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
by the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston. The Minister said that the period could constitute 15 days or 30 half days. If so, why do the regulations relate to full-time, and not part-time, work? How can someone trying out work on half days assess whether he or she is ready for full-time work? Why has part-time work been excluded from the regulations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman has misunderstood. Some of the regulations relate to part-time workers; the job match payment, for example, is available only to part-time workers. The work trial opportunity could be taken as a 15-day full-time work trial or, to use an example, a 30-day half-time work trial.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oaten</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is characteristically answering many of the detailed points. Given that he has now clarified that the 15-day trial will not be paid, and that the regulations relate to pilot schemes, surely a case can be made for allowing greater flexibility on the 15-day limit? In order genuinely to ascertain whether the pilots work and to be flexible about the work opportunities offered. Surely flexibility should be built into the regulations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In piloting a new benefit, as we are asking authority from Parliament to do, it is necessary to define clearly what is proposed and to observe how the new regime that is introduced performs in practice. If it is too flexible a model, so few people will ultimately participate in pilots, whether full-time or part-time, that genuine lessons will never be learned from it. It is therefore better to start with a three-week, or 15-working day, period. The period has some flexibility. It can constitute 15 working days from less than whole days, but that is the only flexibility provided. We shall discover its strengths and weaknesses. We may learn the lesson that the period should be longer, or that it should be shorter. We may learn the lesson that the scheme is not useful for disabled people, that we would do better to concentrate resources on personal advisers working with disabled people to find the bridges to enter work and that it would be better to consider other schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer to the final sentence in the section on the existing work trials scheme in the explanatory memorandum:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Work Trails are used for full-time vacancies (at least 16 hours) where the job is expected to last at least 6 months."</p></blockquote>
Is the explanatory memorandum wrong, or did the Minister make a slip of the tongue with regard to part-time work? If he did make a slip of the tongue, why is part-time work excluded from the regulations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was not a slip of the tongue. However, I may have made a mistake and I await my officials' advice. It would be possible for someone to enter a 15-day work trial on the basis of working a number of part days. That is a rather sensible way of entering a work trial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The job must be for at least 16 hours a week. However, such a job may be made up of a shift pattern of part-working days. The 16 hours may be made up of two eight-hour days, for instance, or four four-hour days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
It will be possible for someone to make use of a work trial scheme by trying out work over a total period of 15 days.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Stop digging.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members appear to be satisfied on that point, so I will move on to the next matter of query and consternation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Winchester asked about the cost of the schemes. The answer is £1.6 million, which is not a huge sum. We are piloting to find out what works. The schemes are not a welfare-to-work programme to get people into work but a way of finding out which welfare-to-work measures are effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All Committee members want to provide disabled people with bridges into the world of work. My hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston raised a most important point when he said that disabled people's skills must be matched to the needs of business if the schemes are to be useful and build such bridges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So we are talking not about providing mock jobs but about enabling disabled people with real skills to fulfil the need for those skills in the labour market. We may provide only short-term opportunities for people to be in paid work if we do not get that matching right. Moreover, we will not achieve our objective of providing disabled people with the independence, dignity and higher income that comes form getting into work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has been most helpful and generous in giving way. He has answered all my questions, with one exception. I asked about benefit protection with regard to periods outside the trial, and whether evidence relating to such periods would be used to indicate a person's ability to perform and work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely grateful to the hon. Gentleman for reminding me about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Experience in the work trials will not change the client's status in relation to the all-work test or the test that will replace the personal capability assessment when the Welfare Reform and Pension's Bill is enacted. Eligibility for incapacity benefit depends on the same test, using the same measures and scored in the same way. Participation in the trial will not affect that. That is most important; otherwise people on incapacity benefit would have a great incentive to steer clear of the initiatives. Someone's benefit eligibility is unaltered if a work trial does not work out. Disabled people for whom work trials are an option get an opportunity without any risk whatever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Disabled people with a huge amount to offer employers are taking part in some of the innovative pilot schemes running under the new deal for disabled people. I recently visited one such scheme in the north-west. That is pertinent, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston was saddened that there are to be no pilot schemes in the north-west.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the input of Government funds, Centrica—a company that grew out of British Gas—agreed to provide job opportunities for 50 disabled people or their carers. In
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0492">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
some cases, the two were taken on together, so the disabled person and the carer went into the workplace together, worked side by side and earned two wages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I met the head of human resources while visiting Centrica and he told me that the scheme had been a rip-roaring success, which was going to be replicated across the country. He said that the company would not even need Government money because the disabled people were more productive than the able. It is a telephone call centre. The disabled were more productive because they were probably more skilled and better educated. They had previously been debarred from work because of physical barriers and, in some cases, the prejudice of employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The manager told me of one person who came in every morning and greeted his team by asking, "What are we going to do today that is new?". The manager said, "What do you mean? We will do what we normally do: answer the telephone, hear what complaints people have about their gas bills, make notes accordingly and take appropriate action." The disabled employee said that he wanted to know what could be done to make things better. The manager knows the team leader and discovered that his was the most productive team. Employers are finding that disabled people have tremendous skills to offer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many employers say that they do not want to take on disabled staff because they will be sick and unreliable. Yet the sickness record of the disabled people at Centrica is better than that of the able-bodied employees. The management were trying to work out why. It was possibly because disabled people were better at coping with discomfort and sickness and knew how to deal with it; possibly because they did not go out on the razzle so much on Thursday nights. They are not certain why, but the message is clear that disabled people are a tremendously important untapped resource for employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope that the pilot schemes will help more disabled people into the labour market. Once they have a foot in the labour market, employers can see what they have to offer. Disabled people will be given jobs not out of a sense of compassion or charity but because they are bloody good workers. That is what we hope to achieve with the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.28 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not detain the Committee for more than a few moments. First, I would like to endorse the last few minutes of the Minister's speech. He made a clear statement explaining why the regulations were necessary. We all know disabled people in our surgeries who would benefit from them. The Government's hearts are in the right place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will support the regulations, but I want to put two major problems on the record. The first relates to the £15. I want to go back to the point raised by the hon. Member for Winchester. I and the Committee would have been happier if Government Members had sat down and asked how many hours it was reasonable to work, taking into account the minimum wage and the disregard. An hour a day is, in my view, appropriate for a five-day week, so the Government have pitched the figure wrong. It was a mistake to put the figure as low as £15 and it will affect the way in which the trials operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point related to full-time work. It is also a mistake to be too hide-bound by the 16-hour rule. On work trials, it would have been much better not to have been stuck with that rule. Much better figures would have been obtained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to move from incapacity benefit those people who want to work and put something back into society. I hope that the trials will be a success. We shall monitor them. I expect the two matter that I have pointed out will work against the ability to judge numbers. I accept the Minister's point about quality of life. However, that must be measured by the number of people whose quality of life is improved by the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bayley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to receive such warm support from hon.
