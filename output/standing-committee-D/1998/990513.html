Local Government Finance (England) Special Grant Report (No. 47) on Rural Bus Subsidy Grants for 1999–2000 (HC 407)</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>4.32 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the Committee begins, I should make it clear that if there is a second Division in the House, I shall suspend the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Ms Glenda Jackson)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Local Government Finance (England) Special Grant Report (No. 47) on Rural Bus Subsidy Grants for 1999–2000 (HC 407).</p></blockquote>
It is a pleasure to be serving under your chairmanship, Mrs. Dunwoody, after what seems an unnecessarily long time.<br><br>
The special grant to which report No. 47 refers is for rural bus services. It is part of the Government's positive action to support rural communities and, in particular, to improve their mobility and ensure more travel choice. Some £50 million a year of new money for the support of such services was announced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor in his 1998 Budget—<i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andy King <span class='memberconstituency'>(Rugby and Kenilworth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mrs. Dunwoody. I was trying to clarify something.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would resume his seat while he carries out this interesting clarification. The Minister is on her feet introducing the order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is the second year of the new grant.<br><br>
It is well known that in rural areas, car ownership is higher than in the towns. That can only make transport more difficult for the minority who do not have a car. People without ready access to a car find their lives and choices restricted: access to jobs, shops, schools, entertainment and hospitals can be more difficult, but public transport can address those difficulties.<br><br>
Local bus services have a crucial role to play in offering transport choice. They can provide lifelines by offering a flexible and adaptable way of meeting rural needs, but buses may need revenue support from local authorities. That is why the £50 million a year is so important. It shows our commitment to helping rural communities flourish and protects the environment by providing an alternative to the private car. It also
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
shows our commitment to local government. The grant is distributed to local authorities in proportion to their rural population and I pay tribute to the hard work that they have done in letting bus subsidy contracts.<br><br>
The £50 million is an annual total for the whole of the United Kingdom. It is divided between the four nations by the Barnett formula. The English share is £41.7 million. Of that, £32.5 million is being distributed to local authorities as set out in this report. It will be used to support new or improved rural bus services.<br><br>
We have also set aside separate funding for the rural bus challenge competition. The results of the first competition were announced in December last year. Following a further allocation in this year's Budget, funding for the next two challenges will be increased to at least £15 million a year. The remaining £4.2 million a year has been devoted to community-based initiatives and is being administered by the new Countryside Agency. It will build on the success of existing schemes and facilitate better co-ordination of voluntary, local authority and commercial services.<br><br>
We attach considerable importance to monitoring the impact and effectiveness of the new money. Returns from 55 of the 71 authorities revealed that more than 550 totally new services and 740 enhanced or improved services were in operation as a result of the first year's funding. I am sure that hon. Members agree that that is a significant impact.<br><br>
Each of the respondents has given us examples of their success stories—new services that are already proving popular and meeting a clear need. I trust that it will be in order for me to give just a few examples of those new services.<br><br>
In Northamptonshire, three new Saturday return services between Grafton Underwood and Kettering offer access to the town centre, hospital and leisure village. In Gloucestershire, a new service has provided the opportunity for five previously unemployed residents of Lydney to find work in Coleford. In Cumbria, an improved network of services into Ulverston near Barrow offers four sevices every 90 minutes. They connect with an express bus service to Kendal, whose frequency has also been enhanced.<br><br>
To allow continuity, grant distribution has been kept the same this year as last. We have asked local authorities for detailed monitoring of the impact of the grant. A survey is being conducted with the help of the Association of Transport Co-ordinating officers.<br><br>
In the interests of continuity and stability, we have decided in the second year to keep the allocation of grant the same. Similarly, the conditions under which the grant can and cannot be used remain the same. The grant is new money for new services in rural areas.<br><br>
The precise amounts that are payable to local authorities for this financial year are listed in annex A of the report. Hon. Members will note that nine authorities are to receive more than £1 million and that a further 25 will receive more than £500,000. I am sure that all hon. Members will agree that those are substantial sums.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0449">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
Annex B details the report's main features, including the mechanism for calculating the distribution of funds on the basis of rural population. It has produced a straightforward, equitable and reasonable distribution to rural areas.<br><br>
The grant must not be used to support a service that is essentially the same as one that was being operated as at 1 May 1998. However, that does not preclude the use of grant to provide additions to an existing service.<br><br>
A service must be registered with the traffic commissioner as a local bus service. It must run either entirely in a rural area outside a settlement of 10,000 people or, if it serves urban and rural areas, for at least three miles outside a settlement of 10,000 people and have at least one stopping place outside such an area.<br><br>
The grant will be paid in three instalments. The first 40 per cent. of each authority's total allocation will be paid upon receipt of approval by the House of Commons of the report. The second 40 per cent. will be paid in October on receipt of confirmation from the authority that it can spend the grant and that expenditure will be in accordance with the conditions that are set out in the reports. The remainder will be paid on receipt of an updated forecast later in the financial year. Once again, that should confirm that the authority can spend its allocation. If an authority confirms that the amount that it can spend this financial year is less than its current allocation, its allocation will be reduced to the lower figure and the balance will be put towards additional funding for the rural bus challenge.<br><br>
The special grant deals with rural transport, which was neglected for too long. It demonstrates the importance that the Government attach to the rural community and to the transport opportunities that are available to it. It shows that we are determined, as part of an integrated transport policy, to ensure that people have transport options other than the private car. It shows that the Government are concerned that those who cannot afford a private car but still have transport needs deserve to be brought into the wider community of work and leisure. I commend the report to the Committee.</span></p>
<p>4.39 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bernard Jenkin <span class='memberconstituency'>(North Essex) </span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I echo the Minister's welcome to you, Mrs. Dunwoody. In your impartial way, you bring an unrivalled expertise to these matters, but we cannot benefit from it today.<br><br>
I begin by saying how welcome these extra amounts for local authorities to spend on rural bus services are. I welcome the fact that my own local authority, Essex county council, is one of the nine authorities that will receive more than £1 million from this allocation of grant. However, the Minister must be honest about how substantial those amounts are.<br><br>
Although the sums may be substantial in terms of the amount that is spent on rural bus services, they are ludicrously insubstantial compared with, for example, the amount that the Government are taking away from rural areas in the fuel duty escalator, which will raise an extra £9 billion over and above the plans that the Government inherited from the Conservatives. We
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
learned this afternoon in Treasury questions that the Government are to continue with the fuel duty escalator until at least 2004. If one works that out, one realises that rural drivers are going to be paying £7 a gallon for their petrol.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Prentice <span class='memberconstituency'>(Pendle)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am a little wary of giving way to the hon. Gentleman because I think that he intends to talk extensively about the fuel duty escalator—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You may have some difficulty with that, Mrs. Dunwoody.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prentice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should not anticipate my remarks. Bus operators in rural areas receive subsidies through green diesel. What does the hon. Gentleman have to say about that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The bus fuel duty rebate existed under the Conservative Government.<br><br>
The important thing is that the amounts that the Government are putting into rural bus services are dwarfed by the vast amounts that they are taking away. If the hon. Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice) really thinks that a million pounds here and a million there will recompense rural areas, when in just a few years they will be paying more than £7 a gallon for their petrol, he has another thing coming. I doubt that the Labour party will hold a single rural seat if that continues to be its policy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Bradley <span class='memberconstituency'>(The Wrekin)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has been in the House longer than I have. Will he clarify whether he spoke against his Government's proposals to deregulate buses or against a former Conservative Chancellor's proposal to bring in the escalator?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The deregulation of buses has been a success; that is why the hon. Gentleman's Government have no intention of re-regulating. The hon. Gentleman should read the buses White Paper—maybe it was published so quietly because so many of the Government's supporters who expected the buses to be re-regulated are likely to be disappointed. The Government are very happy with the privatised bus industry that they inherited from the Conservatives and which they are now subsidising, and they are continuing with bus deregulation policies.<br><br>
If the hon. Member for The Wrekin (Mr. Bradley) is honest enough to look at the statistics, he will see that the effect of bus deregulation was to slow the growth of the decline in bus passenger numbers. Yes, we need to do more to improve the viability of bus services, but the amount of grant that we are debating is nothing compared with the vast amounts that the Government are taking away in taxation. Why do we not compare those amounts with the cuts in transport investment? The Conservatives were investing £700 million a year in the London tube, but that is now averaging £400 million a year and is due to tail off.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0450">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. If we assume that rural buses do not usually run on the underground, we might do better.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was merely asking the hon. Member for The Wrekin to compare the £50 million grant a year with the £300 million a year cut in London Underground investment or the cut in roads investment from £1 billion a year to less than £500 million a year. The fact is that the Government are taking far more out of transport than they are putting in. The Minister should have the honesty to recognise that.<br><br>
Perhaps we should also compare the rural bus services grant with other cuts in grants to county councils. The County Councils Network pointed out that the change in standard spending assessments and grant formulas means that county councils are losing more than £100 million a year. The Government are giving back £50 million a year—that is the figure for the whole United Kingdom; I think that the Minister said that £34.2 million a year is being given back to county councils in England. That is completely unacceptable.<br><br>
The problems continue. The Minister's policy before the election was vastly to raise expectations about what the Government would deliver. Never has a measly £50 million received so much publicity disproportionate to the effect that it is likely to have on people's lives. Yes, where an individual bus service is restored to a particular area it will have a benefit, but we are talking about a handful of bus services in my county, which has a population of millions. The Government's other policies are having a far greater effect on that population.<br><br>
I shall give two examples from my constituency. A bus service from Dedham has been cut while the Government have been in office, as has one from Fordham to Colchester. I have with me more than 300 signatures from the people of the village of Fordham who wanted the number 82 bus service to be saved—but no, not under this Government. Their rural bus policy is a fraud on the people of this country, who thought that they were going to get far more than the Government are delivering.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gordon Prentice</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose—</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Oh, I have got the hon. Gentleman on his feet again: how satisfactory.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prentice</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But figures from the Department show that in the eastern region 46 new services and 62 enhanced services are directly attributable to the rural bus subsidy grant. The grant is not de minimis; it is making a substantial impact on bus travellers in the hon. Gentleman's region.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I began my remarks by welcoming that, but it is important to put these issues into context. We know that new Labour is a past master at plastering little emblematic announcements and achievements over the newspapers and creating vast public
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
awareness, when in fact the fundamentals are still going wrong. The hon. Gentleman's party is not addressing those fundamentals.<br><br>
The fundamental issue in rural transport is that people do not have the mobility to which they are entitled in a modern society unless they own or have access to a car, or have reasonable access to, for example, community transport. Does the bus fuel duty rebate apply to community transport? No. The diesel duty increase of nearly 12 per cent. in the Budget has hit the tendering of community transport in my constituency. Services are having to be cut, particularly those for vulnerable people such as single mothers with no access to cars and elderly and disabled people who need door-to-door services. Do disabled people in rural areas get a fuel duty rebate? No. They are having to pay the extra fuel duties and cut their use of transport.<br><br>
The blazes of publicity for the Chancellor's ridiculous emphasis on this policy in every Budget announcement that he makes are of no real relevance or benefit to ordinary people in rural areas. I do not intend to detain the Committee for long. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear. "] I feel that we are being encouraged to carry on. Labour Members are obviously not enjoying listening to the reality of their policies instead of the spin that is handed out in documents from Walworth Road and pager messages from Millbank.<br><br>
I shall indulge Labour Members. I do not intend to keep them here, nor do I intend to divide the Committee, lest we be misinterpreted as not welcoming these grants. We know that that is what new Labour would do—it would issue press releases saying that we were against the help that the Government were giving. We welcome that help, but we note that it comes as a severe disappointment, and that it falls far short of the expectations that they so cruelly raised before the general election and have dashed.</span></p>
<p>4.49 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew George <span class='memberconstituency'>(St. Ives)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak. I shall keep my comments to the minimum, because hon. Members would not wish to be detained unnecessarily.<br><br>
I would like to welcome the rural bus subsidy grant scheme. I do not know about, and I am not here to comment on, the proportion of spin to finance in the matter. From speaking to public transport operators in my area, I know that they deeply appreciate the extra money available for rural transport. One such operator told me that it was the best thing that the Government had done for public transport in the area.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Strangely, even privatised companies do not object to the Government giving them money. It would be hard to find a bus company receiving an extra subsidy from the Government that would say that that was bad. The hon. Gentleman has not told the Committee anything of significance. The question is whether there will be the quantum improvement in rural bus services that the Government have promised.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0451">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind hon. Members that interventions must be brief.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps if the hon. Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) had not intervened, he would have realised that I had more to say on the matter. I was referring to a public transport officer, working within a county council, who said that it was helpful that the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions had become orientated more to public service, and less obsessed by roads.<br><br>
I agree with the hon. Gentleman that a relatively small sum is involved. However, it might achieve improvements in policy direction, including the provision of additional resources to much-needed services. He might say that extra public transport subsidies are not needed in north Essex, but I can tell him that we will have that money and be grateful for it in west Cornwall. I know that many other parts of the country would like it. His constituents might be interested to learn that he is saying that north Essex does not need the money that is being made available.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I put it to the hon. Gentleman that he is saying that which is not. I made clear that I welcomed the extra money—that is the third time I have said it to the Committee. I think that you heard me, Mrs. Dunwoody, and that everyone else heard me. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman has now heard me, and will withdraw what he said. I can only concur that those remarks were designed to encourage the rest of the Committee to believe that which is not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I heard what the hon. Gentleman said, but he made so many caveats and qualifications that I was not sure whether his original statement was what he intended to say. Having warmly welcomed the initiative—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely the hon. Gentleman is not introducing caveats.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There will be caveats to what I have said. Having welcomed the initiative, I was surprised to see that the Conservatives recently voted against the extra money for rural transport in the budget. That is one caveat.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hate to correct the hon. Gentleman again, but the Budget is concerned with taxation. I know that the Chancellor of the Exchequer hijacks the occasion to get publicity about spending, but the hon. Member for St. Ives will find that the Conservatives voted against no resolution on bus grants. He ought to set the record straight on that subject.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall have to return to the record and to see which way the Conservative voted on that matter. We were certainly given the impression—and the record is straight—that the Conservatives voted against additional money for rural transport.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Give us chapter and verse, then.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew George</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I may, I shall come to my second qualification. Making the extra 20 per cent. available through the rural bus challenge was not the best way of fulfilling the important strategic purpose of providing additional funds for rural areas. Many people, particularly in local government, are sick and fed up of having to make plans for challenges. There are not only the arts and technology college education action zones, but the health action zones—there are so many challenges. We also have the previous Government's rural challenge, business challenge, competitiveness challenge, and single regeneration budget regional challenge. The Government's challenges are creating a tremendous amount of work for local authorities, very few of which secure the funds at the end of the day, of course. That approach is ultimately turning a serious strategic issue into a frivolous exercise. The money that is available is needed and welcome in the areas that get it, but there is a strategic need to improve rural transport across the board. That is my second caveat.<br><br>
I have several questions for the Minister. First, annex B contains the basis for the population estimates. The figures for Cornwall do not accord with those that are available from the county council for the population living in settlements of 3,000 or less. In fact, the figure significantly underestimates the population in the area. In the light of that, I wonder to what extent the same is true of other areas.<br><br>
The previous Government used the 3,000 figure for rural housing policy and went into great detail when defining a settlement. Sometimes there were several settlements in a parish. I do not know whether this Government have, in assessing the matter, based their estimates on the population of parishes rather than of settlements.<br><br>
My remaining questions are as follows. How much has been allocated in the past financial year? How much of the available funding has been taken up? How much of it has been returned to the Treasury so far and how much is anticipated will be returned?<br><br>
Despite those questions, the report is a plus point for the Government and the Department. It represents an improvement in public transport in rural areas, such as mine in west Cornwall, where incomes are low and bus services are much appreciated. The report is a plus point, despite my caveats and qualifications.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I begin by briefly touching on the well-worn delivery from the hon. Member for North Essex. Regardless of the topic of discussions she invariably reduces it to an empty party-political rant. He slides over the fact that his Government introduced the fuel duty escalator and that the former Chancellor of the Exchequer who introduced it castigated Members of the Conservative party by saying that in the light of their support for the nation's commitments at Kyoto, all those who spoke against the duty were sailing dangerously close to hypocrisy. The hon. Gentleman has sailed off the edge of the world. He criticised what he perceived as the Government's failure to ensure high-quality bus services. His chosen method would be

regulation. I find that somewhat surprising given that his Government introduced deregulation of buses in rural areas. I shall send him the figures, which will refute his statement that deregulation increased the number of bus passengers in rural areas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We saw a most lamentable downturn in the number of bus passengers throughout the country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way, because she has misled the Committee?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. If the hon. Gentleman will allow me to finish—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Dunwoody. The Minister has inadvertently misled the Committee. I said that if she studies the statistics, she will see that—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andy King</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Perhaps hon. Members will allow me to run the Committee; I am sure that they have other things to do. The hon. Member for North Essex will, however, bear in mind that he is not making a point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister studies the record, she will see that I said that deregulation had slowed decline in the number of bus passengers—I did not say that it had reversed it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sure that every word of our proceedings will be read with extreme attention by the entire population of the United Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be interested to read the <i>Official Report</i> to see whether I misheard the comments of the hon. Member for North Essex, as he is quite famous for changing Conservative party policy within 10 minutes from one side of the political spectrum to the other.<br><br>
Our bus daughter document was produced with a fair amount of fanfare, and it is important. It made it abundantly clear that if quality partnerships require some statutory force, we shall consider appropriate legislation. Those partnerships have improved bus services for many thousands of people throughout the country.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman accused me of having inadvertently misled the Committee. I pay him the same courtesy, as I am sure that he did the same in respect of the previous Government's investment in public transport. Every year, they published a wish list of roads that they never built and for which there was never the money—an approach that was reflected in their policy towards the tube network and to transport in general. Year on year, they reduced the investment in maintaining the existing road network.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman referred to the standard spending assessment. All local authorities have had the best SSA in seven years. He bewailed the lamentable
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
rural public transport services in Essex. I was somewhat surprised that he did not apologise for the services in his own constituency after 18 years of Conservative government. He could have done so in the pursuit of honesty, with which he is clearly much concerned.<br><br>
He said that our investment is totally inadequate. I do not think that any money was ever specifically earmarked for the creation of public transport in rural areas in any of the 18 years of benighted government under the previous Administration. Year on year, their policies were aimed at destroying public transport not only in rural areas, but in urban areas as well. What appears to the hon. Gentleman to be a lamentable amount of investment has in its first year produced 550 new services in rural areas and 740 enhanced services. As he said, his own county of Essex has received more than £1 million in rural bus grants.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman has written to me about the removal of a service to Dedham, which is in his constituency. We have made it abundantly clear that the rural bus grant is intended for the creation of new services or for improving existing services.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Lady see the danger that bus companies may be tempted to remove buses from existing unsubsidised routes in order to put them on to new, subsidised routes from which they will gain a higher return? I am not saying that that has happened in any specific case, but does she regard it as a danger?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jackson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have greater faith in the acuity and perspicacity of local authorities than that they would fund a new rural bus service if they perceived—as they are in the best position to be able to do—that it was being presented simply as an alternative to an already established service. I cannot believe that the hon. Gentleman, who I understood was firmly committed to the idea of private entrepreneurial building of markets, would argue that the private sector would take off bus services that were showing a return on their investment.<br><br>
The hon. Member for St. Ives (Mr. George) was most gracious in welcoming the contribution that the Government have made in this respect. I can well understand why he would be so grateful, because Cornwall has received more than £1 million in this year's rural bus grant, which has created 29 new services and improved 48 existing services. He was concerned about how we decide on the apportionment of such grant. As I have said, it is decided upon the well-established Barnett formula. I know that the issue of rurality can be argued about. I have heard arguments from some areas to the effect that they should have benefited from the definition of rurality and arguments from other areas to the opposite effect. Many different factors and formulas are involved in attempting to make the decision.<br><br>
I shall explain the method that is used for the distribution of the rural bus subsidy. Land is coded depending on its use and level of development. Where a distance of 200m exists between developed areas, the counting for a new settlement of an urban area begins.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0453">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
Each settlement is ranked in order of population size for each local authority, enabling a cut-off point at any population chosen. If an urban area straddles more than one local authority, its total population is used to assess qualification and the total is then allocated to each authority according to where people reside. The rural population of an authority consists of all the people in the local authority area who do not live within an urban area as selected for the cut-off. In the case of the rural bus subsidy, the cut-off point is 3,000. That figure was also used for the village shop rate relief scheme and the right to acquire scheme for housing association tenants. Other schemes have chosen different cut-off points—10,000 is another widely recognised total that is used by the Rural Development Commission. We chose the 3,000 cut-off point because we believe that it produces an equitable and reasonable distribution that directs the highest amounts at the most rural areas.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman was perhaps confusing two separate funds in relation to the creation of new rural bus services. As I have explained, the report deals with the apportionment of money from £50 million a year. Local authorities are asked to put in challenges for the additional money that we have found for the rural bus
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
challenge. Given the number of applications for money from that fund from local authorities all over the country, I do not believe that local authorities found it particularly difficult. The ideas that were put to us were both innovative and imaginative, and that is of course what we are looking for in terms of the rural bus challenge. In some remote and sparsely populated areas of the country, what we would call an ordinary bus service would not meet the needs of the local people, and that is what the rural bus challenge is for. We have managed to increase the amount of money for the rural bus challenge from the initial £4.2 million to more than £15 million over the next two years.<br><br>
I trust that I have answered the questions that have been put to me, and I commend the report to the Committee.</span></p>
