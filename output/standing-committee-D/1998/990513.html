	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Trade and Industry (Mr. Ian McCartney)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That the Committee has considered the draft Unfair Dismissal and Statement of Reasons for Dismissal (Variation of Qualifying Period) Order 1999.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome you, Mr. Cunningham, to the Chair. A few years ago, we dealt with a serious employment relations issue similar to this subject, so I am pleased to move this order now. I hope that every member of the Committee will embrace it as being reasonable, as employers and employees have done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order is an important part of the Government's package of employment legislation and is fundamental to the concept of fairness at work. It will help to improve security for 2·8 million workers, while maintaining substantial flexibility for employers in their recruitment practices. It will encourage the introduction and use of proper disciplinary procedures by those employers who do not have them, and it will have wider benefits in terms of improved employee commitment and productivity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reduction in the qualifying period was proposed in the White Paper, "Fairness at Work" last year. It was overwhelmingly supported by all categories of respondent, including employers and their representatives. Many of the 168 responses in favour of the proposal were from employers, including the Conservative trade union group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As stated in the regulatory impact assessment that accompanied the order, 90 per cent. of companies already have written procedures. Although they are not always a guarantee of fair treatment, we know that employers who lose before a tribunal are most likely to be those without such procedures. Therefore, those procedures significantly help good practice, and employers can discipline people when necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When protection against unfair dismissal was introduced, one of the marked effects was a significant improvement in recruitment procedures. Employers took more care to recruit the right staff for the job, enabling them to benefit from better skilled and more suitable entrants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Employers need some leeway to take a risk, perhaps to give the benefit of the doubt to someone re-entering the labour market, or to those who have other characteristics that may put them at a disadvantage against more conventional candidates. We want to
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
encourage employers to take risks that can reduce social exclusion, and to give them a chance to recover if they make a genuine mistake in recruitment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not unreasonable for employers to be left in a state of uncertainty about the security of their employment if they have been in the job for as long as two years. We believe that a year is a reasonable length of time for an employer to decide whether a recruit is suitable for the job. That view was widely shared by the respondents to our consultation, including the Confederation of British Industry, which has made a statement supporting our proposal today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not a heavy burden for business to use proper recruitment and probation procedures. If employees subsequently fall short of the required standard, the employer will remain free to dismiss them, provided that the treatment is fair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order will reduce the length of service employees will need before they can request written reasons for dismissal. Employers must provide written statements within two weeks of such requests. That is an important complement to the unfair dismissal qualifying period. It is important that employees know why they have been dismissed; it enables them to decide whether to make a claim for unfair dismissal. Providing a written statement of those reasons on request is a simple matter of good practice, but it is useful to employees because it provides them with the basic information that can help resolve disputes and prevent unfounded tribunal claims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measure will continue the Government's programme of combining flexibility in the labour market with security and minimum standards for employees. As one employer said in the consultation, "It will present no problems for us or other well managed organisations." I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.4 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Boswell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Daventry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I too welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Cunningham. I have not previously had the privilege of serving under your chairmanship on a Committee, but I know that you have industrial experience and knowledge and that you will bring us to order if we misbehave—which we have no intention of doing. We are also pleased to see the Minister back in his place. It would be against nature for us not to be together in Room 10 on a Thursday morning debating industrial relations. I am glad to see that, even if he has been unwell for a while, his sense of humour has not deserted him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also welcome the opportunity of debating the issues. For the benefit of any member of the Committee who doubts it, we are strongly committed to good practice in the workplace. As the Minister conceded, it is a matter of finding the appropriate balance between the different interests. The Minister nods when I say that. In the revealing exchanges that we had on the Employment Relations Bill, which I will not rehearse now—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The Minister tempts me, but I suspect that the Chairman would not wish me to go into that legislation, although it is part of the same complex of measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0376">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
The Minister was decent enough to agree that to have employment rights, one needs a job in the first place. One needs the right balance because if it is not in employers' interests to employ someone, they will inevitably not do so. One of our major concerns with the fairness at work package is not so much the question of extending rights to existing employees as the danger of creating a climate in which employees may not be employed at all. However, those are policy matters, to which I shall return in a few moments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister did not speak about the order's detail because there is not much to speak about. Not every text of an order or statutory instrument is as pellucidly obvious as this one; it effects the Minister's intentions clearly and concisely. When I had finished reading it, I found myself asking, "Is that it?", and then realised that it was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, a number of technical points need explaining. The intention of the order is clearly to reduce the qualifying period of continuous employment before a tribunal can entertain a claim for unfair dismissal from two years' continuous service to one year and, in a concomitant and logical extension, similarly to reduce the period after which one has a right to receive a statement of reasons for dismissal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first point I query is on the method of altering the qualifying period, which has moved about over the years. Until 1979, it was a six-month period and was then extended by the then Conservative Government to a 12-month period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That takes us back to 1986.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, I was going to say that it went up to a year and was then extended to two years, which is where it is now. My understanding of the Employment Rights Act 1996, which is signalled in the order, is that a Minister could move a variation order at any time; would the Minister confirm that? We have said much in various debates about the unintended consequences of proposals and the Minister should tell us whether, if a period turns out to be misguided, he can change it by order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government made it clear in the White Paper that the measure was a settlement for this Parliament. These proposals flow from the White Paper, through the Act to the order, which enacts the period of one year. It is a settlement for this Parliament and the Government will not be coming back to make reductions in the qualifying period, if that is the implication behind the hon. Gentleman's question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is helpful to have that clarification. In fairness to the Minister, he said that "Fairness at Work" is a settled arrangement, although he knows that there are lots of details to fill in, of which this is one. Bearing in mind the fact that this is secondary legislation attaching to pre-existing legislation, rather than new stuff, my understanding is that there are powers of variation. If either he or a subsequent Minister deemed it necessary to change the period, he could simply do so with an order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our Conservative predecessors were very helpful in allowing us to deal with the matter in this way. I repeat that this is a settlement for this Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is helpful and I assure the Minister that I am not trying to trap him into any degree of inconsistency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many have tried.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that many have tried, but I understand that he wants to be consistent. The flexible order-making power that requires us to be here on a Thursday morning will have advantages if circumstances change. In other parts of the "Fairness at Work" package, I think that the Minister would have blessed the opportunity of having the flexibility to make changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second technical point is always a bug bear. The Minister will know that it is something of a King Charles' head as well as a bug bear. I refer to the transitional provisions. It is important that we get them right for employers and others. I dare say, without betraying confidences, that the Minister will not be surprised that a senior, distinguished Conservative barrister, who has a background in employment law, consulted me about when the provisions would come into effect and what their implication on existing contracts would be. In my lay and—I hasten to say—unpaid way, I did my best to explain the position. It would be useful if the Minister would clarify how the system will work. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I may tell him afterwards who it was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My understanding is that there are three instances in which the order might not apply, which are as follows: first, if the notice period has been worked out before the end of May when employment has come to an end; secondly, if payment has been made in lieu of a notice period that would have expired by the end of May; and, thirdly, if the fixed contract period had ended by the end of May. In that case, the employee who might be tempted to say that he had been unfairly dismissed would have the old rights, so only if he had been employed continuously for two years could he make a claim for unfair dismissal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, if the notice period had not been completed by the end of May, or if a contract were still in force, the employee could avail himself of the new order. If someone is in employment on 1 June, however long it has lasted, provided that it is more than one year of continuous employment, he would be able to claim his rights under this order. I should like the Minister to give us a short formulation, so that it will be on the record for practitioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There seem to be two levels of retroactivity. First, in any employment that was entered into by mutual consent, under the old rules, if it is has not been discharged by the end of May, the new rules will apply. There is a change in the old conditions of employment, in effect, which we must acknowledge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a little more concern about the second level, which is what the transitional period conditions bite on. Even if notice had been given under the old rules
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0377">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
because an employer felt that he had made a mistake and it was an unsatisfactory employment, the new rules would apply if the employment had not been terminated within the meaning of that schedule to the Employment Rights Act 1996 by the end of May. That clearly is retrospective and it could create some difficulties. However, those are comparatively straightforward, technical problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now invite the Minister to comment on one or two matters of political and economic substance. We need to know the Government's motives for making the order. Is it part of the "Fairness at Work" agenda? The Minister referred to last year's White Paper. It is partly the result of proposals that otherwise turned up in the Employment Relations Bill. I have no quarrel with the Minister's intentions, but he stressed to employers, as if it were a benefit, the importance of good practice in labour relations. Indeed, the Minister will concede that the original unfair dismissal rights were conveyed by a Conservative Secretary of State in the 1970s, in legislation that was otherwise regarded as being quite controversial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no argument between us that employers should enshrine good practice, or that it usually requires proper procedures—and, I hope, an understanding of the rights and dignity of workers. However, even in the White Paper, Ministers were unable to say whether there were specific incentives for employers. The Government prayed in aid that
	<br><blockquote><p>"employees would be less inhibited about changing jobs and thereby losing their protection, which should help to promote a more flexible labour market".</p></blockquote>
On the other hand, the White Paper says nothing about the potential inhibitions for employers in taking on employees and then finding they are saddled with them. Even if they turn out to be unsatisfactory, it is difficult to dismiss them after the qualifying period. Of course, there is no precise art in this, but it is nevertheless important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will have heard me say this before, but it is worth saying again: the biggest change that a small business can make is not to initiate training, but to move from zero employees—true self-employment— to take on an employee. That is the big test. I declare my own interest in the matter, as the employer of one full-time employee. That is when one comes into contact with employment rights. One runs the risk of falling foul of an employment tribunal, and one seeks, I hope, to behave in a sensible way and to avoid it, but one nevertheless exposes oneself to the risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If employers feel unable to discharge someone who has proved unsatisfactory for whatever reason, they will be more reluctant to take employees on. That element of motivation is underplayed by the Government. However—I realise, Mr. Cunningham, that this is not the time or place to debate it—they should not underestimate the cumulative impact of the various changes that they are making under the banner of "Fairness at Work" that affect the motivation and happiness of employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
The Minister was happy to cite the CBI's giving a fair wind to the proposals, but it is interesting to note that, on this very day, a report emanates from the CBI, which I have not studied in detail, saying that 43 per cent. of large companies believe that the laws such as those limiting working hours are likely to hit their performance significantly, and that only 9 per cent. of companies said that the legislation would help them. That would suggest that, for some of the reasons that I have stated, they are not fully signed up to all aspects of the "Fairness at Work" agenda.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Employers will not want to march into the saloon bar, shout their mouths off and say that they are sacking or laying off the whole of the work force. I would not condone that, but there may be a slower and more insidious effect in demotivating employers, which will stop them creating employment, particularly smaller employers who are on the whole the major creators of new employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To put it simply, there will be not a big bang in the labour market that suddenly reduces unemployment, but the continuous destruction of jobs, which will have the same effect over a longer period. I hope that the Minister of State will bear that in mind. I can see his motive in not wanting to destroy jobs, but if he persists with the order, as he no doubt will, he should give some thought to the unrolling consequences of it and his other proposals, and whether they end up doing just that. That is our major worry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister say a little more about his calculation of the costs, their impact on business and the number of employees likely to be captured by the move from two years to one? He must also consider the implications of the order for employers seeking to escape from its effects by prescribing fixed-term contracts of less than one year. The Minister will remember that we debated the matter before, but going below one year to avoid the unfair dismissal provision could mean that employment churns faster and is not improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised that the Minister did not mention gender discrimination, but it is worth the Committee thinking about it. I understand that employment law practitioners believe that the Government are coming under some pressure as a result of European legislation on gender discrimination. If more females had short-term contracts than males, the two-year qualifying period might have resulted in fewer of them having employment rights. It could then be argued that they were being discriminated against compared with males.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make no value judgment on the matter, except to say that I do not regard myself as being hostile to women's employment rights. Some members of the Committee will know that I have a household which at full complement is 80 per cent. female. It is now subject to people going out into the labour market as they grow up, but I have one wife and three daughters and I am committed to their being able to play their full part in the labour market on an absolutely equal basis with men.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0378">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
The Minister of State will also know that however good the intentions of legislation, such as the Equal Pay Act 1970, it is difficult to change a culture. He will know from recent studies that even though we legislated on equal pay as long ago as 1970, there are still some considerable disparities. The point remains, however, and it would help if the Minister would tell the Committee if rebutting challenges on the European front was an underlying motive for the order. I suspect that my hon. Friend the Member for East Yorkshire (Mr. Townend), who may seek to catch your eye, Mr. Cunningham, has robust views on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I warn the Minister that at least one acquaintance of mine is a practitioner in employment law. He points out that his gender arguments may go either way. I did not speak at length when the Committee was considering the closely related new £50,000 limit on claims for unfair dismissal. My acquaintance's professional view is that, as more males are more highly paid than females, the limit is itself discriminatory vis-a-vis males, and could probably be attacked for that reason. I note that my hon. Friend the Member for East Yorkshire is chuntering, reasonably enough, about the difficulties of Europe's intervening in such matters. That should be part of a gender agenda, and the Minister should acknowledge that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, the Minister will know—as we have debated employment law in different ways—that we have reservations about prescribing what he thinks is good employment practice in law. We can see some of the difficulties for employers—especially small firms— who feel themselves constrained by the law and may be frightened about the implications of taking on employees. More generally, we are concerned about the implications of unintended consequences, whatever the Minister's motive, and the overall costs for industry. By itself, the order will not amount to a huge threat to British industry, and I do not want to overstate that case to the Committee. Nevertheless, it is one of a package of measures that will impose on businesses some costs, and certainly some fears of costs. That should not be lightly brushed aside by a Minister whose Secretary of State is beginning to say in public that he may not have the right balance with regard to deregulation. The head of his better regulation task force has also said that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will not finalise the balance in Committee, but we invite the Minister to think twice about it. I strongly advise him against selling the proposals on the basis of the imminent arrival of the new Jerusalem, although in fairness his tone was not in that mode. I strongly advise him to consider the debate and the potential difficulties that we have explored, and to be mindful of the potential pitfalls in his continuing analysis of the situation in the Labour party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chidgey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is restored to his usual figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be brief, as I do not think that it requires the length of discourse that we may fall into later. Most of the remarks made by the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) were helpful, especially those on the transitional periods, although the leisurely ramble round the principles, follies and potential policies of employment relations were entertaining but not particularly helpful, so I shall not dwell on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been a long-held view of the Liberal Democrats that the unfair dismissal period should be reduced to one year, so we have no argument whatever with the Government's proposal: in fact, we welcome it. There will always be concerns and fears about suspected elephant traps and about the impact on employment by small and new firms and the potential churning of employees if the period under which unfair dismissal can be claimed is reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been an employer of a relatively small work force and I have made the key decision about whether to expand my work force to meeet the work that I thought we had to do. There is a tendency, especially but not necessarily in small firms, for managers to be a little lazy. It is easy to take people on, put them in a corner and forget about them. If managers are really concerned about the implications of reducing the period of qualification for a claim of unfair dismissal, and if they really value the organisation's human resources, they will surely monitor the performance of any new employees not within a year or two years, but within weeks and months of their having joined the organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is incumbent on a manager to set the example of efficiency in the use of people and resources, to evaluate and modify the skills of employees, train them, improve their performance and, if they cannot make the standard required of the firm, to do the decent thing and tell them that they should find another job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes constructive points, as he usually does. Does he agree that at least one of the duties that may or may not be imposed by law, but which it is incumbent on a good employer to perform, is to give advice if things are not initially going as they should do—not only training, but the employee's work practices—long before a year is out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chidgey</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with what the hon. Gentleman said about how to manage human resouces, no matter how large the scale of the firm. It is incumbent on employers to value human resources, to understand what their employees are capable of and to monitor, to guide and to train them to perform better. If the contract of employment is not going to work, the management is incredibly poor if it did not know that within a few months of the employee taking up his
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0379">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
post. To require a two-year period to reach that conclusion smacks of incredible inefficiency, poor management and, frankly, such a firm that should fail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.29 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Townend 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Yorkshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not follow the line suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry and talk about the European dimension. Instead, I want to talk about the effect that the order will have on small businesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the problems is that we are becoming a more litigious society and developing a compensation mentality. If not over-regulated, as I believe we are, we are certainly becoming more regulated. The proposals will increase the burden of regulation, particularly on small businesses. I have been owning and running small and medium enterprises for the past 35 years, and my family are still running them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is saying that the views of the CBI represent small businesses, he has another think coming. In all my 40 years in business, I have never thought that the CBI represented the interests of my companies. The Government should listen more to the Federation of Small Businesses because, without doubt, the order will increase the burden on small businesses and increase their costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister talked about proper disciplinary procedures and written statements on this, that or the other. That is all very well for large firms. It is all right for my firm, which is now a medium-sized organisation, but the chap with two or three employees does not have time to spare to write out procedures and so on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian Cotter 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Weston-super-Mare)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Eastleigh (Mr. Chidgey)? I currently run a small business and it would be unacceptable if I had not assessed my employees early on to see whether they were satisfactory and dealt with them fairly. The order would not be a burden; it would reinforce good employment practice. It is certainly how I run my company.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Townend</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not necessarily so. For example, an employee could keep his nose clean for six months and turn up for work, yet, once he establishes himself, the position could change. Because of the burdens on businesses, all employers running small businesses know that if they become involved in industrial relations matters, it can cost them an enormous amount of money. Any business man with any sense would carry out a final review of new employees at about one year and nine months and, if they will not make it or they are not acceptable, it is in his interests to reduce his long-term liabilities by terminating the employment contract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us say that the review is altered from one year and nine months to nine months. In the two-year period, it might have been thought reasonable to keep on those people who were on the borderline in the hope that they would improve if they were given training
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
and had more experience. Under the order, if such people are kept on and do not make the grade, and have been employed for one year and one month, employers can run the risk of being subjected to thousands of pounds of costs. I know that few Labour Members have experience of small businesses—most of them have never run a fried-fish-and-chip shop—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Will the hon. Gentleman make his point and not try to provoke hon. Members?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Townend</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would never try to do that, but Labour Members have to accept that if they want to represent themselves as the party of business, they have to be in favour of small business. It is generally accepted on both sides of the House that if we are to create new jobs, they will mainly be in small and medium-sized businesses because larger businesses are getting rid of labour. There should be a quid pro quo to the proposals. If a company wishes to dispose of the services of a member of staff who is dishonest, incompetent or contravenes procedures and the new period of one year has been exceeded, even if it has the best disciplinary procedures in the world and follows them to the letter, it is in the employee's interests to take the company to the industrial courts, even if he has no case. The Government are to raise the damages limit to £50,000 so a small business with any sense will now take professional advice and be represented by experts—not just a solicitor, but a solicitor who is an expert in industrial law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recently had the case in my constituency of a shop where the branch manager was not very good and was replaced by a man who, after three months, asked his employers whether he could get rid of two assistants who were not obeying company procedures. The company duly went through the disciplinary procedures and disposed of the employees' services. They had been with the company for only nine months so the company expected that that would be the end of the matter. Three weeks after they left, the company was informed that it was being taken to the industrial court for sexual harassment, even though it had a proper written policy on sexual harrassment and no complaints had been made to management or senior management. The company hired a legal industrial relations expert who told them that although the employees had virtually no case, the claim had to be taken seriously. The case was listed for three days and the lawyer told the company that if it won, its costs, which would be a minimum of £3,000, would not be recoverable; if things went wrong, as we all know can happen in tribunals, and it lost, it would cost thousands of pounds. The lawyer therefore advised the company that although it thought the whole thing had been fabricated, it should offer the employees £500 to £1,000 each in settlement because that would be much cheaper than going to court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That appalling situation is a burden on small businesses. If small and medium firms feel that they are right and fight a case and win, they should be able to get their costs back. When that industrial relations legislation was introduced, it was meant to be informal so that workers and employers could represent
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0380">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
themselves and the costs involved would be low. It is now very costly and, because of the increase in possible compensation, will get even more costly. That is improper and unfair. Industrial relations is the only area of law I know in which one can be proved innocent and yet have to pay the costs. The Government should accept those costs or lay down that if anyone who is represented by legal aid, trade unions or law centres loses, those bodies should pick up the employer's costs. The number of cases is undoubtedly rising fast. The order will increase that burden and the cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour Members should go to their constituencies and talk to those who employ three or four people and work themselves. The burden of regulation that this Government have put on those people, such as the social chapter, paternity rights, the 48-hour week, the minimum wage, trade union rights—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I ask the hon. Gentleman to confine himself to the order before the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Townend</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I shall do so, Mr. Cunningham. I was simply saying that the order is one of a long line of such measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order will have an adverse effect on small business; it will have no effect on large businesses, because they have personnel departments that are wise to it and have probably provided for it in their budgets. Every business man—however good an employer he is—should include in his yearly budget a minimum of £10,000 or £20,000 to cover the costs of industrial relations tribunals, because the word gets round and everyone will try to bring a case against him. Even if an employee has stolen something, he will threaten to take him to an industrial relations tribunal, and the employer will give him £500 to go away because that is cheaper than paying £1,500 in costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Lewis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Worsley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be grateful to my right hon.

	<p>10.41 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a wide-ranging debate. I shall deal with the specific questions that have been asked, but I may have been provoked into making some general points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Daventry is quintessentially a team player. He has been played a team game on behalf of the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood), but I know that he is very uncomfortable about having to do so. Once again, he has had to tell the daft story that the Government, business, unions and employees do not have the balance right in the workplace. His first allegation was that the order will cost jobs. The Conservative party said that the minimum wage would cost a million jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the introduction of the minimum wage and since the order was announced last summer, 400,000-plus new jobs have been created in the economy. We have halved the number of long-term unemployed
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
people. The work force in all sectors of the economy has increased since we come to power. Employers do not view the proposals as anything other than good practice and minimum standards, and they have nothing to fear in their fair implementation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given that the minimum wage took effect on 1 April—except offshore, where it took effect on 1 May—and given that the order will come into effect on 1 June, is the Minister prepared to tell the Committee that a further 400,000 jobs will be created as a result of the implementation of the measures for which he claims credit in advance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A business has not closed down every three minutes of every working day since we came to power. No wonder businesses make it absolutely clear at every opportunity that at last they have a Government who support them. For businesses to be successful, employees must be part of the enterprise and feel that they are valued assets to the company. We have the right balance in the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the hon. Member for East Yorkshire that the reduction from two years to one year is supported not only by the CBI, but overwhelmingly by employers of all sizes. Small companies need not worry about paying £5,000 or £6,000 to an illegal employment relations adviser; the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service will do the work for them. A code of practice has been specifically designed for small and medium businesses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Townend</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is missing my point. I was saying that a small employer would be most unwise to appear before an industrial tribunal without proper legal representation, when the employee is likely to be represented by an expert, not by ACAS. The point is that even if the employer is right and even if he is accepted as being right by the industrial court, he still has to pick up a major bill for costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Two thirds of employers who are taken to an industrial tribunal win their cases. Only a third of workers win. Tribunals have to determine whether an employer acts fairly or unfairly. It is usually clear whether an employer has acted fairly, and tribunals will overwhelmingly give the benefit of the doubt to the employer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No employer who operates the code of practice should have to worry whether the tribunal will find that he has acted reasonably. The hon. Member for East Yorkshire cited a case in which an employee had stolen—he had committed a criminal act. It is ludicrous to suggest that an employer should be worried about dismissing such an employee. Such behaviour is gross misconduct and warrants instant dismissal. Nothing in the order prevents an employer from sacking an employee at any time provided that it is done fairly and within a properly constituted grievance and disciplinary procedure so that the employee can put his case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Townend</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that two thirds of cases are found in favour of the employer. Does he not accept that it is unfair on the employer, particularly
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0381">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
unfair if the employer runs a small or medium-sized enterprise, that he can then be landed with several thousand pounds of costs? Is that not unfair?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the tribunal system is to determine the process of disputes for employees who clearly believe that they have been unfairly dismissed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The previous Government ducked out on the issue, but we have gone further. With the support of my hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth (Mr. Healey), who carried the Bill through the House of Commons, we have created an alternative method of dispute resolution. The Employment Rights (Dispute Resolution) Act 1997 helps employers and employees to resolve disputes. But I have no sympathy with bad practice, the hire and fire culture, threatening and abusive behaviour, and sacking employees unfairly. Such employers deserve to be taken to a tribunal and they deserve to lose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cotter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may be interested to hear of my example. The hon. Member for East Yorkshire said that this is a tremendous problem for everyone. Fortunately, in my business career I have not had any cause to use the tribunal, nor has it been used against me. Many small business employers are fortunate in that respect and if they carry out good practice, that will continue to be the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. Only a miniscule number of cases go before tribunals. The overwhelming majority of disputes are resolved in the workplace and many more are resolved in other ways. As a consequence, those that go to a tribunal are a small number indeed. Perhaps the hon. Member for Daventry is telling us that new Conservative policy is to scrap tribunals. The previous Government restricted people's access to tribunals. Perhaps the new policy is to abolish them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to put the matter into perspective. Employers overwhelmingly want a balance in the workplace that gives them time to assess a worker's capabilities and, if the assessment is poor, to be able to dismiss him. That is more or less what we propose. Employers have been using the two-year provision for some time. If they wanted to retain it, they would have said so when the review took place, but they overwhelmingly took the view that two years was no assistance to good employment relations. They considered that it was to the detriment of good employment relations. They also considered that it was to the detriment of a flexible labour market, to which the hon. Member for Daventry referred. What encouragement is there for someone with accrued rights to move around the labour market? By moving around the labour market, they lose their right to be treated fairly in the work place. That is not sensible. The balance of our proposal is right, and that is why employers overwhelmingly support it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Daventry asked several questions about the transitional period. The reduction will apply to all employees whose effective date of
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
termination is on or after 1 June. He also asked what will happen in the case of processes that commence before that date. If someone is dismissed before the end of May without receiving the minimum statutory period of notice—one week—which would have taken him up to 1 June, he will be able to complain. Employers who act unreasonably in the run-up to 1 June and do not give such notice will realise that good practice means ensuring that in that short period between the end of May and 1 June they can continue with processes that are already in place only after complying in the way that I have suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important to clarify that point, and I approach it again in that spirit. The Minister referred to the minimum statutory notice period. If a different, contract notice period applies, am I right to understand that it is a private matter and that statutory rights will not be extended?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. A myriad of arrangements apply, but in such circumstances, that would be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Daventry and for East Yorkshire asked about the exclusions for small firms. I should like to make a short announcement. When he was at university in Hull, my hon. Friend the Member for Hyndburn (Mr. Pope) was a good customer of the off-licence of the hon. Member for East Yorkshire. My hon. Friend is more jolly about the hon. Member for East Yorkshire and his enterprise than some of his employees obviously are. However, my hon. Friend has not suffered much from the experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a big supporter of small firms, which increasingly dislike politicians using them as an excuse for bad practice. Overwhelmingly, small companies want to deploy good practice, and do so. Indeed, many small firms deploy better practice than some of their larger counterparts, have a better hands-on feel for relationships and deploy many measures. Small businesses are not intrinsically bad employers. We are aware that regulatory processes should not impact unfairly, and this one does not. Small businesses support the proposal, which simply changes the period from two years to one year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fabian Hamilton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the hon. Member for East Yorkshire has done his homework. I ran a small business for 20 years, employing between three and five people, and I welcome the measures. They will be good for small businesses, especially for good employers like me who look after their employees. I had a problem with an employee only once, and when she took me to an industrial tribunal, ACAS resolved the matter and no costs were involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To flourish, small businesses require a level playing field in a competitive marketplace. That marketplace should be reasonable, so that they are not continually undercut by employers who deploy bad practice to reduce labour costs and do not compete in terms of the quality of goods and services offered. That is especially
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0382">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
true in the case of the contractual arrangements that are increasingly used to achieve and retain contracts. Competition is involved. Good practice will help create companies with a competitive edge that can compete on the basis of quality; it will not lead to a downward spiral of wages, poor conduct or a lack of investment in training and education. Small companies welcome the opportunity to participate in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Daventry also asked whether the order will dent competitiveness. I realise that he must spin a tale, but a survey that the Confederation of British Industry released today shows one simple, burning statistic. Of the businesses in Britain that participated in what was the largest ever such survey, 75 per cent. said that the Government's proposals and their regime for working time, minimum wage and fairness at work would not have a negative impact on business. It was interesting that the survey showed that more smaller companies took that view than larger companies. I accept that there are some who have to spin the survey because it said something that they did not want to hear, but the Government are setting basic minimum standards that employers want to promote. We want to improve the lot of employees who work for employers who deploy poor practices and help those companies in a non-aggressive way to achieve better practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Townend</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that employers are not objecting to the working time directive and the 48-hour week. Has he consulted the hotel and hospitality industry, where the split-shift system that is accepted by both employees and employers will be made illegal under those new proposals? The right hon. Gentleman listens too much to bureaucrats at the CBI; he does not talk to ordinary business people. I visit trade organisations; in fact, I am speaking to members of a trade organisation this evening in Birmingham. If he talked to those people, he would get a different view of the world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This week, I have so far visited four small and three large businesses, and it is only Thursday. I have tomorrow and the weekend to go yet. I do not often listen to bureaucrats—of any type, shape or size. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I do not think of my officials as bureaucrats. They are trail-blazers and models of good practice for both the public and private sectors—it says here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Small businesses continually tell me that they want a Government who will work with them in a range of areas, including employment relations, and that is what we shall continue to do. We have a mandate to protect those employed by businesses, of whatever size, that operate poor practices and undermine the capacity of their employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Daventry referred to tribunal workloads. We estimate that there are between 10,000 and 14,000 tribunal applications, about a third of which end up at a tribunal hearing. There is no definite figure for dismissals, but we estimate that about 300,000 people with between one and two years' service are dismissed or made redundant each year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
That is the type of churn round in the labour market that the hon. Gentleman was talking about. As a result of the reduction in the qualifying period, the number of unfair dismissal complaints will increase. However, I hope that, alongside that, will be a process that will assist companies to change their culture and work practices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about the £50,000 limit. I accept that it is an appreciable increase, but only about 100 cases a year currently receive the maximum award of £12,000 and that amount is only received, of course, if that is what was lost. As for the whistle blowers' legislation, the CBI and employer organisations asked us not to cap compensation in such cases and, being a business friendly Government, we agreed with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman alluded to the case before the European Court of Justice of Seymour-Smith and Perez, which concerned gender. He asked whether the Government had been forced to introduce the order because of that ruling. The answer is no. The case has now returned for decision to the House of Lords. We believe firmly in equal treatment between men and women and aim to ensure that in all our legislation. We do not agree that qualifying periods, whether one or two years, discriminate against women. We want to reduce the qualifying period to ensure that all employees, irrespective of gender, receive decent and fair treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman raised several political points. We have rehearsed that debate and have reached a point of clarity. The Opposition do not like additional minimum standards in the labour market. They do not like a partnership approach, because it goes in a different direction from the one in which they tried to take British industry over the previous 18 years of conflict and more conflict. That period has now ended, thank goodness, and increasingly employers want a partnership approach with the work force, which the Government encourage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are fairly familiar with the Minister's formulations, which all come in slightly different forms. Will he at least concede that, for the number of working days reduced through strikes, we completely beat the record of the Labour Government into a cocked hat? We are proud of that fact.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have done even better. The figures are at an all-time low. I am glad that we will never even attempt to beat figures such as one million job losses in manufacturing, a further loss of capacity, three million unemployed and two recessions, all in 18 years. We have come out of that period of conflict and mismanagement of the economy, and we are in a new period of a properly managed economy and partnership approach between Government, employers and employee representatives. That is where we want to stay, and that is the thrust of the proposal. It will be seen in that light, and I therefore recommend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
