New Clause 12</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
CERTAIN OVERPAYMENTS OF BENEFIT NOT TO BE RECOVERABLE</div> <!-- title -->
<p>'.—(1) An overpayment to which this section applies shall not be recoverable from the payee, whether by the Secretary of State or a local authority, under any provision made by or under Part III of the Administration Act (overpayments and adjustments of benefit).</p>
<p>(2) This section applies to an overpayment if—
<ol>
<li>it is in respect of a qualifying benefit;</li>
<li>it is referable to a decision given on a review that there has been an alteration in the relevant person's condition, being a decision to which effect is required to be given as from a date earlier than that on which it was given;</li>
<li>the decision was given before 1st June 1999; and</li>
<li>the overpayment is not excluded by virtue of subsection (6).</li>
</ol></p>
<p>(3) In subsection (2)(b) the reference to a finding on a review that there has been an alteration in the relevant person's condition is a reference to a finding that that person's physical or mental condition either was at the time when the original decision was given, or has subsequently become, different from that on which that decision was based, with the result—
<ol>
<li>that he did not at that time, or (as the case may be) has subsequently ceased to, meet any of the conditions contained in the following provisions of the Contributions and Benefits Act, namely—</li>
<ol>
<li>section 64 (attendance allowance),</li>
<li>section 72(1) or (2) (care component of disability living allowance), and</li>
<li>section 73(1) or (2) (mobility component of that allowance); or</li>
</ol>
<li>that he was at that time, or (as the case may be) has subsequently become, capable of work in accordance with regulations made under section 171C(2) of that Act (the all work test).</li></ol></p>
<p>(4) For the purposes of this section "qualifying benefit" means—
<ol>
<li>attendance allowance;</li>
<li>disability living allowance;</li>
<li>any benefit awarded wholly or partly by reason of a person being (or being treated as being)—</li>
<ol>
<li>in receipt of a component (at any rate) of disability living allowance or in receipt of attendance allowance, or</li>
<li>in receipt of any benefit falling within sub-paragraph (i);</li>
</ol>
<li>incapacity benefit or any benefit awarded wholly or partly by reason of a person being (or being treated as being) in receipt of incapacity benefit; or</li>
<li>any other benefit awarded wholly or partly by reason of a person being (or being treated as being)—</li>
<ol>
<li>incapable of work, or</li>
<li>in receipt of any benefit falling within sub-paragraph (i).</li>
</ol></ol></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1026</span>
<p>(5) For the purposes of this section—
<ol>
<li>"review" means a review taking place by virtue of section 25(1)(a) or (b) or section 30(2)(a) or (b) of the Administration Act;</li>
<li>"the relevant person", in relation to a review, means the person to whose entitlement to a qualifying benefit or to whose incapacity for work the review related; and</li>
<li>"the original decision", in relation to a review, means the decision as to any such entitlement or incapacity to which the review related.</li>
</ol></p>
<p>(6) An overpayment is excluded by virtue of this subsection if (before or after the passing of this Act)—
<ol>
<li>the payee has agreed to pay a penalty in respect of the overpayment under section 115A of the Administration Act, or</li>
<li>the payee has been convicted of any offence (under section 111A or 112(1) or (1A) of that Act or otherwise) in connection with the overpayment, or</li>
<li>proceedings have been instituted against the payee for such an offence and the proceedings have not been determined or abandoned.</li>
</ol></p>
<p>(7) Nothing in this section applies to an overpayment to the extent that it was recovered from the payee (by any means) before 26th February 1999.
<br><blockquote><p>(8) In this section—
<ul>
<li>"benefit" includes any amount included in—</li>
<ol>
<li>the applicable amount in relation to an income-related benefit (as defined by section 135(1) of the Contributions and Benefits Act), or</li>
<li>the applicable amount in relation to a jobseeker's allowance (as defined by section 4(5) of the Jobseekers Act 1995);</li>
</ol>
<li>"income-related benefit" has the meaning given by section 123(1) of the Contributions and Benefits Act;</li>
<li>"overpayment" means an amount of benefit paid in excess of entitlement;</li>
<li>"the payee", in relation to an overpayment, means the person to whom that amount was paid.'.—[<i>Mr. Bayley.</i>]</li>
</ul></p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Question again proposed,</i> That the clause be read a Second time.</p>
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that we are also considering Government amendment No. 334.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies <span class='memberconstituency'>(Grantham and Stamford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: When we broke for lunch, I was saying that whether a legislative measure promotes good conduct and encourages good citizenship and social responsibility is perhaps the most important test of its soundness and justification. The proposal enshrined in new clause 12 undoubtedly fails that test. People who have responded to communications from the Benefits Agency which said, "We are terribly sorry, but we think that your condition improved some time ago, before the last review, and we would like some money back", and people who have not argued the toss and believed that the responsible thing to do was to pay the money back, have lost the money and will not benefit from the retrospectivity introduced by the new clause. People who argued the toss, played for time and defended their financial interests more selfishly will now be relieved of liability retrospectively. That is quite wrong.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary said something that I thought rather grated. It might just have been that he said something in a facile way during the heat of debate, in order to try to head me off, and that, on reflection, he does
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I1034">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1027</span>
not want to stand by his words. If that is his explanation, I shall accept it, but if he really meant what he said, I am concerned. He said that those people who have paid back the amounts that have been claimed by the Benefits Agency are those who can most afford to pay, whereas those who have not paid back the money cannot afford to, so there is justice in their being relieved.<br><br>
The assumption is that those who are most reluctant to pay are also the poorest, that those who are most hesitant in fulfilling their liabilities are the people who are most deserving of help. That shows a failure of elementary human insight, and I am deeply worried that there should be such a failure on the part of a Minister responsible for, among other things, the disabled, who are an especially vulnerable group. In fact, the reverse is often the case.<br><br>
Those who are most aggressive in promoting and defending their financial interests, and those who are most unscrupulous in doing so and in avoiding their liabilities and maximising their assets, are rarely to be found among the poorer sections of society. There is no reason why such people should be considered to be the most deserving. In the perverse new Labour world in which we live, that is the position created by the new clause, which might just be based on a lack of proper analysis and forethought, as is so much in the Bill. If it was carefully worked out in advance, and if the Government were aware of these aspects of the new clause when it was drafted, then it shows a serious and disturbing failure of sensibility and of political and moral judgment.<br><br>
There is another anomaly. The new clause creates an informational anomaly—something that, in my former days in the City, was known as a false market, in which some people have information, on the basis of which they can deal successfully, and other people are denied the same information. That is exactly the situation under the new clause. Those people who knew in February, when the accounting officer—the Secretary of State—sent his instructions to the head of the Benefits Agency, that the regime was about to change would have known that if they resisted demands to repay excess benefits within the terms of the definition then prevailing they would not have to pay them. Those who did not know about that communication would have paid in good faith and in the belief that they were fulfilling a legal obligation. In fact, that legal obligation could be removed by ignoring it. It would be curious in any legal system if ignoring a demand for payment avoided the legal obligation to pay, but that is precisely what the Government are allowing in their clumsy or ill-thought-out provision.<br><br>
There was an informational gap. Those who did not have the information are not necessarily the most virtuous, the poorest or the most deserving of sympathy and taxpayers' largesse—far from it. One might more reasonably conclude that those who were up to the minute in knowing about communications passing between the accounting officer—the Secretary of State—and the head of the Benefits Agency would have been the most sophisticated recipients of the benefits, or the best advised. They would have been in touch with people with professional involvement in the matter. They would have been close to Westminster geographically,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1028</span>
psychologically or mentally. The mass of the population is not familiar with such matters and does not follow them closely. Most people would have thought that they had a continuing obligation to repay the money, but not that that obligation could be extinguished by ignoring it. Such is the peculiar irony of the Government's thoroughly unjustified muddle—it is a double injustice and a serious injustice.<br><br>
What would we have done if we had been in power? [<i>Interruption.</i>] I can anticipate the question. The Minister of State is grinning, but he intended to ask that question, and has done so in the past. Sometimes, Mr. Malins, you and your colleague rule the question in order, but I am not allowed to answer it because I am ruled out of order, which is unfair. Perhaps, with anticipation, I can deliver the answer. I would have set a date—perhaps 1 February or, more fairly, a date further removed such as 1 December—and said that all claims to repay excess benefit before that date were valid and all subsequent claims would be relieved; if people in their honesty had repaid money to the state subsequently, they would have got it back. We would not penalise the honest and those who deal with the state in good faith. That is how a fair Government would have acted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Hugh Bayley)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely what the Government have done, with the date being 26 February.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But the Minister has already told me that people who have repaid money will not receive a refund—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman misunderstands. The direction was made from 26 February. The direction cannot undo what happened before that date, which is what the hon. Gentleman perceives as an injustice. We have set a firm date and the change will take place from that date.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The trouble is that the date is the date of the communication from the Secretary of State to the head of the Benefits Agency. That is where the injustice arises. The Minister told the Committee today that anyone who repaid money to the Benefits Agency before 26 February—I suggested to him this morning that that was probably the date and he has now agreed that it is—cannot claim it back. Anyone who repaid that money on 1 February, 15 January or 15 December cannot claim it back, but demands made on those who did not pay up and managed to gain time—even though the demands were made at the same time, in the same way and on the same basis—will be retrospectively extinguished. That is an injustice. Those who dealt with the state in good faith and with honesty will lose, while those who acted in less than good faith and were more aggressive in pursuit of their interests—it is false and misleading to suggest that there is an identity between that group and those who are the most deserving—will be rewarded. That is absolutely wrong.<br><br>
A date should have been chosen that was sufficiently far back to ensure that that injustice was eliminated. All claimants accused of receiving excess benefits after that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I1035">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1029</span>
date would be treated equally, which is not the case in relation to 26 February. All claimants accused before that date would be subject to the previous regime. There are cases—and always have been, I presume—involving people who genuinely do not have the means to pay. Such people would say that they were bankrupt or that they would be if the claim were enforced. The amounts would therefore have to be written off, which would be part of the continuation of the previous regime. There should not be a nefarious, and crazy, distinction that works against those who are honest and good enough to pay up on demand and in favour of those who do not.<br><br>
The Minister did not want to take advice from me, but might have taken advice from his hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Joan Humble <span class='memberconstituency'>(Blackpool, North and Fleetwood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: And Fleetwood.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is very important—it is where the fish comes from. We heard this morning that the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble) worked for the Inland Revenue earlier in her life. It is a fine institution to work for—it has fine standards, which are much better than those of this Government. The position of the Inland Revenue is that a taxpayer who pays it an excess amount of money will receive a credit or have it set off against another liability. If I calculate my tax in a way that is not in my interest—if I pay too much money or if I pay too rapidly—I will receive credit for it. If I delay and refuse to pay money that is due, I will be penalised. That is a fair system; it is the opposite of the system that the Under-Secretary wants to introduce in new clause 12.<br><br>
People who pay up should be given credit, not be penalised. If they are penalised, the principle of good citizenship and fair dealing between the citizen and the state is undermined. The citizen will therefore conclude that if the state has a reasonable liability on him, it is in his interest to resist it—by fair means and foul—for as long as possible, given the cuckoo and crackpot values on which the new Labour Government's policies are based.<br><br>
I find myself in a quandary. Conservative Members are in favour of relieving liabilities to pay back excess amounts of disability-related benefit received in periods before the reclassification of an individual's entitlement. That is a sensible principle. As I said on the Floor of the House, it does not make the slightest sense, in reason or fairness, to say to somebody whose condition may be steadily improving, "You were probably improving before the date of the review or your last medical examination. We'll fix some arbitrary date—perhaps 29 July last year—and we'll say that you improved from that point." That does not make any sense. It is sensible to suggest that no benefit should be repaid in respect of the period before the review at which the entitlement was reassessed and redetermined. We support that principle, and my instinct is to vote for the new clause and to urge my hon. Friends to do likewise. However, the Government have, either through ill-will or incompetence, drafted that perfectly sensible provision so that it contains unnecessary, damaging and unjust proposals.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1030</span>
4.45 pm<br><br>
The true nature of the new clause emerged only after my questioning this morning—I had to intervene three times to get a proper answer from the Under-Secretary. It was not possible to anticipate this situation earlier, and we are in a quandary that we must resolve. I propose to do so by supporting the new clause because it will deliver an objective that we seriously desire. However, I place on the record, with the help of the <i>Hansard</i> writer, our reservation about, and our feeling of revulsion at, the Government's approach, which will penalise the most honest people and reward those whose dealings may not be dishonest but which are not marked by the same degree of selflessness and social responsibility. My strictures may have brought about private regret among Labour Members, although machismo may prevent them from acknowledging that in Committee. If so, our debate will have been worth while, and I hope that we hear no more of this nonsense. The Government's proposal is another example of the moral perversity that appears far too frequently in the Bill.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The new clause will give effect to new schedule 1. The amendments that you grouped with it, Mr. Malins, deal with various issues relating to the Social
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1032</span>
Security Contributions (Transfer of Functions, etc) Act 1999. You will be familiar with that Act, Mr. Malins, because you and Mr. McWilliam were the Chairman of the Committee that considered that piece of legislation some weeks ago. Several Committee members also sat on that Committee. When that legislation reached its Report stage, my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury explained that any corrections that it needed would be made in amendments to the Bill that we are considering. We have now reached that point. We have identified a small number of technical errors and omissions. Those minor points, which are immaterial to the effect of the Act, are picked up in new schedule 1, which has 32 paragraphs.<br><br>
The Government amendments will ensure that the references and numbering are correct, that the transferred functions are treated consistently and that all consequential changes are picked up. None of those corrections affects the exercise of the functions as at 1 April.<br><br>
I shall not discuss all 32 paragraphs in new schedule 1, but Committee members may be interested in a couple of points. First, paragraph 24 deals with a point that was raised on Report by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies). He may well derive some innocent, well-deserved pleasure from that fact. The correction puts beyond all doubt the Inland Revenue's ability to collect national insurance contribution debts in the civil courts, on which the Bill's original wording cast doubt.<br><br>
Secondly, paragraphs 7 and 8 of the new schedule make it clear that the Inland Revenue can pass information held mainly in relation to the contracting-out of the state earnings-related pension scheme to the Benefits Agency for social security and other purposes and, conversely, that the Benefits Agency can pass information—particularly information on SERPS—about social security and other matters to the Revenue for contracting-out purposes. That is not a new practice. In the past, specific powers were not needed for that transfer because the Department of Social Security could share information within the Department. However, the provision is now needed to regularise matters because the contracting-out functions have transferred to the Revenue.<br><br>
Finally, paragraph 18 will extend slightly the power to make regulations concerning decisions on contracting-out matters. The original power permitted such regulations to cover revision and supersession of such decisions, but not first instance decisions. Paragraphs 18 makes it clear that those regulations can cover general matters relating to such decisions.<br><br>
I should be happy to answer any questions on new schedule 1. The grouping is large, in part because, as we have found on a couple of occasions, the amendments will affect legislation in Great Britain and Northern Ireland and therefore have to be replicated. They are almost entirely technical and I hope that the Committee will support them.</span></p>

HABITUAL RESIDENCE TEST</div> <!-- title -->

<br><blockquote><p>"so, however, that regulations may not treat a person who is in Great Britain and who has the right to live in Great Britain for the time being without immigration leave as not being in Great Britain irrespective of where he is habitually or ordinarily resident".'.—[<i>Mr. Rendel.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Rendel <span class='memberconstituency'>(Newbury)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br><br>
I am delighted to introduce the clause. Before discussing it, I should say that my colleagues and I have discussed whether the word, "whether" should replace the word, "where" near the end of the clause. The two words mean much the same thing in this context. The Government may want to accept the clause, but may prefer "whether" to "where". If so, I should be delighted to accept an amendment to that effect on Report, provided that the clause is incorporated into the Bill today, as I hope that it will be.<br><br>
Following the Swaddling judgment, the Government said that they would produce new proposals on the habitual residence test which, as it was then conducted, was deemed contrary to European law. I am happy to say that such new proposals are formulated in the clause and I hope that the Government will choose to adopt them. Since the Swaddling judgment, the Government have introduced new guidelines for adjudication officers on how the tests should be put into practice. I shall bring those to the Committee's attention to argue why they are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1034</span>
not sufficient. The new guidelines say that a claimant of income-based jobseeker's allowance or income support of any nationality who,
<br><blockquote><p>"1. was previously habitually resident in the UK and</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>2. moved and lived in another country and</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>3. returns to resume their previous residence</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>is habitually resident immediately on arrival in the UK."</p></blockquote>
That helps to overcome some of the problems with the habitual residence test, but certainly not all of them. The guidelines add:
<br><blockquote><p>"In deciding the habitual residence question the AO should take account of the length and continuity of the previous residence in the UKand whether the claimant has sufficient links with that previous residence to be regarded as picking up the pieces of their old life."</p></blockquote>
It is still relevant to include the new clause, which goes beyond the current guidelines because some groups of people who clearly should receive benefit are still likely to be refused benefit under the test. For example, those people who might be likely to fail the habitual residence test immediately on arrival, even after the change in the guidelines, would include someone who left the country as a young child and did not have the chance to establish habitual residence, perhaps because he or she was taken abroad by parents who then died, moved on or retired back to this country when the child had grown up.<br><br>
If such a person returned to this country as an adult, believing that he or she was a citizen of this country, and was totally reliant on the state immediately after returning here, it would seem reasonable, logical and fair that he or she should be supported. One might think that the fact that such people were not working in this country when they were young should not be especially relevant to the case because, according to natural justice, they should not be excluded. However, it seems that, under the new guidelines, such a person would be excluded.<br><br>
That is one example of a case where one might wish to go beyond the current guidelines, but there are similar cases—for example, where people have grown up in this country and had a period of habitual residence here when they were young, but have moved away and sold their houses. Their friends and family move away and they may have nowhere in particular to return to, but having been abroad for some time, and perhaps having met with some misfortune and been made redundant in another part of the world, they come back to this country an find that because they cannot be said to be picking up the pieces of their old lives, they fail the habitual residence test, even under the new guidelines.<br><br>
So there are groups of people whom we would like to include among those who have the rights to benefits, but we cannot do so under the current guidelines—even the new guidelines produced since the Swaddling judgment.<br><br>
Some people might ask what is wrong with the habitual residence test and why we need to change it to include more people. There are clear reasons for that, which are widely supported in all parts of the House, as I hope to demonstrate. The habitual residence test was first introduced on 1 August 1994 to overcome the problems of what was known as benefit tourism, whereby people of other nationalities might come to Britain hoping to take advantage of our welfare system. Clearly, we do not want people to take advantage of our system who have no right
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I1038">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1035</span>
to benefit from it. At the same time, the test seems to have extended beyond that group and to have excluded from benefits some people whom we would regard as vulnerable, who should have the right to claim benefits in this country and who should not have been excluded as a result of the test.<br><br>
Interestingly, the Labour party opposed the change when it was introduced. In fact, when it was introduced in 1994, early-day motion 311 tabled by the Under-Secretary, no less, called for the abolition of the test. The early-day motion stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"That this House is deeply concerned about the effects of the habitual residence test on both British citizens and those with right of abode returning to the United Kingdom; notes that the test is being used to prevent vulnerable people from claiming benefits, for example, a young mother and her 10-month-old baby now residing in York who had recently returned from Cyprus to live in the United Kingdom; and calls upon the Government to abolish this test immediately."</p></blockquote>
That early-day motion was supported by Liberal Democrat Members and Labour Members, and possibly by some Conservatives too. The Minister of State was among its supporters. Therefore, we have good support for the abolition of the habitual residence test.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eric Pickles <span class='memberconstituency'>(Brentwood and Ongar)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It looks like the hon. Gentleman is on a winner here.</span></p>
<p>5 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rendel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. I hope to find good support from the Government for my proposal, as it is clearly in line with proposals that they have made fairly recently.<br><br>
In a debate on the uprating regulations on 28 February 1995, another Labour Member, the hon. Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Bradley), who was previously also a Social Security Minister, said that the test was a blunt instrument being used to correct a specific problem. He commented that
<br><blockquote><p>"The Government's proposals may take a sledgehammer to crack a nut,"—</p></blockquote>
I think that is absolutely right
<br><blockquote><p>"and the original objective of the habitual residence test may have been achieved at the expense of the welfare of many British and there nationals who have come to or returned to the United Kingdom to settle."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 28 February 12995; Vol. 255, c. 867.]</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Withington was right to say that. It is interesting that two Ministers and one ex-Minister seem to support the aim of the new clause. He went on to say that the aim of preventing benefit tourism might be laudable, but many vulnerable parties were being affected by what he described as this "sledgehammer".<br><br>
The present Minister of State also recognised the problem. He had two Adjournment debates on the subject. In the second of those, on 29 April 1996, he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"it soon became obvious that, whatever its original intention, the test was reaching well beyond the scope of benefit tourism."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 29 April 1996; Vol. 276, c. 877.]</p></blockquote>
He further commented:
<br><blockquote><p>"The worst aspect of the test is that it often hits people who are already facing a crisis."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 29 April 1996; Vol. 276, c. 878.]</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1036</span>
That is an important aspect of the test. As in one of my earlier examples, someone might have returned from abroad, having been made redundant and facing a difficult period in his or her life, and might then be unable to obtain any form of income.<br><br>
Another well known Labour Member, the hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Ms Jackson), called for
<br><blockquote><p>"an early debate on the grievous effect of the Government's noxious habitual residence test and its impact on British",</p></blockquote>
citizens,
<br><blockquote><p>"and United Kingdom nationals".—[<i>Official Report,</i> 15 February 1996; Vol. 271, c. 1167.]</p></blockquote>
We therefore have good support all round on this matter.<br><br>
As well as being a blunt instrument—a sledgehammer being used to crack a nut—the test is a poorly defined instrument and as such it can often become an administrative nightmare. The vagaries of interpretation of the test have led to inconsistent application. The hon. Member for Withington commented, in a debate after the introduction of the test:
<br><blockquote><p>"In practice, the test is proving arbitrary, subjective, complex and unfair. As there is no definition of habitual residence, several imprecise and, arguably, inappropriate criteria are used to establish residence."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 28 February 1995; Vol. 255, c. 868.]</p></blockquote>
The Social Security Advisory Committee was asked to comment on the introduction of the test before it was introduced. In the Secretary of State's response to its review of the test regulations, it was reported as regarding the test as subjective and difficult to apply with any degree of accuracy.<br><br>
The test is a blunt and ill-defined instrument, but it is its inherent unfairness that most prompts our call in the new clause for its abolition. We reiterate the call that many have made before us. The Government's own Social Security Advisory Committee has opposed it, and the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux highlighted its flaws and called for it to be opposed in its 1996 report. The Child Poverty Action Group supported the case before the European courts and my noble Friend Earl Russell supported it in the other place. In 1996, the hon. Member for East Ham, the Minister of State, wound up his second Adjournment debate on the test by commenting
<br><blockquote><p>"I hope that the habitual residence test will be scrapped".—[<i>Official Report,</i> 29 April 1996; Vol. 276, c. 880.]</p></blockquote>
He has the opportunity to scrap it through the new clause today.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel) correctly identified, the matter is close to my heart and that of my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, many Labour Members and others who are listening to our debate. I commend him on the thoroughness of his research and I am pleased that my two Adjournment debates have resurfaced.<br><br>
It is because of the widespread concern that we set up the review of the habitual residence test that is in hand and why we are considering the scope for reform. The hon. Gentleman correctly pinpointed one of the major problems with the operation of the test—its effect on returning United Kingdom nationals. The figures for the previous financial year show that more than half—
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I1039">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1037</span>
57 per cent.—of those affected by the habitual residence test are United Kingdom nationals and that is the centre of our concern in carrying out the review.<br><br>
Concern was expressed, not so much by the hon. Gentleman but by others, that the review seems to have taken rather longer than anticipated because of the need to take account of all the relevant evidence, including the outcome of the litigation and the case of Mr. Robin Swaddling, which may have a significant impact on the scope for reform. The outcome of that case has been helpful.<br><br>
The European Court of Justice recently gave its judgment and decided that consideration of an "appreciable period" of residence in the United Kingdom should not be a deciding factor in determining habitual residence for people returning to this country to pick up their previous ties. That helpfully deals with a large part of the difficulty with the test to which we have drawn attention. It is merely one factor among many in determining whether someone is habitually resident and its importance will vary according to the circumstances of each case.<br><br>
Therefore, we have recently issued guidance to staff administering the test to explain the position ahead of introducing our recommendations for the future of the test, which we shall do soon. I am sure that hon. Members are looking forward to the results of those deliberations.<br><br>
I hope that it will not be too vain if I draw attention briefly to something else that I said in my Adjournment debates in 1996. The Committee knows that I have a sympathetic nature and I said that
<br><blockquote><p>"it is easy to feel sympathy for the Secretary of State"—</p></blockquote>
who was then the right hon. Member for St. Albans and is now the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley)—
<br><blockquote><p>"who had identified a problem that required a solution. Benefit tourism certainly was not the largest fraud in the social security system—indeed, it had never satisfactorily been quantified—but it was an undesirable phenomenon."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 29 April 1996; Vol. 276, c. 877.]</p></blockquote>
That difficulty remains. As the hon. Member for Newbury said, None of us condones benefit tourism. People from other parts of the European Union should not be able to holiday in the UK at the expense of the Benefits Agency. The tricky task is to ensure that such abuse is excluded through regulation, without preventing those who should have access to the benefits system from having such access. Several such people were identified by the hon. Member for Newbury when he moved the new clause. We are continuing to take on that tricky task and I hope that we will be able to make an announcement soon.<br><br>
Finally, I should point out that, as drafted, the clause is technically defective and would not have the effect that the hon. Member for Newbury seeks. On a more substantive point, I am not sure that it is permissible in EU law to refer, as the clause does, to
<br><blockquote><p>"a person…who has the right to live in Great Britain".</p></blockquote>
EU law might view such a reference as discriminatory against those who live in other EU countries.<br><br>
How do we ensure access to the benefits system for those whom all of us would agree should have such access, while preventing access by those who may be holidaying in the UK? That is the nub of the problem with
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1038</span>
which we are dealing and about which, as I said, we hope to make an announcement soon. We support the wide concerns that have been expressed about the way in which the habitual residence test has operated. That test has been improved through guidance issued recently and we shall make a further announcement in due course. In the light of such assurances, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw the new clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rendel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his response, but I am afraid that it is not entirely satisfactory. He seems to agree that the law needs to be changed and accepts that the review has taken a long time. He also agreed that, if some aspects of the new clause—one of which I mentioned during my opening remarks—were tweaked, it would comply with EU regulations. However, he failed to give a good reason why such a clause should not be incorporated into the Bill. Had he guaranteed that he would insert such a clause on Report, I might have agreed that it should not be inserted at this stage.<br><br>
If the Government were to incorporate the clause and, where necessary, to tweak it on Report, the Committee's wish effectively to reduce the habitual residence test would be made clear. Therefore, I see no reason why the clause should not be put to a vote.</span></p>

<br><blockquote><p>(1D) In subsections (1A) to (1B) above, "severely disabled persons" means persons who are in receipt of the care component of disability living allowance at the highest rate within section (4)(a) of section 72 above.".'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p>5.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oaten</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I feel embarrassed and inadequate. I have no adjournment debate, early-day motions or—given what has happened previously—decent researcher to refer to. I want to probe the meaning of the disability income guarantee, about which the Government have spoken on a number of occasions during the Committee's proceedings. It has been welcomed by many groups and has quite a lot of power behind it as a result. I want to clarify whether it will cover the groups that I would hope the Government would recognised should be covered.<br><br>
The aim of the disability income guarantee is to provide additional support to severely disabled people under the age of 60 who are receiving a form of income support. Defining what is meant by severely disabled people is one of the difficulties. My understanding is that the Government intend severely disabled to apply to those on the higher rate care component within income support. Typically, that will mean those who need and receive some kind of support for care during the night. The Government have used that as a measure of severe disablement, although it excludes a number of groups.<br><br>
I intend to probe the Government's reasoning for excluding those over 60 from receiving the disability income guarantee. I know that the Government have introduced measures for a minimum income guarantee for pensioners in poverty, which is a welcome acknowledgement of the difficulties that are felt acutely by such pensioners. What is not clear is whether the Government have acknowledged that pensioners in poverty who are disabled have additional needs and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1040</span>
concerns. Those do not appear to have been covered by the disability income guarantee. I would be grateful if the Minister would consider how that group of individuals can be helped.<br><br>
New clause 7 considers an additional group of individuals who will not necessarily receive the disability income guarantee. As I mentioned, the premium is paid through income support, but only to those individuals who are on the higher rate. Those under the age of 25 are paid income support not at the higher but at the lower rate. How can the disability income guarantee therefore benefit those under the age of 25? The impression given is that the guarantee is available to everyone under the age of 60. If the mechanism for triggering the guarantee is to be believed, those under the age of 25 will not benefit.<br><br>
The guarantee does not appear to be available to a couple of other groups of individuals. Will the Minister clarity whether it will be available to those with some form of lifetime savings? Do the Government have any plans to consider what thresholds might apply? The Government should consider that matter in the light of previous debates about encouraging people to save. The second group is composed of individuals whom most hon. Members would describe as severely disabled, but who are not receiving the higher rate that would trigger the disability income guarantee. Some individuals who are blind do not need care at night, which is the criteria for receiving the severe care award, but are clearly severely disabled and need some sort of support. There is a loophole in the Government's proposals for the disability income guarantee because such individuals will not receive the support that they should.<br><br>
I am worried that the Government are portraying the income guarantee as the answer to many of the concerns that have been raised by members of the Committee. Time and again, when we have queried the abolition of certain benefits, Ministers have referred to the income guarantee. When one examines the mechanics for achieving the guarantee, one finds that those who are over 60, those under 25 and those who are severely disabled but not on the higher rate will not receive the support that Ministers have implied they will receive. I should be grateful if the Under-Secretary could confirm whether my assumptions are accurate and say whether the Government are prepared to reconsider such loopholes to ensure that the guarantee is really a guarantee for those people, who need support. These are probing new clauses, but we hope that the Government will recognise that there are loopholes in the income guarantee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In introducing the new clauses, the hon. Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten) explained that he was probing and trying to discover what the Government's real intentions were in two regards.<br><br>
The new clauses intend to place on Government a statutory requirement to consult organisations that represent severely disabled people about the level of benefits. In addition, the income support personal allowance would be increased for severely disabled people under 25 to the level for people aged 25 and over.<br><br>
The Government already consult organisations that represent disabled people. Indeed, when the Prime Minister launched our welfare reform programme, he
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I1041">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1041</span>
promised that there would be consultation and time for discussion at every stage. We have kept that pledge. Last year, we set up a new disability benefits forum, which we discussed this morning. The forum was set up to seek views on the Government's disability reform proposals, including the new disability income guarantee. So we are already making sure that, through the guarantee, we provide benefits at a level that provides real support for disabled people.<br><br>
The new guarantee will be introduced in April 2001 and will provide extra help and security for the poorest disabled people with the highest care needs. It will provide help through the income-related benefits to severely disabled people and families with disabled children who receive the highest rate care component of DLA. About 145,000 adults and 30,000 families with disabled children will benefit from the disability income guarantee at a cost of about £60 million in its first year. That is one of the reasons why our package of changes to the disability benefits system will increase Government costs in the year in which it is introduced.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Winchester asked about people with savings who do not qualify for income support. Large numbers of disabled people wil benefit from the disability income guarantee, but it is intended for the poorest disabled people with the highest care needs. One cannot say that those people who have savings such that they do not qualify for income support are the poorest disabled people.<br><br>
The extra support will be paid through a new higher rate of disability premium. At April 1998 rates, it will be worth an extra £5.75 a week for a single adult or child and £8.30 for a couple. Indeed, the disability income guarantee is one of those measures that would be lost to disabled people as a result of the Conservative party's two strictures: to retain the status quo for incapacity benefit while, at the same time, not significantly increasing expenditure on benefits for disabled people. The Conservative party cannot have it both ways: it cannot support those two strictures and hope to find £60 million to introduce the disability income guarantee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are not trying to have it both ways—we do not support any of those extensions of means-tested benefits. We believe that such benefits are fundamentally misconceived.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In which case, I take back my suggestion. The Conservative party clearly does not want to have it both ways. The hon. Gentleman made it clear that it does not support the introduction of the disability income guarantee.<br><br>
The guarantee and other aspects of our welfare reform programme show that the Government listen to the views and concerns of disabled people. We have responded with a range of measures that will make a real and tangible difference to their lives.<br><br>
Our measures will provide more help to those who need it most. Those people will be better able to live independently and with dignity. Although the Conservative party does not support the income disability guarantee, that proposal has been widely welcomed.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1042</span>
However, we recognise that there has been some concern about its impact on younger age groups. I shall respond to that concern, which was brought to the Committee's attention by the hon. Member for Winchester.<br><br>
I assure the hon. Gentleman that younger people will get the new premium, so long as they get a higher rate care component of DLA. The overall weekly amount that is payable will, of course, depend on their individual circumstances, their age, whether they have a partner, their savings and so on. That is always the case in an income-related benefit. The premium—the additional £5.75 for a single adult and £8.30 for a couple—will apply to people who are under the age of 25.<br><br>
Younger people have a lower rate of benefit because the majority of them live in someone else's household and have fewer financial responsibilities. That rate also reflects the lower earnings expectations of younger people. It would be wrong for benefit levels to offer an alternative to seeking work or training, or an incentive to leave home. We do not think that an increase in weekly benefit along the lines suggested in the new clause would be a sensible use of resources, particularly because we are already giving that group significant additional support through the guarantee.<br><br>
The fact that the disability income guarantee is aimed at people who are under 60 does not mean that people over pension age are being overlooked. We are committed to tackling poverty among pensioners, and from this month we are introducing a minimum income guarantee for pensioners. In addition, as my right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced in his Budget, the winter fuel payment will be increased to £100 per year for all pensioner households. We are responding positively to the needs of the poorest pensioners in a way that makes the new clause 6 redundant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oaten</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The measures that the Minister outlined appear to be for pensioners across the board. What measures do the Government have for disabled pensioners, who have specific needs in addition to those of pensioners in poverty, which he discussed?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They will be means-tested.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must recognise that the additional costs of disability, which disabled people face, are recognised in the DLA, not in the minimum income guarantee for pensioners or in the disability income guarantee. Those two guarantees are paid through income support. That is why the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford said, from a sedentary position, that he will have no truck with improvements in means-tested benefits and that he does not believe in the means-tested safety net. I know that the Liberal Democrats agree with the Government about the fact that more help is needed for the poorest people, including the poorest disabled people and pensioners. It is appropriate to apply that help through the means-tested benefit from which the poorest disabled people and the poorest pensioners benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rendel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary suggested that the Liberal Democrats entirely agree with the Government on this matter. I should have thought that the situation was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I1042">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1043</span>
clear by now. We have long argued that the poorest pensioners are those who are not on means-tested benefits. For one reason or another, they do not receive income support. They need a non-means-tested benefit increase, and it is our policy to achieve that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly cannot speak for the Liberal Democrats—the hon. Gentleman made it clear that he has reservations about applying the MIG for pensioners. However, I can speak for the Government and for my party. We believe that the benefits system needs to be reformed to provide more support for the poorest pensioners and the poorest disabled people.</span></p>
<p>5.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rendel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Under-Secretary accept that the MIG does not get through to the poorest pensioners who are not on income support, although they are below income support income levels?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's point avoids the question, which is, how does one get benefits to the poorest people? We are taking action to get benefits to those people. The only answer that the hon. Gentleman has is to provide an uprating in benefits to rich and poor alike, but less money would go into the pockets of the poor because the rich would get more. The Government are firm in their view, which is that the living standards of the poorest pensioners and the poorest disabled people are too low. We are dealing with that problem.<br><br>
The final requirement of the new clauses that were moved by the hon. Member for Winchester would be that benefit levels were uprated in line with prices. However, what could be more unnecessary and cumbersome than to include in the Bill—in primary legislation—an obligation to require the Government to do what we are already doing? Indeed, we are going further. The Chancellor announced that the MIG for pensioners will be uprated in line, not with prices but with average earnings in April 2000.</span></p>
<p>[MR. JOHN MCWILLIAM <i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
<p>With that in mind—we should remember that there is no such requirement on other income-related benefits—I see no need for this extra legislative burden.</p>
<p>The hon. Member for Winchester suggested that new clause 6 will also require the Government to set the level of benefit for pensioners so that it combines the effect of the disability income guarantee and the MIG. The minimum income guarantee already provides for the whole range of premiums to be paid in relation to age and disability. Increasing benefit levels on the lines suggested would not be a good use of resources, particularly, as both guarantees already provide such significant additional help.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I do not believe that we need the new clauses, and I urge the Committee to reject them.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oaten</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We tabled the new clauses to encourage the Government to say more about the guarantee and we have heard more about it. Despite the Under-Secretary's
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1044</span>
various caveats, it will not necessarily cover pensioners, those who are under 25, those with considerable savings or those who fall into the category of people who need help and support but who do not qualify for the higher rate because they do not need night care support, although they need some support and back-up. The Under-Secretary failed to answer my questions about those people and about the blind person who is severely disabled but who does not qualify for the benefits that would trigger the guarantee because he does not need night care support, which appears to be the trigger in those circumstances.<br><br>
In our debate we have probed and heard more from the Under-Secretary. I think that I should take some comfort from his remarks about the under-25s, although it remains unclear whether they could access the income guarantee.<br><br>
I hope that the Under-Secretary will put my mind at rest on two matters. First, will someone who is under 25 be able to get the income guarantee? Secondly, do the Government intend to exclude blind people who are not on the higher rate? Is there a way to extend the guarantee to severely disabled people who do not qualify for the higher rate?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the first point, the Government regard the higher rate care component as a passport to the disability income guarantee. Those people who do not qualify for the higher rate care component will not qualify for the disability income guarantee.<br><br>
I can perhaps give a more helpful response to the hon. Gentleman's second point and make it clear that adults and children under 25 will qualify for the disability income guarantee. That is a higher rate disability premium paid through income support, which, at April 1998 prices, provides £5.75 for a single adult or child and £8.30 for a couple. That will be payable to those who qualify because they are on the higher rate care component in addition to the income support that they otherwise receive.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oaten</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for that clarification. I think that he is saying that only those under-25s who are currently on the higher rate will be able to access the income guarantee. I should be interested to know how many under-25s are on the higher rate because I suspect that it is not many. It could be a problem for the under-25 group if very few fall into that category. No doubt I can table a parliamentary question to establish the figure.<br><br>
I shall move on to the second issue of the higher rate being the trigger. I understand that, administratively, that is the only effective way to do this, but does the Minister acknowledge that there will be loopholes in the system? Some people who are severely disabled do not receive the higher rate because the sort of care that attracts the higher rate is not what they need, but they still have severe disabilities and specific requirements.<br><br>
Using the higher rate as the trigger for the income guarantee is not necessarily the most effective method. The Under-Secretary has not given me an assurance that those who fall through the loophole will have some way of accessing the guarantee. Clearly, we will not reach complete agreement on this matter, but we do not wish to press the new clause to a vote.</span></p>

New clause 8</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
TAX DEDUCTIBLE PENSION PROVISIONS</div> <!-- title -->
<p>'The Inland Revenue notes in relation to pensions shall be applied in such a way that no amount lost to a person's pension assets by means of a pension sharing arrangement or order shall be taken into account in such a way as to limit his entitlement to make tax deductible pension provisions in the future.'.—[<i>Mr. Quentin Davies.</i>]</p>
<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br><br>
This is another matter of elementary fairness. The purpose of new clause 8 is to ensure that the tax rules applied to those who have suffered a pension split are the same as those applied to people who have benefited from one.<br><br>
In earlier debates, we expressed our reservations about the course on which the Government have launched with pension splitting. We said that if this new instrument was to be available to the courts at all, it should be available as a last resort. Unfortunately, we lost that argument. Our concern is that if pension splitting is to form a regular part of the criteria applied by the courts in the splitting of assets and liabilities on divorce, it should be applied even-handedly. We must not create a situation in which the party who gains a share of someone else's pension on divorce also benefits from a better tax regime, which enables him or her to accumulate future pension assets on more favourable terms, or to a greater extent, or on more liberal criteria than the party who has lost a share of his or her pension.<br><br>
I must insist on using the cumbersome term "him or her" because, although we know that in most cases—it will be a quantitative fact—it will be the man who will lose a share of his pension and the woman who will gain one, there will be many situations in which the woman loses and her former husband gains part of the pension that she has earned.<br><br>
The Opposition entirely reject sexist rhetoric. We reject extreme feminism, as we would also reject its obverse if it were articulated. However, it has not been articulated during our debates. We are arguing for equal rights, even-handedness and—in short—justice.<br><br>
Clearly, our arguments must have had some impact. When we discussed the clauses on pension splitting, the Government were not at all at ease, and came up with what they described as a concession. I expect that the Minister of State, who has in his hand a piece of paper, is about to retail the same so-called concession which, as I recall it, was that members of occupational pension schemes who, as part of the pension split, lose part of their entitlement to a pension, will be entitled to rebuild their rights in the occupational pension scheme, provided
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1046</span>
that they do so from a salary of not more than £22,000 a year. That was the extraordinarily arbitrary figure given by the Minister of State.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was £22,650.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Oh, it was £22,650.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I also recall that the figure was £22,650, but we must get to the meat of the new clause, which is the way in which the Inland Revenue deals with the capital remaining after pension splitting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, Mr. McWilliam. On the one side, we have the Bill's proposals, which the Government have promised to modify by introducing this so-called concession, which is limited to people on a salary of not more than £22,650. You have a much better memory than me, Mr. McWilliam, so you remembered the extra £650. Had the extra sum been £654.62, I do not doubt that you would have remembered that too. However, I regard the precision implied by the figure of £22,650 as somewhat spurious, for reasons that I shall give in a moment.<br><br>
That is one offer that the Government have put on the table. I trust that I shall be allowed to contrast it with our alternative proposal, which is contained in new clause 8. New clause 8 would provide fairness: there would be no such arbitrary limits, and the rules that apply to one party would, by definition, be applied to the other. I sometimes wonder—as I did during our debate on new clause 12—whether the Government understand the meaning of the word "fairness". Perhaps they do not, but we do. Fairness is a principle that is enshrined in new clause 8—a clear concept couched in straightforward language.<br><br>
In my view, there is no justification for imposing a particular tax regime on one party and another regime on the other. Perhaps the Government have decided to impose on beneficiaries of splits a tax regime that is more favourable than that imposed on losers because the beneficiaries are likely to be women, and because doing so will enable the kind of feminist rhetoric on which the previous Secretary of State for Social Security was particularly keen. If so, that is a disgraceful reason, which we do not accept, for breaching the fundamental principle of even-handedness.<br><br>
I do not accept the provision; nor do I accept the so-called concession of the £22,650 limit, which the Minister of State is doubtless about to repeat. That limit is no solution because it remains discriminatory. If it were £222,547, or another figure, it would still be discriminatory, because a limit would still have been set on the extent to which a person who lost a share of his or her pension was able to rebuild it. By way of contrast, the person who gained by the split could, without limit, build up other pension rights within existing Inland Revenue rules. The beneficiary of a pension split could receive the bonus of the pension split on top of the maximum pension entitlement, whether from an existing or subsequently acquired occupational or personal pension. That is fundamentally unfair. The new clause would reject any discrimination. It is not a matter of £22,650 or any other figure. Even a multiple of 10 times that would not satisfy me because it would be unjust and discriminatory.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I1044">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1047</span>
There is a practical reason for the choice of £22,650 being so insulting to people for whom the measure is ostensibly designed. After an expensive divorce, it is a major disaster if a significant share of a pension fund, which may have been accumulated over many years by hard work, is lost. The question is whether someone will be able to rebuild it from future savings from income.<br><br>
5.45 pm<br><br>
We all know that the lower our income, the more difficult it is to save from it. It is a fact of economic theory that the propensity to save is a positive function of income, but it is a fact of common sense that those with more disposable income have a greater ability to save from it. Those with a lower disposable income have little left when they have met their immediate needs for accommodation, food and so on, so they cannot save much.<br><br>
It is particularly cruel for the Government to set a salary limit up to which it will be possible to rebuild a pension fund, when that limit happens to be close to the present average income from full-time male employment in this country. Only when people's incomes are above average do they tend to be able to save more than the average amount or even to save at all. Only people who are earning more than average will ever be able to take advantage of the opportunity to rebuild.<br><br>
The effect of the Government's so-called concession is to tell people, "If your income is below £22,000, or whatever it is, you will be able to rebuild, but if you have a bit more money you will not be able to rebuild." That is tantamount to saying, "If you are financially able to rebuild, we shall prevent you from doing so, and if you are financially unable to rebuild, you will be allowed to do so." That is insulting to the intelligence—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We have had a lot of "yous". Although I could happily regale the Committee with my financial position, that does not arise from the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. McWilliam, but I have not been able to find an ingenious way of involving your financial affairs. I am sure that they would be more entertaining than the new clause.<br><br>
First, the Government's proposal is inherently unfair because it is discriminatory. Secondly, it adds insult to injury to tell people that the Government are arbitrarily choosing a level of income below which it will be possible for the loser of a pension split to rebuild a pension fund, when it is such that they will almost certainly be unable to take full advantage of that and many will be unable to take any advantage of it. Most cruelly, those whose incomes from time to time rise above the average male level of £22,000 or thereabouts will not be able to rebuild their pension at the precise moment when their incomes are high because they will be disbarred by the limit.<br><br>
Thirdly, the proposal makes no financial sense if the Government are sincere when they tell the public and Parliament that they want to encourage greater savings, especially in the form of pensions. Good social and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1048</span>
economic arguments exist for encouraging people to save in such a long-term and therefore illiquid fashion, but those arguments will be defeated by this provision. Therefore, it makes no financial, moral or common sense. We should be rid of it and replace it with one that does make sense. I urge the Committee to vote for new clause 8.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Committee members will recall that Conservative Members put forward two kinds of proposals on pension sharing. The Gainsborough amendment tried to restrict, minimise and—if possible—stop, while the Beckenham amendment tried to make it easier, more generous and more flexible. I deduced from the new clause that the hon. Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait) prevailed in the fierce strife among Conservative Members on such matters. Having heard the speech by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford, I am not sure what is being proposed.<br><br>
The essential problem with the new clause is that it would put people who had been through a divorce in a more favourable tax position that other scheme members, which would be fiercely resisted by the hon. Member for Gaisnborough (Mr. Leigh) and the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) if they were here.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is why they are not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman pre-empts my next comment—that may be why they are not in the Room.<br><br>
People who had been through a divorce would be able to rebuild fully, even if that were to take the total benefits—including the portion given to the former spouse—beyond normal tax limits. As all Committee members would acknowledge, that would be unfair. It would add to Inland Revenue cost and lead to pressures for the levelling up of tax reliefs or even the abolition of the tax limits altogether. Some people would undoubtedly present it as an incentive to divorce. It would lead to pressure for the sharing of pensions by all married couples, which would cost about £600 million a year.<br><br>
The original Government proposal last summer was that the rebuilding of the member's lost pension rights should be subject to the usual contribution limits for occupational or personal pension schemes. In the case of occupational pension schemes, it was proposed that rebuilding should be permissible within the normal tax approval benefit limit appropriate to the original pension, taking into account the proportion given to the former spouse. That would have left the divorced scheme member with the same overall maximum benefit under the tax rules as all other scheme members. That was a fair proposal.<br><br>
Nevertheless, we listened carefully to the concerns expressed, which led to the announcement that I made to the Committee on 18 March. That proposal remains fair to other occupational scheme members, as it puts divorced members in much the same position as early leavers. It will enable occupational scheme members—other than company directors—whose pensions have been shared and whose annual earnings do not exceed 25 per cent. of the earnings cap at the time of divorce, to ignore the pension share when calculating their maximum benefit entitlement.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I1045">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1049</span>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford suggested that the figure of £22,650 a year was spurious. It is not; it is 25 per cent. of the earnings cap, which is £90,600 a year. We are therefore proposing that the same treatment should apply as applies to people who leave schemes early. I hope that that make sit clear where the figure comes from. The effect of ignoring the pension debit will be to provide more scope to pay additional contributions to rebuild.<br><br>
The effect of the amendment would be that all occupational pension scheme members would be free to rebuild their pension towards the maximum permitted within the 15 per cent. annual limit on employee contributions. However, the Government's view is that it is right to target the easement on those with modest incomes. I make no apology for that.</span></p>
<p>[MR. HUMFREY MALINS <i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
<p>As drafted, the amendment does not appear to help holders of personal pensions. If its purpose were to remove the contribution limits for such people, or the 15 per cent. limit for employee contributions to occupational pension schemes, the Government do not think that it would be right to create special tax reliefs for people whose pensions have been shared. That would be unfair to other pension scheme members including, for example, people who divorce but do not share their pension, and it would have potentially large Exchequer costs. I hope that, in the light of what I have said, the hon. Member will feel able to withdraw the new clause.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that we do not feel able to withdraw the new clause. What the Government have cooked up is not at all fair. It is monstrous that someone who has been forced under the Bill to hand over part of his or her pension should then be deemed still to have it for the purpose of calculating the revenue limits.<br><br>
That is bad enough, but it is even worse that the beneficiary of the pension—someone who has gained from another person's work record and pension rights—should then be allowed to receive it as a bonus, on top of whatever other rights to an accumulated pension he or she may have under the tax laws. I reject the argument that the new clause would create an incentive for people to divorce. The divorced couple should be treated as two separate individuals, which is what they are. They were separate individuals before they married and they should be considered as such after they divorce. That is what divorce means.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that the divorced couple would be treated more generously than if they had remained married?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clearly when people marry they take on a package of rights, obligations and benefits, although that package is being greatly altered. You would not like it, Mr. Malins, if I started talking about what has happened, for example, to the married man's allowance under the Labour Government.<br><br>
None the less, there ought to be a balance of advantages and disadvantages in the special regime of marriage into which some of us have entered. It provides a package of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1050</span>
benefits and obligations. It provides benefits and, I have to say, some disadvantages under the tax and benefit systems. People know that when they marry. When they divorce, they should no longer be considered married. They are not considered married for any other purpose and they should not be notionally considered married for the purpose of their pension. They may find themselves in the absurd situation suggested by the Minister, where they are not only deemed married for the purpose of their pension, but have already given away part of that pension to a former spouse.<br><br>
The Minister suggests that divorced people should be dealt with as though they were still married, otherwise it would be unfair to people who are married. By definition, if they are not married—either because they have never married, or because they have ceased to be married—they are single people and should be treated as such.<br><br>
Even if the Minister does not want that sensible and logical principle to be enshrined in the Bill, one would have hoped that he could have avoided discriminating between the two parties in a pension split. If he wants to impose a tax cost on people who divorce, he should at least say that the cost should be borne equally by both parties. It is unacceptable that the cost should be borne by one party, while the advantages are taken away by the other.<br><br>
Therefore, we cannot accept the Minister's invitation to withdraw the new clause, It is essential that it, or something like it, put into the Bill. I am prepared to accept that a more technically efficient clause could be drafted, given sufficient time and ingenuity. If that cannot happen here in Committee, I trust that it will happen on Report or in another place.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have spent two interesting months debating what is an extremely important Bill, which marks a turning point in the development of our welfare
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1070</span>
system. I think that I speak for all Committee members when I pay tribute to you, Mr. Malins, and to your colleague, Mr. McWilliam, for your able and good humoured chairmanship throughout our proceedings. This is the second time this year that I have had the opportunity so to thank you. On the first occasion, we reached the corresponding stage in our proceedings after midnight and I am pleased to say that we are not so late today.<br><br>
I thank my hon. Friends for their able and committed support. Opposition Committee members have sometimes criticised them for being quiet, but their support has certainly proved extremely effective and I am grateful for the keen interest that they have shown, not only in Committee but during informal discussions of the Bill. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, North (Mr. Hughes) for the efficient way in which he organised our sittings and ensured a good flow of information through the usual channels. It was not always clear whether some messages got much further than the other side of the Gangway, but my hon. Friend certainly did a splendid job and we are grateful to him.<br><br>
I am pleased that my right hon. Friend the Minister for Employment, Welfare to Work and Equal Opportunities was able to join us again today. I am grateful to him and my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Social Security for their persuasive arguments.<br><br>
I am also grateful to Opposition Members. We always enjoyed the vigorous contributions, theatrical cadences and dramatically claimed revelations of the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford, which added welcome colour to our proceedings. [HON. MEMBERS: "And to his cheeks."] That is a fair comment. I am also grateful to the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar for his rather more succinct contributions—a quality that Labour Committee members particularly appreciated. <i>[Laughter.]</i> His approach, which was gentler and more probing, was no less effective for that.<br><br>
We are also grateful to the hon. Member for Newbury and for Winchester for their focused and ifnormed contributions, which reflected fairly concerns expressed outside the House. My only disappointment is that, unlike on a previous occasion, I am unable to congratulate the hon. Member for Newbury for casting his vote in a shrewd manner throughout our proceedings. Sadly, he sometimes voted against the Government, but we are nevertheless grateful for his contributions.<br><br>
I want to thank the staff of the DSS and the DFEE, who have worked extremely hard throughout. I also thank parliamentary counsel, the Clerks, attendants, police officers and <i>Hansard,</i> whose staff had to struggle with our deliberations at certain points. I pay special tribute to Alastair Campbell, to whom unexpectedly frequent reference was made during Committee members's speeches.<br><br>
Finally, I thank you again, Mr. Malins, for guiding us with a sure hand to a successful conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friends and I would like to associate ourselves with the deserved and generous tribute that the Minister of State paid to you, Mr. Malins, and to your colleague, Mr. McWilliam. I extend that tribute to the deputies whom you and he occasionally called to your
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I1056">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1071</span>
Chair. The hon. Member for Colne Valley, for Chatham and Aylesford (Mr. Shaw), for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood and for High Peak (Mr. Levitt) presided over our proceedings with great confidence and charm and enabled us to make progress. As the Minister of State said, it has been something of a marathon. We have had eight weeks of constant work, with one week off for Easter. If I had served any longer under the chairmanship of Mr. McWilliam. I would have developed a nervous tick whenever I felt myself about to use the second person singular. I think I would have reached the point at which I would be addressing my wife and children as one, we, he, she or it. My experience on this Committee might have had permanent repercussions for my family and private life, although I think I have survived without that happening.<br><br>
6.15 pm<br><br>
You, Mr. Malins, and Mr. McWilliam have presided over our proceedings with great good humour and the necessary severity, although not too much to exclude a certain amount of colour and a certain amount of fun. We have covered fashions in the tie market, Cézanne, and other more alluring subjects than the minimum fund requirement or cash equivalent transfer values. I think that you and Mr. McWilliam had a particular problem in presiding over this Committee—I do not refer to presiding over myself, which I am sure is not at all difficult but a great pleasure. In addition to members of the Committee, two further personalities have played a part in our proceedings—Alastair Campbell, and the much more delectable figure of Lisa, from whom I hope we shall hear a great deal more in the future.<br><br>
I would like to second what was said in praise of all of those who have taken part in our proceedings. I should like to begin with my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar, who played an important part in our proceedings and shared the burden of speaking for the official Opposition. I also pay tribute to the hon. Member for Newbury and the hon. Member for Winchester, who made extremely well-researched and pertinent contributions. As a result of Conservative Members being less numerous in this Parliament than in the previous one, my hon. Friends on the Back Benches, who have had to play a large part in our proceedings than would often be the case. I thank the two Whips—the hon. Member for Doncaster, North and my hon. friend the Member for Beckenham—so much of whose work is necessarily invisible but contributes to the efficiency of our proceedings. I also thank Back-Bench Labour Members—we have enjoyed their role more when they have been participants than when they have been spectators, and I hope that they have also enjoyed it.<br><br>
I should like, not least, to thank the Minister of State, the Under-Secretary and the Minister for Employment, Welfare to Work and Equal Opportunities. They have come under a certain amount of fire from Opposition Members, but—perhaps to our disappointment—they have never lost their good humour and cool, nor their natural courtesy, which we admire and for which we are grateful. As a result, we have had some good debates.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1072</span>
I want to pay tribute to those who take part in our proceedings without speaking—the Clerk and his deputy, and also the police. It is easy to be pro-police in this House; indeed, it would be difficult and unforgivable not to be, as we are served by policemen—not too many policewomen, sadly—who display exemplary patience, courtesy and judgment. I pay tribute to the <i>Hansard</i> writers. No one—perhaps not even you, Mr. Malins, or Mr. McWilliam—has had to pay such close attention to what is happening and never miss a word. The stress is considerable. The importance of their role in providing an accurate record of debates is essential to parliamentary life and I pay tribute to them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rendel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to join other hon. Members in thanking all Committee members for participating in our debates and particularly you, Mr. Malins, and Mr. McWilliam, for chairing the Committee so ably. I shall not take as long as the Minister and the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford in making my final comments in the Committee because on one or two occasions some of us have felt that speeches were perhaps marginally longer than they needed to be.<br><br>
I thank the Committee Clerks, who have been a great help. My hon. Friend the Member for Winchester and I have relatively new Members compared to some hon. Members, although I have been in the House for six years. We sometimes need more help from the Committee Clerks than some other Committee members and I am particularly grateful to the Clerks for having given us that help so ably.<br><br>
I thank members of the <i>Hansard</i> staff whom I have annoyed on occasions by failing to give the correct references when I quoted Labour Members. That caused them extra difficulty.<br><br>
I also thank the other members of staff who have attended the Committee and helped us throughout.<br><br>
I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Winchester. It is fair to say that we have proved ourselves a totally united party throughout our proceedings, despite divisions in both other parties. We have been particularly well united on the few sad occasions when my hon. Friend has not been in the Room, but even when we have both been present, we have voted together throughout our proceedings, whether in support of the Government or in support of the Opposition. I am delighted to have such a happy end to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is my first opportunity to say a few words to the Committee. I begin by saying that my co-Chairman, John McWilliam, who associates himself with my comments, has been a tremendous support and guide to me in the first Committee that I have chaired. It has been a thoroughly enjoyable experience because the Committee has been good humoured. Where there is a good humour, there is life. I thank everyone for that.<br><br>
I thank the three Ministers who contributed great charm and ability to our debates during the past eight or nine weeks. I thank them sincerely for their contributions.<br><br>
I thank the Opposition Front-Bench spokesmen for their contributions, which, of necessity, have sometimes had to be lengthy. There was a time when the hon. Member for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I1057">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1073</span>
Grantham and Stamford had a bad back. We were sympathetic, but we were delighted that the affliction did not extend to his voice. He was supported by the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar, whose shirts and braces provided an exciting view from the Chair. I thank them for their important contributions to our proceedings.<br><br>
I also thank the hon. Member for Newbury and his hon. Friend the hon. Member for Winchester for their attendance, contributions and thoughtful words during the Committee.<br><br>
Perhaps most important of all, I thank the Back Benchers. Depending on which side of the Committee they sit, the job of being Back Benchers in a Committee can be difficult. On one side they are sometimes expected to contribute substantially and, as I know to my cost, on the Government side they are expected not to contribute substantially, and sometimes not at all. It has been a particular pleasure for John McWilliam and myself to hear Back Benchers speak in the Committee who were free from constraint and always made thoughtful, interesting and well-received contributions. I thank them all most warmly.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1074</span>
I thank the police and the Doorkeepers for their help and efficiency, as well as the <i>Hansard</i> Committee Sub-Editors and the transcribers for their very fine work.<br><br>
My particular thanks go to our Clerk, Mr. Priestley, who was supported by his colleague, Mr. Fox. It is not possible for a Chairman to get through a Committee without able assistance and the very fact that I have survived is entirely due to the support and help of my Clerk. There was only one slightly disappointing moment. One evening, just before Easter, our Clerk's wife and children found themselves watching him at work. As the Committee knows, the Clerk comes to the fore when there is a vote. Therefore, while his wife and family were watching, it was almost essential that there should be a Division for them to think that he had any job to do. I sat here, mentally urging that there should be a vote. His wife and family were here for one hour—there was no vote. They left wondering whether he had a job of work to do.<br><br>
If I speak for much longer, I shall be accused of a filibuster, so my sincere thanks again to everyone who has taken part in this enjoyable and worthwhile Committee.</span></p>
