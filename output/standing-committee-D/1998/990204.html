	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Michie	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Heeley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Malins. When I received the card to say that I had been selected to sit on the Committee, I went to the Vote Office in the Members' Lobby and found that it had run out of the relevant papers. I have been busy, so I did not go to the Vote Office in the Norman Shaw North building until this morning, which also had run out. I make no criticism of the Clerks, who made some telephone calls and found one copy at No. 1 Whitehall. It was good exercise to go there and I obtained the last copy. If cards, and subsequent reminders, can be sent to us, cannot the relevant papers also be sent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Michie. I shall ensure that that point of order is passed to the relevant people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jack 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fylde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Malins. I too have some difficulty in connection with the papers, but not for the same reasons as the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like your ruling, Mr. Malins, on whether we are adequately equipped with the information to discuss the proposals. I sought comfort from the explanatory memorandum on the impact on business and, indeed, the financial impact of the proposal, but comfort could I find none. After some difficulty, I obtained a copy of the explanatory document issued by the Northern Ireland Office—I assume that that is where it came from, but it does not say so—and eventually discovered that part III refers to the document—Impact on Business—which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A Regulatory Impact Assessment is not considered necessary as the Order will not impact on business."</p></blockquote>
I do not wish to pre-empt our debate, but the order will clearly have a profound effect on all aspects of life in Northern Ireland. It seems cavalier to state that it will not have an impact on business. Is it in order to debate the order in the light of that statement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a matter for me, Mr. Jack, but hon. Members may wish to raise it with the Minister during our debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.32 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Paul Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Departments (Northern Ireland) Order 1999.</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
On 18 December 1998, the First Minister designate for Northern Ireland, the right hon. Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble), and the Deputy First Minister designate, the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh (Mr. Mallon), issued a statement setting out their proposals for the structures of Northern Ireland Departments, north-south implementation bodies and areas of co-operation. The order takes account of the part of the statement that concerns the Departments. It provides the legislative base for an Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister and a total of 10 other Departments in accordance with those proposals. They are the direct result of implementing the Good Friday agreement and of detailed negotiations between the First Minister and Deputy First Minister in Belfast in the run-up to Christmas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Member for South Down (Mr. McGrady) was incorrectly described in the list of Members as the Member for South Devon. Those are equally pleasant constituences, but I know which one the hon. Gentleman want to represent. He was instrumental during an evening of intense negotiations, which went on until 4 o'clock in the morning, between and on behalf of the new Administration designate in Northern Ireland and the Government of the Republic of Ireland, on the north south implementation bodies and, of course, the Departments, which are the sole responsibility of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister. They enshrined the agreement in legislation, and negotiated the agreement after Good Friday. Therefore, as such, the proposals are not Government proposals. The order is simply our method of framing in law what was agreed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will recall that the Good Friday agreement—for which people voted—stated that there should be up to 10 Departments in the new Northern Ireland Administration. After many weeks of deliberation, the conclusion was reached that there should indeed be 10 Departments. At the moment, there are six Departments: the Department of Education, the Department of the Environment, the Department of Finance and Personnel, for which I am responsible, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Economic Development and the Department of Health and Social Services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed departmental structure will retain three existing Departments: the Departments of Education, of the Environment and of Finance and Personnel. Three other existing Departments will be renamed. The Department of Agriculture will become the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development; the Department of Health and Social Services will become the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety; and the Department of Economic Development will become the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment. Five new Departments will be created: the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure; the Department of Higher and Further Education, Training and Employment; the Department for Regional Development; and the Department for Social Development. In addition, the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister will be created.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0164">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
The order does not specify the functions of those Departments. A further order on the transfer of functions, which is to be enacted through subordinate legislation, is currently being prepared. That order will redistribute the functions of the current six Departments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Londonderry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When can we expect that order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will simply provide for the creation and renaming of the Northern Ireland Departments; it will not establish their functions. The order will be enacted as soon as possible. If the hon. Gentleman wants me to provide details of the Department's functions, I am perfectly happy to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The negotiations that took place on 18 December, and which led to the creation of the Departments, examined their functions in considerable detail. We do not have that information at the moment, because the Stormont negotiations on the distribution of functions concluded only in the last few days.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Belfast, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister satisfied that those negotiations have dealt with all the functions of the Northern Ireland Government? I understand that, during the preliminary discussions, some 15 areas of responsibility were overlooked. Must we wait for those areas to be defined at a later date?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. There are areas—not necessarily controversial areas—that were for various reasons omitted from the preliminary negotiations. I am given to understand that the discussions have now finished, and that all the Northern Ireland Government's functions have been dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to providing a new departmental structure, the order will consolidate the Ministries of Northern Ireland Act (Northern Ireland) 1921, which deals with the administration of public services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are four key elements in the consolidated provisions. First, the order will re-enact the requirement that each Department is subject to the direction and control of its Minister. It will also maintain the authority of a departmental Minister to distribute his or her Department's functions among its officers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the order will transfer powers currently enshrined in the Ministries Act (Northern Ireland) Act 1944, which enable the assignment and transfer of functions between Departments. Those powers will be conferred on the First Minister and Deputy First Minister acting jointly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, it will enable junior Ministers to exercise functions to the extent authorised by determination of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, which was enacted in section 19 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, other existing provisions that would be re-enacted by the order will include giving Departments the status of corporate bodies, provision for the use of official seals by Departments, and for documents to be accepted as evidence of acts of Departments. Normal procedures for an Order in Council include a public
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
consultation period, but this draft order was not published. However, the changes to departmental structures contained in it are very different from normal in that, after 18 December, the world knew precisely what the departments were, and there was a tremendous amount of negotiation in Stormont and discussion in the public arena after 18 December. Furthermore, the order was circulated to, and considered by, the First Minister, Deputy First Minister and the Northern Ireland Assembly party leaders. In addition, the proposed changes to the organisation and structure of Northern Ireland Departments was discussed and agreed by the Northern Ireland shadow Assembly on 18 January 1999. A final report and determination by the First Minister and Deputy First Minister is to be brought to the Assembly on 15 February 1999.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude by summarising the key provisions of the order. It establishes an office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister. It provides for 10 other Northern Ireland Departments. It requires departmental functions to be subject to the direction and control of the departmental Minister, and it enables functions to be assigned to, or transferred between, Departments by order made by the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister acting jointly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order is much more important because, in effect, it will put into operation, when devolution takes place—as we hope it will, relatively soon—an entirely new Administration in Northern Ireland based on agreement between the parties about precisely what type of Administration they require. That is why I hope that the Committee will endorse the new Departments for Northern Ireland, bearing in mind that they were approved by the Assembly in January this year and, I hope, will be finally determined later in February.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.42 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Moss	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Cambridgeshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister rightly pointed out, our duty today is to agree that which has already been decided by the parties to the Belfast agreement and, in his words, to put into law what they agreed—"they" being the parties who signed that agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I was reading the order, several questions relating to the Departments occurred to me, which I shall raise in a moment. The order could have been written slightly differently to make it more intelligible to the average person. It is only following an explanation from the Minister and with prior knowledge of how Departments are organised in Northern Ireland that one arrives at the figure of 10 because, on first reading, the order appears to omit three of the Departments mentioned by the Minister that will remain, although not in their original form: the Department of the Environment, the Department of Finance and Personnel and the Department of Education—which, I presume, will retain a function only in relation to schools, all its other functions being removed from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0165">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
The Minister went on to talk about the order that is to follow; the transfer of functions order. The hon. Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Ross) asked the Minister a direct question about how soon we could expect that order, but he did not receive a direct answer. I think that "as soon as possible" was as much as the Minister could say. The Committee should have been able to scrutinise both orders in tandem. We are being asked today to rubber stamp the order that sets up the Departments, but we still do not know what functions some of those Departments will perform. The Committee should have been asked to consider both those issues together. I recognise the Minister's difficulties. The decision on the Department's was probably made some weeks or months ago. He used the excuse that the parties to the agreement have only just decided which functions the Departments are to perform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is like putting the cart before the horse. How can it be decided that Northern Ireland needs a Department for Regional Development if that Department's specific functions have not been determined? I wonder what the Department for Social Development will embrace. Nothing that has been supplied to the Committee has made that clear. I realise that it is too late to make changes, but both orders should have been considered together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister rightly said that the order arises from the Belfast agreement. We are aware of the intense negotiations that took place and the compromises that were reached out of necessity on what began as a blank sheet of paper. The Minister admitted that the arrangements did not follow the Government's plan of action, whatever that may have been. Given the pre-negotiating positions of the parties to the agreement, we concur that the Government were right to allow them to determine the format of the devolved Assembly in which they will sit and of the Ministries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arrangements are, however, a dog's dinner. I wonder where some functions will find a home. I do not wish to be overcritical, but the arrangements evolved to ensure that each participating party received at least two Ministries each. Those who were party to the negotiations may put me right, but from a distance it appears that some Departments were thought up to spread power across all parties and to ensure that there are jobs for the boys.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment, one Minister does two substantial departmental jobs covering health and social security and education—the two biggest and most demanding Departments. That will probably be broken up into three or four Departments, so three or four Ministers will do what one Minister does now. Will there be sufficient work in some Departments to maintain a full ministerial team and a back-up of civil servants?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My questions about later articles concern officers who will serve in the Departments. Who will determine the staffing level and civil service support for Departments, some of which will be small and will not have much to do? Who will be responsible for
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
budgeting civil service support? Will the current civil service be redeployed among the new Departments, or will there be economies in staffing levels?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister offered to explain where functions will go, will he say where transport and planning will end up? I would have thought that planning would go to the Department for Regional Development. An article in a Belfast paper said that in the early stages planning was overlooked. How could that happen?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the question of the division of responsibilities, the hon. Gentleman mentioned education, for which a large Department is responsible. Is he aware that there is great concern about the division of that Department? One of its most important responsibilities, primary education, might be starved of finance because it has been separated from higher and further education, training and employment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes an extremely good point. I do not know the answer to his question, but I am sure that the Minister heard it, and that he may shed some light on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen to the non-departmental public bodies? The previous Government set up many such bodies—I cannot remember exactly how many, but the total is in the region of eight or nine. They were mainly in the Department of the Environment, which it appears will be split up. Who will be responsible for those NDPBs? Will they be the responsibility of the new Departments—although it is not clear which Department they will be slotted into—or will they remain fairly autonomous and free-standing, and will they retain the powers that they were given by the previous Government? Does the Minister know, from his discussions with parties in the Assembly, of any intention—or do the Government intend—to examine NDPBs, with a view to fundamentally altering their functions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will clarify the meaning of some of the sub-paragraphs in article 4, which deals with the exercise of functions of a department. Aricle 4(2)(b) states that a Minister may, in pursuance of the provisions in article 4(1),
	<br><blockquote><p>"by Minute laid before the Assembly assign any specified functions of the department to such officers of the department as he may determine under such designation as he may determine."</p></blockquote>
Does that introduce the concept of devolving a power to a civil servant or an officer of a Department, in a way that perhaps mirrors the powers that are given under English statute to some planning officers in local authorities? Powers sometimes have to be devolved so that planning officers can take decisions of their own volition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It appears that article 4(2)(b) will allow a Minister to give powers to a civil servant to take such action as he thinks is necessary, or to do certain things, without the Minister necessarily checking that decision before it is implemented. What does the order mean by the assignment of specified functions? Are those powers similar to the powers that Ministers and the civil service enjoy under Westminster Parliamentary legislation, or are they peculiar to Northern Ireland?
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0166">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
Was the idea taken from the earlier Stormont Parliament and replicated in the order? It would be helpful if the Minister could clarify the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the order is agreed to, as it undoubtedly will be, I am sure that all Committee members hope that it will be in place in good time for the day of devolution, whenever that occurs. The Secretary of State's comments today make it obvious that time is getting short. The process involves immense pressure, and movement is needed on several fronts. We hope that progress will be made, that the Assembly will soon be up and running and that the parties' decisions will be implemented in the way that they anticipated. As I said earlier, although they will be starting with a blank sheet of paper, perhaps they would not have chosen to start from the point at which they have started. By the Government's own admission, a different model might have been used to implement the devolutionary process. But that is what the parties have chosen, and once the Assembly is up and running, it is for the parties to make changes as they see fit. My view is that the process is cumbersome, that it will be difficult to apply and that some changes will be made out of necessity. If the agreement is not implemented in full, I hope that some kind of renegotiation will take place. If the two main parties to the agreement decide to proceed with devolution, they will at least have a blueprint. If the Belfast agreement is not implemented in full, however, all the parties will not be present, and a completely different structure may evolve.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eddie McGrady	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Down)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the order as an important step in the progress towards implementation of the Good Friday agreement. It is the distillation of many months of intense negotiations, in various formats, among the representatives of the parties in the Northern Ireland Assembly—there were 10 parties at the last count, but there may be 11 since I left, as there is a tendency to change in certain quarters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised to hear hon. Members say that there is a lack of information about which executive function comes under the headings of particular departmental designations. At least two detailed reports have been published. The first was the agreement itself, which was published on 18 December and received widespread publicity. The second was an updated report, which was published and debated in the Assembly on 18 January. Those who are interested in Northern Ireland have had ample opportunity to find out the minutiae of the disciplines, which are described under the headings. The fifteen points that were not included, although they were supported, were not significant in terms of the totality of the executive functions allocated under each of the headings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am somewhat disappointed at the tendency to think that because there are 10 Departments there are jobs for the boys—I heard that phrase this afternoon, apart from it being a sexist remark, it is an insulting
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
one. The reason why I find it insulting is that people of all parties and all persuasions sat day in and day out for eight months to try to work out the best way to deliver the services that the people of Northern Ireland need. Hon. Members should remember that we have a die-cast departmental designation that has not really changed since 1973; some argue that it has not really changed since the 1920s and 1930s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the parties, irrespective of political philosophy and aspirations, were determined to make use of what has been described as a blank page. We did not want to be circumscribed by the past or dictated to by powers developed by the civil service. We wanted—and were determined to have—an entirely new dynamic in the service of Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the allegation of jobs for the boys or girls, seven parties of very disparate viewpoints—from extreme unionism to extreme republicanism—tabled their interpretations, based on their own examination of the best way to deliver the appropriate services to the people whom they represent. The other three parties did absolutely nothing. They did not issue one piece of paper on departmental designations. The Ulster Democratic Unionist party, which has been highly critical of the whole process, has issued not one jot of paper. It is the same with the United Kingdom Unionist party and the minor party that has since been formed, which I think is called the Independent Unionist party, with its three members. They have issued not one scrap of paper, yet they have been major critics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All but two of the parties that submitted documentation designated 10 Departments. For the record, I have to correct what I said earlier. The DUP did make a submission. It submitted a paper showing eight Departments, plus one at the centre. We must take reality as it is. The nature of the disciplines under each of the headings and how they are balanced between the Departments is clearly illustrated in the two reports of 18 December and 18 January that I mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 18 January, the Assembly discussed the report for a few days and noted it with approval. It did not "determine" the report—as we say in Northern Ireland—but noted it with approval, with 75 votes for and 24 votes against. That is a 75 per cent. majority for the basis of the order that we are discussing today. It was a cross-party and cross-community endorsement from one extreme to the other. That is significant, and it should be noted and acted upon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been criticism of the whole concept of the agreement, but not one constructive alternative has been proposed. That is a negative attitude to take while the rest of us are trying to engage the entire community and its representatives in a new governance for Northern Ireland. I find the process extremely exciting and rewarding. There are political difficulties involved, which I am not in any way dismissing, but I hope that by 15 February the proposal will receive the same endorsement as it did on 18 January, with a 75 per cent. majority. I think that 51 per cent. is required on a cross-community basis—it cannot be a simple majority.

	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
I endorse the order that is before the Committee, and, in due course, we shall discuss the more detailed aspects of its consequences. It is the culmination of many years work by participants who differ on their political outlook and future aspirations. We hope that the new governance will be effective, efficient and germane to the problems that we have in Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.3 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lembit Öpik 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We welcome the order, which is part of the long-overdue process of devolution brought into the realms of possibility by the Good Friday agreement. Other aspects of the agreement are relevant to the establishment of these bodies, such as progress on decommissioning, but they are not directly relevant to the debate today or to the order, so we should not dwell on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In line with the spirit of devolution, the exact nature of the structures and the new Northern Ireland Executive must be a matter for those involved in the Northern Ireland Assembly and local people. I was, therefore, encouraged to hear the Minister say that extensive consultations have taken place, and that the order has tried to enshrine the opinions of those actively involved in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the fact that the Department of Agriculture is being extended, and will become the new Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. As anyone who has been following the fortunes of the countryside knows, rural life is about much more than just agriculture. A farmer suggested to me that the Department should have been called the Department of Agriculture, Rural Development and Flooding, but I shall not put that forward as a serious proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the separation of the Department of Education and the Department of Further Education and Employment, because there are benefits in separating two qualitatively different aspects of education. However, as has been said, there are concerns about funding. What assurance can the Minister give that one part or other of the education system will not be starved through competition between the two Departments?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be grateful for the Minister's response on several points. First, I am concerned about the lack of a Department for equality. That is no doubt a consequence of consultation in Northern Ireland, but many people—especially within the nationalist and republican communities—are concerned that the fine words on equality may not be put into practice. What assurance is there that there will be a junior Minister responsible for equality issues, perhaps working out of the First and deputy First Minister's office?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the order does not make it clear how a tourism strategy is to develop—perhaps I have missed the reference. Tourism seems to come under the remit of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, while visitor amenities are dealt with by the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure. That surely shows a lack of logic, because if tourism is to
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
enjoy an increasing role in the Northern Ireland economy, it deserves to be handled holisticalfy. There is no north-south implementation body for tourism, which is an area in which north-south co-operation might be especially valuable. What does the Minister regard as the right way to ensure a holistic and strategic approach to the important area of tourism?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the order provides for junior Ministers to exercise functions, to the extent authorised by a determination under the Northern Ireland Act 1998, by the First Minister and Deputy First Minister. That gives Ministers quite a lot of responsibility. I am not saying that that is a negative proposal; it is a natural consequence of empowering an Assembly that Ministers will be able to authorise functions without always having to check with somebody else. However, that fact makes it even more important that we do all we can to ensure that the Assembly does not develop a profoundly confrontational etiquette that prevents Ministers from co-operating with each other— otherwise, we will encourage endless criticism of ministerial decisions within parties or on the Floor of the Assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My fourth point relates to article 8, which provides for functions to be assigned or transferred between Departments by joint order of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. That gives those two officers an awful lot of power, although I am sure that we feel confident that the present incumbents of the posts operate sensibly and co-operatively. It is important that both individuals exercise those powers in a way that creates a responsible precedent. It would be damaging if personalities got in the way of the political process in Northern Ireland. We must be aware of the importance of the early days, months and years of the Assembly so that acceptable procedures and behaviours, which will make it easier for the Assembly to function in the long term, can be set down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One concern that I do not have is whether there will be enough for politicians in Northern Ireland to do. I have never known politicians to be short of work, and even less to be unable to justify their existence. Furthermore, given the size of the responsibility—the administration of an entire nation in the United Kingdom—10 Departments is a reasonable number. It is not excessive. I am relaxed that those individuals have enough to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order is helpful because it continues a logical process, in which genuine decision-making responsibility is being assigned to Northern Ireland in a well-thought-out way, which is the essence of devolution. We must plan for success, and the order is a logical and sensible approach in the context of that process and outlook.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.10 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with great interest to what has been said so far, but I am afraid that I do not share all the views that have been expressed. Like all orders, this one will have consequences. In my experience in the House, such consequences have not always been foreseen. People who foresaw dire
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0168">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
consequences of proposals were laughed at, but a few years later, the Government had to deal with the difficulties that had been created.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his opening remarks, the Minister referred to the functions of the new Departments in the transfer of functions order. I hope that when he winds up, he will give us a clear exposition of each Minister's functions, because I take the view that Northern Ireland has far too many Departments. The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss) was a Northern Ireland Minister. Current Northern Ireland Ministers have constituencies in Great Britain, from which they travel backwards and forwards, rarely spending more than a limited number of days each week in Northern Ireland. They seem perfectly capable of handling the functions delegated to them in their offices. Indeed, I am sure that current and previous Ministers would resent the implication that they did not know what was going on, or that they were failing in their duty in their day-to-day work. Nevertheless, there will be 10 Departments—indeed, 11, because one is a dual Ministry—and Ministers will live in Northern Ireland and be available all the time. I cannot see where the work will come from to keep them all occupied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the order will come into operation on a day to be set by the Secretary of State. Is the target date still 10 March? The Minister should be able to tell us the target date. If it is not 10 March, perhaps we could be told what later date is now contemplated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My difficulties begin whenever I contemplate the very real obstacles that still lie in the path of the implementation of the provisions in the order. It is rather premature to ask us to accept the order today. Time and time again, the Secretary of State and the Prime Minister have said that the decommissioning of weapons is a prerequisite—the Secretary of State said it again on 20 January in Northern Ireland questions. Yesterday, during Prime Minister's questions on the Floor of the House, the Prime Minister said that the IRA should be under an obligation. That obligation has not yet been fulfilled. By implementing the order, bringing into operation all the functions and setting up the Departments, we are giving the impression that terrorist organisations will get away with it and will not have to hand over a single gun or round of ammunition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, the letter of comfort sent to my right hon. Friend the Member for Upper Bann, the leader of the party, in April last year indicated that the effect of the decommissioning section of the agreement was that the process of decommissioning should begin straight away. That was in April. As I said, it has not yet begun, so there is a formidable obstacle to be overcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that every member of the Committee has been reading today's edition of 	<i>The Daily Telegraph.</i> It is required reading in the House. Hon. Members should read all the papers to see what the various organs of the press are saying. Some most interesting reports can be read today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One report raises the old question of the murder of the Garda officer in the Irish Republic, Mr. McCabe. He was murdered by a man who was let out early but is now back in custody. Another reports on the stolen
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
IRA weapons and their use. Another tells us of the Ulster Volunteer Force demonstration that took place in the hills of Northern Ireland only a couple of days ago. We are told that the Continuity IRA has made launchers and heaven knows what.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The picture we are getting is not of people giving up weapons. Far from giving them up, those terrorist organisations are intent on stepping up the violence as soon as they consider it to be convenient. That must have an effect on the order. It is a waste of time to accept the order this afternoon when these formidable obstacles to its implementation remain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will recall the statement made by the former leader of the Unionist party, Lord Molyneaux, in September, when he said
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am concerned by the existence of an unknown body to which almost 70 per cent. of the Provisional IRA's mechanisms and munitions have been quietly transferred since 24th July … Despite all the efforts of the intelligence services … the structure of the new body has not been penetrated or identified".—	<i>[Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 3 September 1998; Vol. 593, c. 26–27.]</p></blockquote>
When we read in the press what has happened, I fear that what my noble Friend said has too much truth in it for comfort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That said, we are now being asked to say that we have considered the order. We are asking the House to accept that we believe that everything is ship-shape, that everything is about to take off, that the ship of state of Northern Ireland will said serenely off into the sunset, and that everyone will be happy ever after. I have some difficulty with that, because at Question Time on 20 January, in answer to the leader of the Opposition about whether we should go on with the agreement, the Prime Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The right hon. Gentleman is, in effect, asking us to bring the whole Good Friday agreement to an end."—	<i>[Official Report,</i> 20 January 1999; Vol. 323, c.902.]</p></blockquote>
I fear that by offering us those words, the Prime Minister was admitting that the blackmail of the threat of violence, through the use of those weapons, was having an effect, and that we were actually dancing to the tune of the terrorist organisations. We should be very careful indeed before giving comfort to terrorist organisations, which is what I fear we are doing this afternoon by passing the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be of interest to the Committee to know what the term "decommissioning" means. Decommissioning is the word on everyone's lips, but I believe that rather more is at stake, because without the surrender of those weapons the order cannot be implemented. That is the policy of the Ulster Unionist party. In its manifesto for the Assembly elections— some of us still take manifestos seriously enough to defend them and stand by them—the Ulster Unionist party said that there must be:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a clear and unequivocal commitment that ceasefires are complete and permanent, that the war is over, and violence ended".</p></blockquote>
Quite obviously, it is not. There was a most atrocious murder at the weekend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The manifesto also required that
	<br><blockquote><p>"targeting, training, weapons procurement and so-called punishment beatings cease forthwith … That there is progressive abandonment and dismantling of paramilitary structure … That use of 'proxy' organisations for paramilitary purposes cannot be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0169">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
tolerated… That disarmament will be completed in two years… That the fate of the disappeared would be made known immediately."</p></blockquote>
None of that has happened. We are discussing the order prematurely, because formidable obstacles remain. We must deal with weapons and with the destruction of the infrastructure of terrorist organisations. Unless we understand that to the Unionist people and the Unionist party decommissioning is shorthand for what I have just described, we will never comprehend the matter clearly. That is a necessary step on the road to the creation of the Executive. The document must pass through the House and become part of the law, yet the obstacles remain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recently, the Chief Constable said that, despite the fact that the IRA and other terrorist organisations were supposed to be involved in the cessation of violence—including those organisations that purport to be involved in the cessation of military operations— they are still engaged in terrorist beatings. That leads me to ask exactly what the term "cessation of military operations" means to the IRA and other organisations. They look upon mutilations, shootings, beatings, the murder that happend last weekend and the threatened murder of others as police action within their community. Not enough people here or in the House understand that that is their means of imposing their will on the population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If hon. Members have the good fortune to hear a tape of the "Talkback" phone-in programme on Radio Ulster a week last Monday, they would have a clear understanding of how people look on the activities of terrorist organisations, how deeply they are involved in them and the reason why an attempt was made to overthrow, undermine and destroy the present police force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no doubt that the order will be approved today. I fear that the Assembly will accept it in a week or so. However, I hope that it has the good sense to refuse to do so until it sees the colour of the IRA's money in the form of a large number of weapons, and Semtex, being handed over, and receives evidence that paramilitary structures have been dismantled. Some hon. Members may allow themselves to be misled. It is somewhat of an effort to get Sinn Fein and the IRA into the Executive: they are inextricably linked. It will be impossible ever to disentangle them: the two bodies are one and the same—the party is under the control of the IRA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be an attempt to fudge the issue. If Sinn Fein is allowed into the Executive and the necessary proposals are passed by the Assembly, there will be a declaration, the context of which will be changed behind closed doors. It may be said that, when the IRA sees members of Sinn Fein sitting in the Executive, it will be a different world and it might be persuaded to hand over its weapons. Anyone who believes that will believe that the sun rises in the west and sinks in the east. Of course they will not. It goes to the fundamentals of all those organisations, principally the IRA, and it will not happen. They may decide to
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
hand over a few weapons—I doubt it, but it is possible that the Loyalist Volunteer Force will find a few weapons, one of them a fine collector's item.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then we will have St. Patrick's day. There may be a Scot or two in the Committee who will understand this, but as a member of clan Ross I look to another patron saint rather than Patrick; others may, nevertheless, admire him—after all, he was a Briton. We are informed that some people are invited across to Washington for the St. Patrick's day celebrations on 17 March. What wine will flow, what pressures will be exerted, what promises will be exacted, what arms will be screwed up backs to ensure that, even if it has not taken place by then, shortly thereafter the Executive will be set up. Then we will come back to the Unionist party manifesto, and if it is not met, we are assured by the leader of the Unionist party that he will not appoint. What we are doing today may look good in the eyes of some hon. Members, but how it will work in practice is a different matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are setting up here used to be called power sharing; some would say that "coalition" is the acceptable term. Coalitions are enforced marriages of necessity. When a coalition is created, even when attempts are made to get people on to Cabinet committees or to talk about proportional representation at elections, all at once we find that, sadly, these things do not necessarily work out if the governing party has a majority. I take the view that this power-sharing system cannot work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us look at what is proposed. First, there will be 11 Departments. The first is the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, those Siamese twins who march in step, who wave in unison. They cannot do otherwise. If one falls or dies or retires, the other has to go and two more must be elected. They cannot move without one another. Where it is impossible for the will of the majority to carry, the will of the minority is the deciding factor. Anyone who thinks seriously about whether politics works knows that that is the inevitable consequence of a power-sharing arrangement, because the minority will always demand and demand and demand. Then they will say, "If we don't get it, we walk out of the whole thing".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is my fundamental, philosophical and practical objection to this system. I have held that view since I studied it closely some 30 years ago. I have never seen any good reason to change my mind. It was for long the Unionist party's view that the system was not working. The leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party is on record as saying that power sharing is an unworkable concept. I agree with him. It is one of a few things that I agree with him about. I therefore believe that the whole thing is doomed in the long run, unless the majority always give way to the demands of the minority on every issue—if not now, when they come back to the issue in three months' time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then there is the cost of the Departments for the 10 over worked Northern Ireland Ministers. The idea of 10 Ministers for 1.5 million people is nonsense. The system was created simply because the SDLP, on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0170">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
examining how the d'Hondt system would work, found that it was sure of getting the 10th seat, which brought its total up to three.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the reality. We do not need that many Ministers. I think that six or seven would be more than sufficient. Jobs are being created for parties to ensure a 50:50 division between unionism and nationalism— republicanism—in the capital of Northern Ireland. The situation is crazy; the order is crazy. I believe that we will soon be back here saying, "Very sorry. The whole thing didn't work. It has all ended in tears and misery. We have to start again." We need to make sensible and workable arrangements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am somewhat puzzled. First, I understood— perhaps naively—that the hon. Gentleman represents the Ulster Unionist party, but he seems to contradict its policies. Its leadership, its Assembly party and its Six Counties council endorsed the agreement entirely. Secondly, the earlier thrust of his argument implied that we should halt the democratic process because of the activities of paramilitaries.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only are the structures wrong, but the basic philosophy is wrong. We are creating a structure that will cause much misery.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I felt pre-chastised by the hon. Member for South Down (Mr. McGrady) for having the temerity to speak. He seemed to suggest that unless Committee members have read the two detailed documents and the debate in the Assembly, they should not enter into what at times appeared to be a closed discussion. I hope that he will forgive me if I trespass. I may be ignorant about this matter, but I am genuinely interested to understand how the new mechanism will operate. Members of the House of Commons are being invited to agree to the order, and we do that against the background of how we have got to this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
I was disappointed with part III of the explanatory document. We are being asked to agree to a new governmental structure for Northern Ireland and it is important to have an idea of its impact. Part III says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A Regulatory Impact Assessment is not considered necessary as the Order will not impact on business."</p></blockquote>
I am sure that a feature of the new arrangements will be consultation with business on the activities that the Ministries and Ministers are going to undertake. But there is nothing in the explanatory document to say whether that is a feature of the new arrangements and, if it is, how it is supposed to work. Consultation will be an important part of the way forward and of the effort to encourage all parties to reach a consensus on difficult and sensitive issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The documents should have contained, for the Committee's benefit, an estimate of the costs that will be involved. Other Committee members said that a contrast between the cost of the current Government Departments in Northern Ireland and of the new arrangements would have been helpful. It would have helped the Committee—whose approval of the order is being sought—to form an idea of the financial commitment. We should be given an estimate of the wider implications of what we are being asked to agree to—if that is our desire—before we say either aye or no to an order. Not giving us an estimate rather takes us for granted. The phrase "we have not had time to debate" really upset me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire made some important points on the transfer of functions order, to which the Minister referred. It would have been advantageous if the orders had been taken together. Those of us who have not had the pleasure of following these matters in detail could have seen the relationship between the two orders. When I first read the order I, too, had certain questions about the relationship between the proposed new Departments and the existing arrangements. However, I shall restrict my questions to the Minister because those matters will be the subject of further consideration. When the Minister presents the transfer of functions order to the House I hope that its explanatory memorandum will tell us, for example, about the relationship between the economic policy unit, which I believe will be part of the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, and those parts of the Ministries that have economic responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two interesting features of what will undoubtedly be a close-knit legislative process are how interaction will take place and how cross-over issues will be settled. For example, the role of the Department for Regional Development will have an impact on the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, but neither the order nor the explanatory memorandum tells us how those Departments will interact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to probe the Minister on a matter that is related to the Northern Ireland agreement. On the functions of the Departments and the execution of their powers, neither the order nor the related documentation gives details of the procedures under
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0171">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
which Ministers will operate, and I have no idea what they might be. Will the Assembly adapt or adopt those procedures that govern Ministers in other parts of the United Kingdom, or will new procedures be invented? If so, how will they be promulgated? Clearly, fair dealing will be a crucial feature if the consensus that will be the new way of governing Northern Ireland is to be realised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 4 confers significant powers and responsibilities on Ministers and their deputies. I respect much of what has been said, especially by the hon. Member for South Down, who pointed out how much time, energy and effort had been spent getting the agreements that gave rise to the order. Article 4(1) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The functions of a department shall at all times be exercised subject to the direction and control of the Minister."</p></blockquote>
That appears to give a Minister, for the first time, a virtual hire-and-fire capability over every aspect of his or her Department's operation. Will Ministers be able to hire and fire anyone in their Departments, or will that power be given to someone else?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sub-paragraph (a) of article (4)(2) states that a Minister will have the power to
	<br><blockquote><p>"distribute the business of a department among the officers of the department in such manner as he thinks fit".</p></blockquote>
That will be an onerous responsibility. Given religious sensitivities and other factors particular in Northern Ireland, what checks and balances will exist to ensure the effective, balanced distribution of those powers? We must ensure that nobody can cast doubt on the way in which responsibilities are distributed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those whom I call the bean counters will seek personal information on civil servants working in the Departments, and they may cast aspersions on, for example, their beliefs. How will that be resolved, given the considerable powers that will be granted to Ministers? Where will the responsibility lie?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I gather that, in the past, there have been problems with some of the departmental seals to which article 7 refers. Will the Minister say—either now or through correspondence—whether the new proposals are proof against the problems encountered in Cunningham v. Winton and Ministry of Home Affairs, which was heard in 1960? That case cast some doubt on the validity of the process of sealing documents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The powers that will be given to Northern Ireland Ministers are extensive. I hope that the Minister can satisfy us on the way in which the procedures will operate. Will the House of Commons retain the power to enact further orders to reverse or change the provisions before us, if it so wishes?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although Northern Ireland will govern itself, the House of Commons will ultimately remain interested in the government of Northern Ireland. Will the Northern Ireland Office review and measure the new procedures' effectiveness, and discuss the government of Northern Ireland with the new Ministers, their Departments and, indeed, the Assembly? Alternatively, will the House of Commons lose for all time the ability to amend or change the arrangements that we are asked to accept today?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
It is important and proper that those of us who participate in the democratic process maintain an interest in those matters. I would like to explore some factors that are perhaps deeply sensitive, but which may prove necessary if, for example, the order should lead to an abuse of power. I should be grateful if the Minister would comment on that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is aware that no hon. Member would relinquish the right to raise in the House—or anywhere else—any matter brought to him by a constituent. A measure of friction may develop between this place and Scotland and Wales, as well as Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, the hon. Gentleman makes an important point from a position of information in Northern Ireland. I make the point to ensure that the House maintains its right to legislate on the way in which the different parts of the kingdom are governed. One interesting question, which goes slightly beyond the boundaries of our debate, concerns the way in which the powers of the First Minister, the Deputy First Minister and the new Departments are conferred and the way in whch the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly will operate. There are some important points of interaction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 4(3) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to the provisions of this Order, any functions of a department may be exercised"</p></blockquote>
not only by a Minister, but by
	<br><blockquote><p>"a senior officer of the department."</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister clarify that the line of accountability for any action taken by a senior officer remains via the Minister in charge of the Department to the Assembly? The point of accountability for action is very important and I seek comfort on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting debate, during which many issues were raised: perhaps the most important was that St. Patrick was a Welshman. The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire referred to the transfer of functions order. I want to make it absolutely clear that the order is subordinate legislation. It will not be debated in the House of Commons, but will be available for information to Members of the House. The details that it will cover— the precise and final number of functions to be carried out by the various Departments—will be put to the Assembly on 15 February, after which, out of courtesy to the Assembly, I shall ensure that any hon. Member who wants to know the details of the finalised list of functions can obtain them. I can provide hon. Members today with those details that are available if they so request.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was not an excuse to say that the final details are not before us, nor that the two orders run in parallel. The reason is simple—the final negotiations on those functions have not been concluded. Some hon. Members asked how the list of Departments could be finalised without finalising the functions. Most of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0172">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
functions were finalised before Christmas, but there were so many to deal with that there had to be some changes later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government do not have a political view on the rights and wrongs of where those functions should be. We are legislating on an agreement in which the Government did not take part; we were present as observers. Under the Belfast agreement, the Government were available to be consulted, for technical, administrative and financial reasons, and to give advice to the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister when they were negotiating with the parties and on the north-south bodies with the Irish Government. I sat in a number of those meetings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the Committee that a enormous amount of hard work went into the negotiations. We were not discussing jobs for the boys. The Belfast agreement last year allowed up to 10 Departments, and that was agreed in detail. Of course, there is an element of ensuring that ministerial jobs are spread across the main political spectrum of the parties that have won the largest number of seats in the Assembly. That is the essence of the Executive. The d'Hondt procedure is such that if a party wins sufficient seats, it will automatically be entitled to positions on the Executive. It is a well-known fact, for example, that three of the 10 ministerial positions will go to members of the Ulster Unionist party, three to the SDLP, two to the Democratic Unionist party and two to Sinn Fein.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not the time or place to comment on the politics that lie behind the formation of that Executive in some weeks' time or whenever it will be, because that is a wider matter for wider debate. I simply say that the essence of the Executive, as set out in the agreement, for which the majority of people in Northern Ireland voted, is such that we must take into account its cross-community nature. The four parties that I have mentioned and others all put up reasoned and sensible cases for these Departments to carry out those functions. The Departments were not arrived at willy-nilly or in a few minutes, but took a great deal of negotiation and hard bargaining.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other problem is the separation of functions. It is not for me to try to explain why certain functions will be carried out by British Ministers rather than by Ministers in Northern Ireland. The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire mentioned two functions: transport and planning. Planning control comes under the new Department of the Environment, whereas strategic planning comes under the Department for Regional Development. I believe that that is a sensible division, and it is what was decided. Similarly, the Department for Regional Development will deal with transport planning, public transport such as buses, the transport holding company, road services, and rail, port and airport services—everything that comes under the general heading of transport. It is for the parent Department and the new Ministers to decide what the relationship of the NDPBs will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals for officials' functions contain nothing new. The civil service will work under the direction and control of the departmental Ministers— I shall return in more detail to the point raised by the
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack). Article 4 accepts the current law in Northern Ireland in that respect, and there are no new powers: there has been consolidation for many years and there is no difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for South Down said that there has been ample opportunity to explore these issues since 18 December, when the Departments were decided upon. It has been a matter of huge debate in Northern Ireland, as hon. Members who represent Northern Ireland constituencies will testify. I repeat, because it is worth repeating, that the parties and members of the Assembly, some of whom are here, spent a great deal of time and effort on reaching the final decisions on the Departments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. Öpik) said that the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development was properly named. That was a sensible decision by the First Minister and Deputy First Minister. The hon. Gentleman also referred to the Department of equality. That was a matter of debate. There was a divison among the parties as to whether there should be a Department of equality. Indeed, there were good and solid reasons for and against it. The reason why these matters will come under the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister is again to emphasise the importance of the equality agenda under the agreement, and also because the First Minister and Deputy First Minister represent the community across Northern Ireland. They will make the decision about the junior Minister, and I have no doubt that they will consider the matter seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire also referred to tourism. That comes essentially, as he knows, under the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, although I take his point about the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A north-south body for tourism did not materialise at the end of the negotiations, but there will be a public company that will bring together tourist interests north and south, because everybody realises that there is a great deal of sense in close co-operation on tourism across the island of Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for East Londonderry raised a number of important points. His contribution ranged beyond the immediate matter before us, but the essence of much of what he said was to ask why we were passing the legislation if the whole thing is not going to happen. I am not sure whether I should comment on that aspect, but the Assembly has considered these matters, and I hope that they will reach a decision on 15 February. The vast majority of people in Northern Ireland want the agreement to work. Serious problems lie ahead—we are not complacent about that—and I am convinced that those in the assembly who want the agreement to work will redouble their efforts to ensure that it does not fail. Far too much is at stake for that to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The legislation for the Departments is a necessary preparation for devolution in Northern Ireland. Although the hon. Member for East Londonderry referred to direct rule Ministers—he is right in terms of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0173">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
the numbers in the new Northern Ireland Administration—that does not apply only to Belfast, but to Cardiff and Edinburgh if they have devolution; it is for them to decide. The cast of Northern Ireland is different because there is an agreement from which to work, but devolution means that the devolved body must take decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of the cost of the new Departments to which the hon. Member for East Londonderry referred will be a matter for the new Administration. They will have to ensure that they can absorb the cost, and will have to decide their own priorities. Certainly, no new ministerial arrangement in the Executive will work unless it is cross-community—such special circumstances are not shared in Wales and Scotland. I have no doubt that the Assembly Members will consider the cost and the financial arrangements as well as the broader political issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If today's proceedings are to have any merit, it is important that we debate the issue of the cost of the Assembly and the 10 Departments. As was mentioned earlier, the population of Northern Ireland is 1·5 million, which is equivalent to that of Cambridgeshire, Norfolk and Suffolk. Some of the devolved powers would raise a slightly different issue—that relating to the health service, for example—but we need to ask whether the cost of this model of administering Northern Ireland would be much more expensive than the total cost of administering similar Departments for those three counties? If the cost is higher, the Minister cannot simply say that the devolved Parliament must find the money. Who is negotiating the Northern Ireland block? Why should the United Kingdom pay more pro rata—and per head of population—for one part of the United Kingdom than for the United Kingdom as a whole? If the message to the devolved Parliament is that it must find the extra money from within its resources, it will have to rob money from front-line services to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's point about administration and front-line services, and I am sure that all members of the Committee would agree with him. But he knows, as a former Northern Ireland Minister, that comparing three counties in East Anglia with Northern Ireland is like comparing separate planets; it is a question of what we are trying to achieve. We spend £1 billion a year on security—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not in the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's point, but the achievement of a political settlement and peace in Northern Ireland—and the setting up of new Departments—will, of course, cost a significant amount. We would not have to spend £1 billion if there were peace and a political settlement. Everyone knows that if a major bomb goes off in a town or village in Northern Ireland, millions of pounds must be spent—and rightly so—in a variety of
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
ways. That is the purpose of setting up an Executive, 10 Ministers and all the accompanying structures—to achieve a stable and lasting political settlement. We do not know whether that will happen, but this is the best chance that we have ever had. Consequently, we must endorse the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for East Londonderry referred to the significance of the date. The significance is that it is the date when the Privy Council meets to endorse and take account of the legislation on north-south implementation bodies, as well as other legislation. It is not the date set for devolution. In fact, there has been some misconception about that lately in the media. It is the date by which all the necessary legislative preparations must be made to enable devolution to occur thereafter—hopefully, soon thereafter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack) raised several interesting points, the first of which was one that he also raised in a point of order: the question of the relationship between the Assembly and business. The agreement refers to the civic forum, which should take account of representations from business, trade unions, churches, the voluntary sector and others. It will be in a position to help and advise members of the Assembly. When the House of Lords touched on this subject, during consideration of the Northern Ireland Bill in 1998, my noble Friend Lord Dubs warmly endorsed the desirability of the Assembly paying close regard to the implications for business of any proposed legislation. He said that it would be a matter for the Assembly and Northern Ireland Ministers as to how account is taken of such matters. Of course it must be up to the Assembly, but I am convinced that, of those Members of the Assembly who are likely to be Ministers, none would fail to take account of the impact of their decisions on businesses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned in passing the other body—whatever we are to call it— that will be set up. That is not covered by the order, but can he advise the Committee how those people will be elected or appointed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can advise the hon. Gentleman when that information will be available. It will be 15 February, when the right hon. Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble) and the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh (Mr. Mallon) present the report to the Assembly, which will include such details.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On procedures for Ministers, the agreement and schedule 4 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 provides for a pledge of office and a ministerial code of conduct. On relations with civil servants, there will be no difference from the present set-up. In relation to the appointment and procedures by which civil servants are employed in Northern Ireland, special legislation exists to take account of the points that the right hon.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0174">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
Member for Fylde raised. I shall, of course, write to the hon. Gentleman on the matter of seals and the particular case to which he referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman concluded by referring to what will happen about relations between the new body and Westminster and Whitehall. There is provision for a joint ministerial committee—as is the case for Scotland and Wales—to be set up in the United Kingdom. Concordats will be developed on various issues. There will still be a Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and a Northern Ireland Office, which will be responsible for liaison, and, as the hon. Gentleman said, the block grant will have to be negotiated. Finally, this Parliament. will remain sovereign, which, as everyone knows, is the most important factor in showing that Members of the House of Commons will continue to play their part in Northern Ireland matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the details—the hon. Member for East Londonderry touched on this—at the moment, the Lord President is considering procedures by which
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
devolution will occur, and by which we shall relate to the devolved Administration, including questions in the House, both written and oral, Select Committees and Standing Committees, all of which must be considered during the next few months. As the hon. Gentleman will remember, that is not unusual, because when Stormant was up and running, it was necessary to develop procedures by which a Northern Ireland Member could deal with issues considered in Belfast. I am sure that we shall arrive at a sensible arrangement, so that all those who represent Northern Ireland, be it in the Assembly or in the House of Commons, may do what they must do; represent the people to the best of their ability.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
