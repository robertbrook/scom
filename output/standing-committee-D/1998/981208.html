	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Department (Mr. Paul Boateng)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><q><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Police Act 1997 (Notification of Authorisations Etc.) Order 1998.</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the draft Police Act 1997 (Authorisation of Action in Respect of Property) (Code of Practice) Order 1998.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to express our delight, Mrs. Roe, that we are again convened under your chairmanship to discuss an important matter concerning policing. I know of your interest in and experience of the matter, which we shared when members of the Greater London Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government attach high priority to tackling serious and organised crime. It is important to ensure that the police and other law enforcement agencies have the necessary tools to be able to act effectively against modern and sophisticated top criminals. One important tool is the ability to carry out intrusive surveillance when other, more normal policing methods have failed. Intrusion into someone's privacy is not a matter that we take lightly, but it is sometimes necessary. We were pleased to be able to help to shape part III of the Police Act 1977 during its passage through Parliament. Our efforts and the detailed consideration by both sides of the House have provided an essential tool for policing, balanced against realistic and practical safeguards to protect the public from unnecessary invasion of privacy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part III of the 1977 Act puts the use of intrusive surveillance by police, the National Crime Squad, the National Criminal Intelligence Service and Customs and Excise on a proper statutory footing. The decision to authorise surveillance operations rightly remains a matter for operational officers who will be chief officers of police, the director-generals of the National Crime Squad and the National Criminal Intelligence Service and designated senior Customs officers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Note was taken of the concerns expressed during the Bill's passage through the House about the lack of independent oversight of the provisions. Although we did not consider it appropriate to introduce judicial authorisation of such operations, we have ensured that there will be quasi-judicial oversight by independent commissioners who are serving or former High Court judges and who will bring to their task the eminence and independence associated with their office. In July the Prime Minister appointed Sir Andrew Leggatt as
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
Chief Surveillance Commissioner, and he appointed six surveillance commissioners who will be responsible for scrutinising all notifications and authorisations and for giving prior approval, except in urgent cases, to authorisations involving more sensitive categories of surveillance. They will have the power to quash or cancel authorisations which have been improperly given, to order the destruction of records, other than those required for pending civil or criminal proceedings, and to require payment of compensation. They will also be responsible for investigating complaints.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two draft orders are among the final steps before implementation of the provisions. One order relates to the code of practice that will underpin those provisions and to which those exercising functions under part III are required to have regard. The other relates to information that must be provided to commissioners on notification of an authorisation, its renewal or cancellation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The code of practice has already been subject to much consultation and debate. The draft code was first introduced into Parliament during the passage of the 1997 Act. Section 101 of the Act required that a public consultation exercise be carried out on the draft code, which was done in 1997. Copies of the draft code were sent to a wide range of organisations, including legal, judicial, medical and clerical bodies, and to counselling services and civil liberty organisations. Initially, more than 500 copies were sent out to individuals and organisations, and 120 additional copies were dispatched in response to subsequent requests. We received more than 60 responses by the end of the consultation process. I am grateful to hon. Members, including the right hon. Member for Berwick-on-Tweed (Mr. Beith), who submitted detailed responses to the consultation, which were enormously helpful to us. We considered them carefully, and I hope that we have met some of the right hon. Gentleman's concerns—although not, I fancy, all of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have taken into account, so far as the legislation allows, the concerns that were raised. As a result, several changes were made to the draft code before it was laid before Parliament on 18 November. In particular, it has been revised to emphasise the importance of ensuring that the degree of intrusion into the privacy of those affected by surveillance is commensurate with the seriousness of the offence. It also makes specific reference to the special consideration that should be given to collateral intrusion—that is, incidental intrusion on those who are not the direct target of the surveillance—and to interference in circumstances involving the seal of confession or spiritual counselling. Following on from concerns that were raised during the passage of the Bill, it also gives guidance on when the urgency provisions can be used, making it clear that they must be used not routinely but only in exceptional circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other draft order gives details of the information that must be provided to a commissioner with a notification of authorisation, renewal or
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0015">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
cancellation of an authorisation. Here again, we have taken into account some of the comments that we received during the consultation process, and the draft order provides for a great many of the details that we have been asked to include.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When a notification of an authorisation is given by an authorising officer—that is, a chief constable or equivalent—to a commissioner, it must record whether it is a case for which the prior approval of a commissioner is required, and, if it is a case which would otherwise require the approval of a commissioner but in which intrusive surveillance has started because of urgency, the grounds on which the case is believed to be urgent. One cannot simply start surveillance by claiming urgency without subsequently being subject to the requirement to notify the commissioner of the reason one considered it to be urgent. That reason can be taken into account by the commissioner in his or her deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When a notification of authorisation is given, it must also record how the authorisation criteria have been met—for example, how the case fits within the definition of serious crime and why the purpose which the action seeks to achieve cannot reasonably be achieved by other means. Other matters include the identity or identities, where known, of those to be targeted; the property against which any intrusive surveillance is to take place; the nature of the surveillance authorised and the reason why the intrusive surveillance in question is necessary; whether the intrusive surveillance is considered likely to lead to collateral intrusion on or interference with persons other than the person being targeted by the authorisation; and whether or not it will be necessary to retrieve any equipment that is used in the surveillance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to that notification, which involves the provision of specific information, notification of renewal must record: whether this is the first renewal or every occasion on which the authorisation has been renewed previously; every respect in which the information in the previous authorisation has changed; why it is necessary to continue with the authorisation; the content and value to the investigation of the product so far obtained through the surveillance; the results of periodic reviews that are carried out by the authorising officer; and an estimate of the time during which the authorisation will continue to be necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the detail that is required conveys the seriousness with which we have taken the consultative process and its results, and the seriousness that those seeking authorisation and those who are being required to consider it give to what we accept is an intrusion into individual privacy and liberty—but which is, nevertheless, a necessary intrusion. We are prepared to require all concerned to back that up with the detailed information that is outlined in the code of practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, when notifying a commissioner of the cancellation of an authorisation, the authorising officer must provide details of the time and date when the instruction was given by the authorising officer to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
cease surveillance, the reason why the authorisation was cancelled, the outcome of the investigation and the nature of any criminal proceedings contemplated, and the arrangements for the storage of material obtained as a result of the surveillance, for its review and destruction when it is no longer of use and for the immediate destruction of unrelated material.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that those comprehensive requirements will concentrate and focus the minds of authorising officers and ensure that any decision to authorise intrusive surveillance is fully justified and taken only when there is no reasonable alternative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The implementation of part III of the Police Act 1997 has taken a long time. That was partly because we thought it necessary, on an issue as important as this one, to ensure that consultation was particularly thorough, and because of the need to find the right people to act as commissioners. The police and Customs are keen for the provisions to be implemented quickly to remove any doubt about the lawfulness of their actions. We, too, are keen to commence the provisions as soon as possible. They cannot be commenced until the code of practice is approved by both Houses of Parliament. Therefore, I trust that the Committee will approve the draft orders, which will allow us to proceed with implementation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.41 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Greenway 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ryedale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the Minister that, so soon after our meeting last week, it is a pleasure again to be in Committee Room 9 under your chairmanship, Mrs. Roe. That is the first of three reasons that I am pleased to be able to respond on behalf of the Opposition to what the Minister has said. The second reason is that, not for the first time, we are in a Committee taking forward the work of legislation introduced by the previous Government, in this case the Police Act 1997—an extremely important measure which was the subject of a great deal of constructive debate in Committee and in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is thrice a pleasure because, as we found last week when we were discussing the Forensic Science Service, my memory is clear and sharp on the inquiry by the Select Committee on Home Affairs into organised crime. Its report on that led to many of the measures contained in the 1997 Act. When we undertook that inquiry, members on both sides of the Committee were impressed by the work being carried out, especially by the National Criminal Intelligence Service, by the need for a greater focus on the work of regional crime squads and by the decision to create the National Crime Squad. I remember in particular being in a Committee Room along the Corridor listening to senior officers explaining the great difficulty that they experience when dealing with surveillance issues. We decided that it was necessary to make it clear within legislation precisely the circumstances and the arrangements under which some of the more intrusive surveillance could take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the provisions were first published, they caused a great deal of anxiety and you may recall, Mrs. Roe, receiving representations from local solicitors, the Catholic Church and various other organisations
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0016">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
expressing their entirely understandable concerns about some of the provisions. Today is the culmination of the great deal of work that has been put into ensuring that, as far as is reasonably possible, those concerns have been properly addressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My own view on the matter is that Parliament must achieve a proper balance between the interests of individual civil liberties and the role of a robust but fair arrangement for policing. Having studied the code of practice, I believe that that balance has been struck as far as possible. I do not want to go over all the points that the Minister made but I wish to pick out a few.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the fact that the notes for guidance make clear that this potentially intrusive surveillance is not to be used deliberately as a means of circumventing the requirements of the Interception of Communications Act 1985, but there may be occasions when, through the use of bugging devices, the police will overhear a telephone conversation—not because they are tapping a telephone, but because, through the use of a device, they hear a person speaking into a telephone. That is fundamental.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the Minister about the importance of confidentiality and the problems of incidental intrusion, and I believe that a sensible way of dealing with those matters has been found. I agree with the important safeguards that the commissioner system introduced. Time will tell whether a chief commissioner and six other commissioners is adequate for the police service throughout the country. I do no more than make the point that the urgency provisions are extremely necessary. The circumstances in which they can be used are clear and, as the Minister said, they are not to be routinely used. That suggests that a considerable amount of work will ensue for the commissioners, so their geographical spread and access to them will be important. It will also be important for national police organisations to consult local chief constables on matters that are being dealt with in their areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The code of practice contains important matters relating to the retention and destruction of product, an issue that has exercised many hon. Members and, I dare say, still does. It includes proper provisions for complaints.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, I want to ask the Minister three direct questions. First, as the Minister rightly said, when the code of practice was first published, it was the subject of considerable representation and consultation. Have any further representations been made since the publication of the final draft which we are asked to approve today? Certainly, none have been made to me or to my colleagues in the shadow Home Affairs team. I see the Minister shakes his head, which confirms what I suspected. That is important because it shows that people are in agreement with what has finally been achieved and accept that this is the correct way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the definition of "serious crime" might involve an offence for which a term of imprisonment of at least three years might reasonably be expected, even
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
for a first offence. Will the Minister ensure that that provision is kept under review as sentencing policy and guidance changes?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That leads to my third, most important question. Although we agree with the Government's actions in this regard, and we welcome the enthusiasm with which they have made progress, as the Opposition, we must put down a marker and ask the Minister to tell us his Department's intentions for the review of the workings of the code of practice. For all our enthusiasm, some people are still concerned that it may be a step too far, and we owe it to them to ensure that there is a genuine review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Policing in this country, despite the difficulties with which we are currently faced—which the Minister and I have discussed previously in the House and in television studios, and I hope we will do so again—works largely because of strong public support and strong public consent. As various cases arise, and as the way in which police use intrusive surveillance becomes more obvious, the consent of the public to the way in which such powers are used will give some indication of whether the right balance has been struck.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a happy day for the police service in this country. We look forward to the use of the new powers by the police to bring more and more criminals to book.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.52 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. A. J. Beith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Berwick-upon-Tweed)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We accept that the police require powers of intrusive surveillance to deal with some kinds of serious crime, and that such powers require the strictest safeguards if they are to be permitted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The use of such powers did not begin with the code of practice or the legislation to which it applies; those powers have been used for years. No statutory safeguards existed before the legislation of last year. The legislation would not have included a judicial or quasi-judicial process if my hon. Friends and I had not cut up extremely rough in the closing days of the previous Parliament, which is a time when minority parties have a degree of power that they do not enjoy at other times. We enjoyed ensuring that the legislation changed in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much work has been done since then on the code of practice—I welcome that effort—but we had anxieties about the basic framework that the code of practice cannot resolve. We wanted judicial authorisation, but under the current provisions the same people who approve authorisations will subsequently oversee the whole operation. That is not ideal in our view. The code of practice could—and does to some extent—address some aspects of the basic framework that concern us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of those points of concern is urgency. The exception to the approval procedure that provided for urgency worried us from the beginning. It was a weakness in the Police Act 1997, and we hoped that the draft code would tighten the relevant provisions. No parallel provision exists for an urgency bypass in, for example, the legislation governing the security service
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0017">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
or that governing the interception of telephones. In such cases, the Home Secretary must move fast and grant authorisations quickly. We saw no reason in principle why the more extensive machinery for these approvals should not be required to work urgently when urgency was required, instead of requiring consent to be granted retrospectively. It is the nature of these procedures that a formal case must be prepared, even for authorisation within the police service itself. We saw no reason why it should not be given immediately to the appropriate approving judicial officer, to allow it to be carried out urgently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The work done on the code of practice has, however, made significant improvements in other areas. It now explicitly states that it is
	<br><q><p>"admissible as evidence in criminal and civil proceedings."</p></q>
It contains a definition of serious crime and takes the issue of proportionality a little further, which we greatly welcome. It now states that
	<br><q><p>"no intrusion should be authorised which is out of proportion to the crime committed or planned."</p></q>
In each case, proportionality is important, and I am glad that it has been more effectively reflected in the code.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have made separate representations on the complex issue of religious organisations. The Home Office has done considerable work on the issue, which has taken it deep into Catholic and Protestant theology. The Minister and I belong to a denomination that has no concept of sacramental confession. Its status and the parallel provisions for ministers in other denominations who act as spiritual advisers leave us with a problem. There appears to be an absolute exemption for anyone who goes to a Catholic priest to be given confession. That differs from the approach to ministers of religion in all other Christian denominations and religions. If the police have reason to believe that such a minister is involved in criminal activity, they can justify intrusive surveillance. There might be a case for that. That does not apply, however, if the police suspect a Catholic priest of being involved in criminal activity. The exemption for confession is absolute and not subject to the qualification that exists for a Methodist minister, an imam or a rabbi. That is perhaps an unhappy way in which to frame a code of practice. It results from certain assurances having been given to one denomination before thought had been given to how parallel assurances could be given to other denominations and religions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another area in which the code of practice is an improvement is collateral intrusion, to which there is a much more specific reference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Notification of renewals remains a significant issue. Renewals cannot now be considered urgent, and I am glad that that principle has been recognised. If something needs to be renewed, some planning should go into applying to renew it. Failure to remember that it needed to be renewed is not a good reason for not going through the proper procedure.

The conditions for the retention and destruction of material have been tightened. Material has to be retained for certain purposes. It is important that we review how effectively such safeguards work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My outstanding concerns relate partly to the problem of urgency and partly to the fact that the consent of the owner of a property bypasses the authorisation procedure. If it were felt necessary—I am sure that it never would be—to carry out intrusive surveillance on your property, Mrs. Rowe, and you were the house owner, the full authorisation procedure would be required. If you were a tenant, however, the consent of the owner of the property would render application of the procedure unnecessary. That is a serious weakness in the legislation, which will create two classes of citizens—those who enjoy protection because they are house owners and those who do not because they are on somebody else's property as tenants or in another capacity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The relevant parts of the Act and of the code of practice are surely intended to protect not the ownership of property but the notion of privacy—the notion that the Englishman's home is his castle and that different levels of authorisation are appropriate to a genuinely private place and to other places. For example, intrusive surveillance of somebody in a public park does not attract all of the protections before us. It is reasonable to make that distinction. Somebody's home is, however, somebody's home, and the threshold of authorisation should be just as high regardless of whether he owns it or is the tenant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are wider issues with which the code of practice could not deal and which are receiving increasing intention. They include forms of surveillance that go beyond the code's provisions. Surveillance can be carried out through people's credit card records and mobile telephone emissions. That is a fast-moving area, and a code of practice on which we settle today or a piece of parent legislation that we agreed last year will not keep pace with advancing technology. We are not talking simply about the technology of surveillance, but about the use that authorities—or people who wrongly come into possession of material—can make of that material. Modern computer technology means that little shreds of information on a vast number of people can be sorted far more efficiently that was ever before contemplated, so the boundaries of surveillance widen and widen. The Minister must recognise that we must return to such issues regularly, because of the speed at which surveillance outpaces the legislation that controls it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a fortunate piece of legislation that has so many parents. That is a sign of the degree of consensus that has arisen around the Police Act 1997 and the code of practice on which we are deliberating today. The hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) and the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed can both, in their different ways claim parentage of aspects of the legislation. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary can certainly claim

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
parentage; I fear that I am a mere godfather in the piece, with responsibility for the orders before us today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Greenway</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A foster parent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. Nevertheless, I take that responsibility seriously, as I know the Committee does, because we are dealing with a piece of legislation and a code of practice that authorise a degree of intrusion into the lives—and, as the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed said, into the homes—of our fellow citizens. It is right that we proceed with care and deliberation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Tyedale asked how we propose to keep the matter under review. It will be necessary to do so, and I have no doubt that, as the years progress and technology develops, it will be necessary for the House to return to the subject—as the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed pointed out. More immediately, the code provides for the chief commissioner to make
	<br><q><p>"an annual report to the Prime Minister on the discharge of functions—</p></q>
the chief commissioner's functions—
	<br><q><p>"under this Act, and reporting at any other time on any matter relating to those functions."</p></q>
It also provides for the chief commissioner to keep under review the functions of authorising officers and commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That will be an important role for the chief commissioner, as will be his contact with the Home Secretary. It is important that he should have regard to the development of practice and the experience of authorising officers and commissioners under the Act. He will certainly do so—he takes that responsibility very seriously. So the matter will be subject to review to ensure that we balance the liberty of the individual with the proper concern that we have as a society to protect ourselves from serious crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ryedale, who speaks for the official Opposition, raised the question of the definition of serious crime. It will be important to have regard to that and to the development of sentencing policy. However, I hope that the two parts of the definition—paragraphs (a) and (b)—will be sufficient to keep pace with the pattern of criminality and public concern. The definition places a proper emphasis on violence, substantial gain and the conduct of large numbers of persons in pursuit of a common purpose, in addition to the reference to sentencing, to which the hon. Gentleman referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the two prongs of the definition of serious offence will ensure that we can use the legislation against the people at whom it is directed—those who threaten and imperil the lives of their fellow citizens through serious crime. I know that hon. Members of all parties are under no illusions about the foes whom the police, Customs and those responsible
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
for criminal intelligence are up against. Such people are unscrupulous and dangerous and can use new technology in a way that imperils everybody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A balance must be struck. I hear what the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed says about private and tenanted property. The difficulty with his comments is that the code can reflect only the Act. The right hon. Gentleman's points relate to the Act. The code can reflect only forms of surveillance that come within the terms of part III of the Act. When the property owner gives consent, interference with the property of the target of authorisation would not occur under the terms of the Act. The right hon. Gentleman objected to that part of the Act, but the debate that he sought was closed when the Act took effect. The Committee is now addressing the code, so there is not the opportunity for the right hon. Gentleman to cut up rough, as he put it. I have witnessed the right hon. Gentleman cutting up rough, and it is not a pretty sight. I should tell newer hon. Members that I would not recommend it to anybody. I expressed some anxiety to my officials before the sitting, seeking assurance that such an occurrence was not likely today. Indeed, Mrs. Rowe, your powers as Chairman have not been stretched by the right hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the Minister's point and his vivid description of me, which, of course, I do not recognise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister consider allowing the police to use the approval procedures as a routine, even in cases in which the property in question is tenanted? In some circumstances, it may not be wise to initiate inquiries about who owns the property, and it may be simpler to follow the same procedure without investigating whether the property is owned by the occupant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That might be the case, but it is an operational matter for those responsible for such investigations to decide. The question might be reasonably taken into account. When alerting the owner to the fact that a surveillance might mean that the occupier is tipped off, it would make sense to take the route suggested by the right hon. Gentleman. That is an operational matter that the Government would be content to leave to officers on the ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a balance to be struck. I hope that the Government have struck it with the code, and that the Committee will give the orders a fair wind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
