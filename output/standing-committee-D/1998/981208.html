Draft Parole Board (Transfer of Functions) Order 1998</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. George Howarth)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Parole Board (Transfer of Functions) Order 1998.</p></blockquote>
We all appreciate your presence, Mr. Cunningham, in the Chair today. I know that you will, as usual, keep us in order fairly and properly.<br><br>
The order was laid before the House on 17 November 1998. It will be made under section 50(1) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991, and will extend the powers delegated to the parole board by the Secretary of State. Specifically, the board will have the authority to take decisions on the grant of parole to determinate sentence prisoners who are serving a sentence of up to, but not including, 15 years. At present the board has such decision-making powers in respect of determinate sentence prisoners serving up to seven years. The order does not deal with the arrangements for considering the release of discretionary or mandatory life sentence prisoners. There are no plans to change those arrangements.<br><br>
The order is part of the Government's wider commitment to modernising and improving the performance of the criminal justice system. The Prison Service has a central role in taking forward that programme of change and in working with other criminal justice agencies to develop more effective ways of protecting the public.<br><br>
The parole system, which was introduced in its current form by the Criminal Justice Act, plays an important part in reducing the cycle of offending behaviour and hence reducing the overall level of serious crime. In particular, parole offers a valuable incentive to prisoners convicted of more serious crimes to address the root causes of their offending behaviour while in custody. Decisions about parole are primarily based on risk. For the parole system to operate effectively, and in order to maintain public confidence, the evaluation of risk must be undertaken extremely carefully. Above all, decisions on releasing prisoners on parole must consider the need to protect the public. It is a testimony to the success of the process that only about 5 per cent, of prisoners released on parole are recalled for reoffending while on licence.<br><br>
Along with the importance of effective decision making, the Government are conscious of the importance of timely decisions, both for prisoners and to ensure the most efficient and effective use of prison accommodation. The Prison Service is working with
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
the parole board to reduce delays. A range of improvements to existing procedures is being introduced to make the parole process more efficient. These actions are supported by independent research and audit projects. The goal is to ensure that prisoners regarded as suitable for early release are dealt with accordingly.<br><br>
In that context, the Government have reviewed the way in which parole decisions are taken in cases involving determinate sentence prisoners. The parole board currently has delegated authority, under the Parole Board (Transfer of Functions) Order 1992, to take decisions on the grant of parole to determinate sentence prisoners who are serving sentences of at least four years and less that seven years, and who were sentenced after 1 October 1992.<br><br>
In other cases involving determinate sentence prisoners, the parole board performs an advisory function, and final decisions are taken by Ministers, or by the Prison Service on behalf of Ministers. Last year, the board's recommendations for release were agreed in all but two of 520 cases, which clearly underlines the quality and consistency of the board's decision making and raises questions about the need for the board's recommendations to be subject to review before a final decision is made.<br><br>
The Government therefore take the view that the parole board's delegated authority should be extended. We published our proposals on 6 October in a consultation paper entitled "Improving Parole Decision-Making". At the end of the consultation period, on 4 November, we had received 38 responses to the paper, 33 of which fully supported it. The other five offered differing degrees of support. The proposals also have the full support of the parole board's chairman and chief executive.<br><br>
The proposals outlined in the consultation paper are now set out in the order. The central proposal is to extend the parole board's decision-making powers to cover prisoners who are sentenced to determinate sentences of up to, but not including, 15 years. There is no magic reason for moving the cut-off point from seven to 15 years. Certainly, there is no direct correlation between the length of sentence and the complexity of the parole decision. Wherever the line is drawn, the board is likely to be faced with a small number of complex or contentious cases.<br><br>
We aimed to strike a balance between removing the existing inefficiencies in the system and ensuring that decisions to release offenders who are responsible for committing the most serious offences would be subject to ministerial veto. Prisoners serving longer sentences are likely to include those who were considered to be a significant danger to the public when they were sentenced. There is clearly a public interest argument for allowing decisions in such cases to involve an element of review, including the possibility of referral to Ministers in particularly contentious cases. Importantly, the vast majority of the correspondents to our consultation exercise agreed, in relation to this issue, that 15 years was an appropriate threshold. The order therefore sets out proposals for extending the scope of the parole board's delegated authority to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0200">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
encompass cases of determinate sentence involving sentences of up to, but not including, 15 years. That will include those who were sentenced before 1992, who are not covered by the present provisions.<br><br>
The order also reflects the need for transitional arrangements in cases where the parole board has made a recommendation prior to being granted its new powers, but where the Secretary of State has not acted on it. We propose to limit the parole board's new powers to take final decisions to those cases to be considered by the parole board after the new order comes into force. Cases where the parole board has made a recommendation prior to the order coming into force, but on which a final decision has not yet been reached, will be dealt with under the current procedures.<br><br>
Increasing the scope of the board's delegated authority to take such decisions would be a positive recognition of the quality of the parole board's assessments in these cases. It would also allow decisions to be made more quickly. I commend the draft order to the Committee.</span></p>
<p>4.37 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Clappison <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hertsmere)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I unreservedly endorse the Minister's comments in welcoming you to the Chair, Mr. Cunningham. It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship this afternoon.<br><br>
I thank the Minister for his courtesy in forwarding to me a copy of the responses to the consultation paper "Improving Parole Decision-Making", to which he has just referred. The Committee will known from what the Minister said that the order raises important issues of public safety. The Opposition have a number of questions and concerns to put to the Minister. I should say at the outset that the issues to which I shall refer reflect our overriding concern that the protection of the public should be paramount; it should not be diminished by any new arrangements that are entered into.<br><br>
First, will the Minister confirm that the order embodies in substance the proposals in the consultation paper? The consultation paper contains a draft order that is slightly different from the draft order that is before us today, but I understand that the substance is the same. The Minister will perhaps understand when I say that the explanatory notes that are appended to draft orders are not always as clear as they might be. The consultation paper makes things a good deal clearer.<br><br>
In our view, the most important issue at stake is the role of the parole board in the case of prisoners serving sentences of between seven and 15 years. The Government's case is that the present arrangements will be changed. As matters stand, the parole board may make recommendations to the Secretary of State in the case of prisoners serving sentences of between seven and 15 years. Final decisions on parole for such prisoners are, however, taken by Ministers or on their behalf by the Prison Service parole unit. In the case of longer-term sentences of between four and seven years, the decision is taken entirely by the parole board.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
As a result of the changes that the order makes, decisions concerning parole for prisoners who are serving between seven and 15 years will be taken by the parole board, without the review by the Secretary of State to which I adverted. Final authority will no longer rest with the Secretary of State but with the parole board. That is an important switch of responsibility, which places delegated authority in the hands of the parole board. We have several questions about that.<br><br>
First, does the Minister agree that prisoners who are serving sentences of seven to 15 years are likely to include a substantial number who are considered a significant danger to the public? Does he agree that they will include many who are serving sentences for armed robbery—which commonly involves sentences of that length?<br><br>
Is the Minister satisfied that 15 years is the right point at which to draw the line? He said in his opening remarks that there was no magic about 15 years. We should, however, like to hear a little more about the thought that the Government must have given to drawing the line at 15 years and about why they did not consider it appropriate to draw it earlier. The Criminal Bar Association, which is well placed to assess the seriousness of offences and sentences, has suggested that the line should be drawn at 10 years so that Minister still have responsibility for the most serious offenders.<br><br>
The Minister said that decisions about parole for somebody who was serving a sentence of 14 years might be as complex as those for somebody who was serving a sentence of between four and seven years. That might well be the case, and the decision might be made more complex by the risk of reoffending. The Minister must accept, however, that there is a greater risk of more serious offences being committed by those who are serving the longer sentences of between 10 and 15 years.<br><br>
The Minister said that 5 per cent. of those who were admitted to parole were convicted of offences. I take it that that statistic refers to offences that were committed during the period of licence on parole. I look to the Minister to correct me on that. That could, nevertheless, amount to a substantial number of serious offences. Let us take the case that the Government has given of the 518 offenders who were serving between seven and 15 years and who were granted parole. If 5 per cent. of them offend, that gives us, according to my imperfect maths, a figure of some 25 serious offences just during the period in which those offenders are on licence. We are talking about serious matters and serious offences.<br><br>
What thought did the Government give to excluding certain offences from their general approach to sentences of between seven and 15 years? The consultation paper states:
<br><blockquote><p>"the types of offences would be difficult to specify without casting the net so wide that the objectives of change would be lost".</p></blockquote>
With great respect, I detect a certain amount of bureaucratese in that statement. Why would it be impossible to exclude some offences? Among those prisoners who are serving between seven and 15 years
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0201">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
and who are eligible for parole are some sex offenders. Do they not present particular difficulties when it comes to weighing up whether to grant parole? Do they not constitute the gravest of concerns to the public? Perhaps only a few sex offenders are admitted to parole. The Opposition would be interested to obtain the figures from the Minister. How many of the 518 offenders granted parole in 1997–98 were sex offenders?<br><br>
Does the Minister recognise that many branches of legislation contain special provisions relating to sex offenders, and that, under the Sex Offenders Act 1997, it is possible to specify sexual offences? Is he satisfied that no argument exists in favour of reviewing decisions taken by the parole board relating to sex offenders serving between seven and 15 years? Will he supply one more statistic? How many sex offenders to whom that range of sentence—seven to 15 years— applies would be eligible for parole?<br><br>
The consultation paper states that all but two of 520 parole board recommendations were approved in 1997–98, as the Minister said. We are told that in the unapproved cases Ministers took the view that evidence was insufficient to suggest that the risk of reoffending had been reduced. Will the Minister give us more detail, within the bounds of propriety, on what can be asked about such cases? Will he tell us, for example, what type of offences were involved in the two cases in which parole was refused because of a review carried out by the Secretary of State? In how many cases since revised directions were issued by the Secretary of State in 1996 have Ministers not approved parole board recommendations?<br><br>
It would appear from the consultation paper that saving money is the main reason for removing the element of review by the Secretary of State through the parole unit of the Prison Service. The consultation paper mentions a figure of between £70,000 and £75,000. Will the Minister tell us how such savings could be made, and how the money will be spent? He knows that that matter is of some interest to at least one respondent to the consultation paper.<br><br>
Finally, I should like to speak about the most important subject. I know that hon. Members will be interested in it, as it involves protecting the public from offencing. Does the Minister believe that a saving of about £70,000 to £75,000 justifies the removal of the element of review under the present system, which the Government's consultation paper identifies as a "clear public interest argument"? Will he assure us that the order will not lessen the protection from serious offenders that is given to the public?</span></p>
<p>4.47 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) raised a number of issues. I have tried my best to keep up, and if I neglect to answer any questions he will no doubt let me know.<br><br>
First, he asked whether the order was substantively the same as the consultation paper. I confirm that substantially and in all important respects they share
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
the same approach, and that there is no difference between them that need detain or concern the Committee.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked several questions about the categories. No distinction is drawn between the categories of prisoners involved in the present system in the way that he described. He said that the order would change the current system, because Ministers have previously been involved in decisions. He should not be so concerned. There is very little difference between the consideration given by the parole board and the final decisions made by Ministers, as the hon. Gentleman acknowledged. We do not just rubber stamp cases; we examine them carefully, but by and large the decisions that we make are guided by the parole board—by and large it makes the right decisions.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also asked why we have arrived at the period of 15 years, when others have suggested a 10-year maximum. As I said earlier, 15 years is not a magical date, but we think that it is about right, considering what has happened in the past and bearing in mind the need for greater efficiency. No one could say that 10, 11 or 12 years would be any better. Obviously, we need to keep an eye on the situation. We want to try 15 years. If it quickly becomes apparent that that is not as sensible as we envisage, we will obviously review the provision. I do not think that any problems will be created, but if there is concern, we will return to the matter.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman gave as examples of serious offences armed robbery and sexual offences. It is difficult to give practical examples—the hon. Gentleman conceded that that would raise problems of propriety—and I do not have any examples to hand.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point of propriety related to the two cases that were refused—the two that we know about. I know that it may be difficult to identify individual prisoners—that may give rise to problems of propriety—but I was asking about the general type of offence involved. I do not think that the question of propriety arises in identifying how many sexual offenders or how many armed robbers fall within the range of seven to 15-year sentences.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I intended to say that such a breakdown is not available to me. Although it will not help the hon. Gentleman in today's deliberations, I will let him have any information that we possess.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman should take into account that it is only after the most rigorous risk assessment that such decisions are taken. That applies in every case, whether the offence is serious or less serious—anyone serving a 15-year sentence is unlikely to be a minor offender. The most rigorous risk assessment takes place; that is an important part of the process.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also asked about efficiency and the amount of money involved. The figure that he cited is accurate. Of course, we want greater efficiency, and we believe that the proposals represent a better use of resources. I cannot identify precisely where the money will go, but the proposal was part of the comprehensive spending review. Sums from general
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0202">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
spending on the Prison Service and under other Home Office heads have been identified as part of the comprehensive spending review. If the hon. Gentleman wants me to describe how the comprehensive spending review redistributed resources, I can do so. For example, he will know that expenditure on drug prevention formed a part of that review. However, the position is not straightforward. Part of the savings will be needed by the parole board to operate the system; part will go to developing new constructive regimes within the Prison Service, on which we are keen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is now coming to the point that I was trying to get at. When I asked where the money will go, I wanted to know whether it will go either generally—as he first described—or specifically to develop constructive regimes. The consultation paper says that savings will be directly recycled in the Prison Service's broader responsibility for developing constructive regimes. However, that is only a consultation paper: can the Minister confirm that that will be the case?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I can confirm that that will be the case. However, it is important to make it clear that some of that flows from the comprehensive spending review. For example, the hon. Gentleman will recall that, earlier in the year, as one of our approaches to a constructive regime, additional sources were made available to provide drug treatment for people while they were serving a custodial sentence. So that is the intention.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
I hope that I have covered most of the hon. Gentleman's points; if not, he will no doubt remind me. Ultimately, it is a question of balance. I think that we probably have the balance right, but if evidence emerges that the system is not working as we envisage, we shall want to revisit it. I hope that that reassures the Committee that this is a sensible measure, and that we shall keep a careful eye on it. It reflects long experience of the way in which parole board decisions work.<br><br>
I have a final point to make about the need for vigilance. Although Ministers will inevitably be involved in fewer decisions of this kind, the framework within which those decisions will be made will be set by the Home Secretary, in consultation with other Ministers in the Department. Thus our involvement will still be directed towards protecting the public and taking great care, when making these decisions, that we are not releasing the wrong sort of people too early, with an unacceptable risk to the public. Neither I nor the Secretary of State would do that, and we are confident that the co-operation and vigilance with which the parole board will continue to take these decisions—in greater volume, in this case—will be such that there is no cause for alarm.</span></p>
