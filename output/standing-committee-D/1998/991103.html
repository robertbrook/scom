	<div class='legislation'>Draft Licensing and Registered Clubs (Northern Ireland) Order 1999</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. George Howarth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Licensing and Registered Clubs (Northern Ireland) Order 1999.</p></blockquote>
The draft order is intended to allow licensed premises—other than off-licences—and registered clubs in Northern Ireland to stay open for the sale or supply of alcohol throughout the night of the millennium new year's eve, if they wish to do so. I stress that it is a choice, not a requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To achieve that, the order broadly provides a 12-and-a-half-hour relaxation of the general permitted hours for these premises from 11 pm, the normal closing time, on 31 December 1999 until 11.30 am, the normal opening time, on 1 January 2000. The order also extends the duration of occasional licences granted for 31 December 1999. I should emphasise that the order does not apply to off-licences, nor does it allow off-sales during the new year additional hours; alcohol sold or supplied during those hours must be consumed on the premises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An order in Council is normally published for public comment. Unfortunately, that has not been possible for this order because of the need to have the legislation in operation for the millennium holiday. However, the Government's decision to relax licensing hours for this one-off occasion was taken in the light of responses to a consultation paper issued to a wide range of interests last December. The consultation exercise did not provide sufficient support to justify a relaxation of licensing hours for every new year's eve. The support for some change was, however, considered sufficient to justify a 12-and-a-half-hour relaxation specifically for the millennium—an event that many people would accept as a unique occasion to be marked by special celebrations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Deregulation (Millennium Licensing) Order 1999 allows similar premises in England and Wales to open throughout the night of the millennium new year's eve. In England and Wales, unlike Northern Ireland, provision is made for restriction orders to prevent all or any of the additional hours from applying in certain premises. Similar provision for Northern Ireland would be impractical because the order cannot come into operation before the beginning of December, which is too late for the processing of applications, hearings and any other procedures which may be necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I emphasise that, although the order extends the general permitted hours for the premises involved, the existing safeguards in law for those hours
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
will continue to apply. I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.33 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Moss 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Cambridgeshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I begin by welcoming the Minister to his new position in the Northern Ireland Office. He served with distinction in his previous post; no doubt his new post will enable him to make his own mark in a special way in a special Province. He has inherited some of the jobs that I carried out in my previous life, including addressing the vexatious problem of licensing hours in Northern Ireland. It was one of the first problems on my desk when I arrived at the Northern Ireland Office, and it took me nearly two years to get the Licensing (Northern Ireland) Order 1996 through the House. It is a particularly difficult problem for Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that the Minister has inherited a policy decision taken by his predecessor and so cannot be held responsible in any way for the outcome. It is a contentious matter and we support the broad principle of what is proposed. It simply brings Northern Ireland into line with England and Wales for one special occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a few questions for the Minister, who kindly sent me a letter on the matter before the order was laid. The decision was based on consultation up to that time; some 102 letters had been received, which appears to be a low response on the issue of licensing and the extension of hours. Was the change given enough publicity and are 102 responses, which were evenly balanced between the pros and cons, enough to reflect full and open consultation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that, given the moves towards devolution and the fact that some decisions were put on the back burner in the hope that they would be taken more locally in a devolved Administration, someone had to take the bull by the horns. I suspect that that is what happened in this case. However, if 102 responses were evenly balanced, I am puzzled why the Government concluded that the overall representation was in favour of change. Some people who made representations might not have sent letters. Did the Minister or his predecessor attend meetings at which counter-views were put?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There would be problems if the order were held up. The objective is clearly stated in the memorandum which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The measure is primarily intended to facilitate the Millennium celebrations by relaxing licensing hours but will also have the advantage of removing the requirement to apply to the courts and police for extended hours for the eve of the Millennium."</p></blockquote>
Given the delay in laying the order, has the Minister's Department advised those involved that there is no need to apply for an extension of hours on that evening, or have organisations applied through the normal channels? If so, how much money and time has been expended unnecessarily by those organisations?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government suggest in paragraph 4 of the memorandum
	<br><blockquote><p>"That the proposal is estimated to offer savings of £200,000 primarily for licensed premises."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0642">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
However, if some of those premises have already applied for an extension, that amount will decrease. The Government also suggest that there will be savings for the police. I accept that savings will be made through not having to deal with applications for extended licences, but in a net context I cannot believe that the millennium in any way, shape or form will lead to savings for the police.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The chief constable of my county, Cambridgeshire, told me that almost £1 million has been set aside for the millennium. I realise that that matter does not come within the ambit of the Minister's responsibilities and that some of the potential expense may be attributable to the millennium bug, but a great deal of it is for extra policing for the millennium celebrations. lit is misleading for his Department to say that the police will make savings without explaining that there will be no overall net saving because of the heavy burden imposed on the public purse by the need to police the occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 4(4)(b) deals with the giving of licences as they relate to
	<br><blockquote><p>"authorisation granted under Article 45 of the Licensing Order",</p></blockquote>
which refers to the 1996 order. That order refers to special occasions on which licensed premises may apply for an extension to their licensing hours—20 late-night openings are allowed in any 12-month period. There is a later reference to the permitted late-night opening hours of clubs—under article 8, 52 late-night openings are allowed in a calendar year. Does the order that we are considering impinge on the allowance of extensions to late-night opening under existing legislation, or will it develop it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.40 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Belfast, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome the Minister to his post. I have already corresponded with him on issues and his responses have been gracious and helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss) spoke of savings, but savings are unlikely to accrue if, for instance, the Army has to be called out to prevent revellers at the dome from falling into the Thames. The harsh financial reality of such an event might impinge on security in Northern Ireland, where police officers are not on night duty in strength.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order has been introduced for several reasons. I suspect that, once its principle has been accepted, points raised about special licences might be developed further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I and others are glad that hype about the millennium is beginning to be challenged. Parties arranged in Northern Ireland have been cancelled because people were not prepared to spend the sums requested. One must recognise that a reason for the order is not only to allow people in Northern Ireland and in the rest of the United Kingdom to enjoy themselves at the millennium but to raise funds for the Government, who will receive a revenue rake-off if more spirits and liquor are sold. However, as has already been suggested, there will also be great public expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Speaking of enjoyment, I should mention that I was once asked whether I enjoyed myself. I replied that I did, but that I was able to remember doing so in the morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The millennium celebration should be made into an opportunity for proper family reunions; instead, it might lead to the division of families and especially to many young people being led down a path that they would do better not to follow. However, the order has been introduced, and it is not likely that it will be stopped. We shall watch what the Budget discloses about expenditure on public services and income for the Exchequer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Alternatively, the Government and Opposition might be using the occasion to try again to get us to forget what this millennium has been about; on the morning of 1 January many folk will have to try to remember what happened on the previous night.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.43 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lembit Öpik 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister to his new post. A propos of what we have just heard, I note that it is said of people who do not drink that they do not live longer, it just seems that they do
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is for individuals to choose how they bring in the new millennium. I hope that, in Northern Ireland and in the rest of the United Kingdom, people will act responsibly. We support the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.44 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Robathan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Blaby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the benefit of the Committee, will the Minister explain what a nightworkers club is? I am surely not the only one who does not known. I am sure that we all understand the concept of a nightworker, and of a nightworker having a club, but how specifically does such a club differ from any other?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.44 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Members for North-East Cambridgeshire, for Montgomeryshire (Mr. Öpik) and for Belfast, South (Rev. Martin Smyth) for their words of welcome. I also thank the hon. Member for Blaby (Mr. Robathan) for his visual assent to their kind words. I shall try to deal with the points that were made, and especially with those made by the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Existing laws allow for limited late-night extensions of opening hours up to 1 am. The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire was interested to know how the extensions would work in practice. The order's extension of general permitted hours means that any such late-night extensions granted by the courts or by the police for the millennium new year's eve will overlap with new year additional hours and are therefore unnecessary. For that reason, the order provides that such late-night extensions will have no effect. I reassure the hon. Gentleman on that point; as he correctly said, paragraphs (3), (4), (5) and (6) of article 4 deal with the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire also spoke about savings for the police. The Government do not claim that such savings will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0643">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
necessarily be made on policing of the millennium and of the events that may occur then. I do not have figures to hand, but I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Minister responsible for policing and security will make appropriate arrangements for policing to cover any eventualities because of the millennium. Those arrangements will take account of public order concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have police support for the proposals. The police would argue that additional costs could be incurred at a specific point during the night in question if everybody were to leave licensed premises and to come on to the street at the same time. A saving will presumably be made because such an intensity of policing will not be needed at one particular hour; the time at which people decide to leave licensed premises will be a matter of consumer choice. Other than the most hardy souls, it is unlikely that anybody without a very strong constitution would take advantage of the whole period available for making use of licensed premises, those people will certainly not include the hon. Member of Belfast, South or me, although the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire may be one of them—I could not possible say. Any additional costs will arise because of the general event, and will not necessarily be related to licensed premises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general policy on policing and security during the millennium celebrations will be properly considered. My right hon. Friend the Minister will consult the police and other emergency organisations to ensure that that is the case. Article 4 covers licensed premises, and article 8 covers clubs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire raised other issues regarding consultation. He was right to say that 102 responses had been received, and the figure has not changed since I write to him on the subject. The response was evenly balanced, and we had to decide whether it was a good or bad thing to go ahead. On balance, we decided that it was right to do so, as there was no public outrage about the matter, which we believe is one of choice. It is for people in individual premises to decide whether they feel that it is commercially viable to stay open, and it is for consumers to decide whether they want to take advantage of such opening hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, the responses were evenly balanced. The consultation was wide—we contacted all the trade organisations and advertisements were placed in the three main newspapers in Northern Ireland. I give the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire an undertaking to ensure that the implications of this measure—assuming that the Committee is happy for it to proceed—will be widely publicised, and that those who need to know will know. I assure him, too, that we will do that in the most cost-effective way possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Blaby, who spoke briefly, asked for a definition of a nightworkers club. To be recognised as a nightworkers club, a court must be
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
satisfied that its members cannot take advantage of normal permitted hours because of their unusual working hours, and that the club rules prohibit guests from its premises between midnight and 10 am. That is covered by article 5(1)(b) of the Registration of Clubs (Northern Ireland) Order 1996—the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire toiled mightily to get that on to the statute book. I suspect that the Strangers' Bar tonight might provide the hon. Member for Blaby with a good example of a nightworkers club if we keep the hours tonight that I am led to understand we are likely to; of course, that may be more in the hon. Gentleman's hands and in those of his right hon. and hon. Friends than in mine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has not answered one of my questions. If he cannot answer it now, I am more than happy to receive a response in writing. With regard to the timing of the order, I asked whether sufficient information had been given to those who would ordinarily apply for licences for an extension. Have a proportion already done so and incurred some cost, or did the Government tell the industry to hang back on the grounds that this measure would clear the way for an automatic extension? I just wondered whether the £200,000 saving was an accurate figure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the hon. Gentleman; he did indeed ask that question. The trade has been kept fully in touch with developments on this issue, but it was not possible to advise against applications before the order was approved, for the obvious reason that it would be an abuse of this House for us to presume that that would happen. As I said, once the order is made, we will notify all the major trade and other interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot give the hon. Gentleman an estimate of costs, but those who have made contact and shown any concern will have been given a fairly broad hint about what is involved. I doubt very much whether there have been any extraordinary costs. I had some dealings with the licensed trade when I was a Minister in the Home Office; in my experience, its practitioners are usually pretty shrewd at working out when to do things and when not to. They conduct themselves in a very businesslike way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall of course scrutinise 	<i>Hansard</i> to ensure that I have covered all the issues and, if necessary, I shall respond in writing to the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire or to any other hon. Members. I hope that, having heard my responses, the Committee will feel that it is appropriate to approve the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Dowd), who should not normally be referred to, suggested that I say at this point that the drinks are on me. However, knowing my hon. Friend's generosity, I think that they are on him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
