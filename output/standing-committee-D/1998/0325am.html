Standing Committee D</div> <!-- title -->
<time>Thursday 25 March 1999</time>
<p><i>(Morning)</i></p>
<p>[MR. JOHN MCWILLIAM <i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
<div class='debates'>
<section>
<div class='page-header'><h1>Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill</h1></div>
<p>10 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Room has a tendency to become very warm because of the shatter-proof double glazing—it is an emergency Room for use in case of a threat—so hon. Gentlemen may remove their jackets.<br><br>
There is a draught coming from the window and I have sent for the window engineer. Unfortunately, he will have to bring a ladder into the Room, so when that happens I shall suspend the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies <span class='memberconstituency'>(Grantham and Stamford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. You will recall that I undertook to try to catch your eye this morning if I had been able to establish the truth of the matter that was in dispute between the Minister and I during our previous sitting. It concerned whether the assets to be split on divorce in Scotland are only the assets acquired or accumulated during the course of a marriage. I have been able to do that and I refer the Committee to page 85 of the Select Committee report and the evidence of Mr. Talman for the Law Society of Scotland, who said in reply to question 425:
<br><blockquote><p>"In Scotland we have this window period from marriage to the end of cohabitation or service of the summons, and it is only during that period that the matrimonial property builds up".</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Gravesham (Mr. Pond) knows the truth of the matter, even if his Minister does not, because he asked a question of Mr. Sax of the Solicitors' Family Law Association. In question 358 on page 75 the hon. Gentleman said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I understand that in the Scottish system it is only the assets accrued during the marriage which are taken into account."</p></blockquote>
Mr Sax replied, "Yes."<br><br>
The Minister owes an apology not so much to the Committee, but to the people of Scotland for whom new Labour English Ministers are patronisingly legislating when they do not even know the fundamentals of Scottish matrimonial law.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is not a point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security (Mr. Stephen Timms)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. I, too, have examined the Select Committee's report and have noted the comment on this matter in the main body of the report. My comment at our previous sitting was correct and assets brought to the marriage may count in certain circumstances. I said that I would write to the hon. Gentleman. I shall be happy to do so and I shall copy that letter to all Committee members so that the position is absolutely clear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The only point of order would have been if an hon. Member had attempted to mislead the Committee. Clearly that has not happened. There was simply a disagreement.</span></p>

BEREAVEMENT PAYMENTS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eric Pickles <span class='memberconstituency'>(Brentwood and Ongar)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 202, in page 39, line 34, after "day", insert
<br><blockquote><p>"or a bereaved person aged 60 to 64 when the spouse died.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 102, in page 39, line 39, leave out "and" and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"or () that the person was of pensionable age and in receipt of income support; and".</p></blockquote>
I call Mr. Pickles to speak to the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Several hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'>: "Hear, hear!"</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am overwhelmed by that spirit of friendship. I am feeling much better than when we last met and I am pleased to say that the particular form of black death that my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies) brought to the Committee is gradually working its way along the Benches. I understand that the hon. Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten) is the latest victim.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. As long as it becomes increasingly virulent as it goes, I hope that it keeps on going in that direction.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We now move to a new part of this enormous Bill. We have discussed stakeholder pensions, which are unlikely to impinge on the public's consciousness because no one will be interested in them. We have had problems with pension splitting and, despite our best efforts, we have been unable to take steps to prevent that becoming a source of problems for the courts in years to come.<br><br>
We now move on to a matter of increasing concern for the public: the abolition of widows' pension. The measure represents a broken contract between the state and the general public. The Government have no mandate to introduce it; I am not aware of its being in the Labour party manifesto. I have made an extensive search on the internet, and I can find no record in the news services of any member of the Labour party suggesting this measure before the election.<br><br>
I warned Committee members at the beginning of this Committee stage that we would all become rather accustomed to one another. I was able to get my daily dose of the Under-Secretary of State yesterday during proceedings to consider a statutory instrument, at which he made an interesting point that relates directly to the amendment. He spoke of the growth of means-tested benefits, and cited this measure as an example of moving in the opposite direction, and of the contributory principle being extended. That was an extraordinary assertion to make. Most people who have studied the matter readily state that the effect will be exactly the reverse.<br><br>
An assumption used to exist about the nature of the contract between the state and the individual, which can be stated simply: if a man paid his national insurance, and made his contributions regularly and diligently, his widow would receive benefits and a pension in the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0732">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 475</span>
unfortunate event of his demise. That was clearly understood, and people used to take that into consideration when putting together a financial package to ensure that their loved one would be taken care of when they died. I shall go into greater detail on that subject when we reach the relevant amendments.<br><br>
For many Labour Committee members, today—25 March—is an important day, especially for those with marginal seats. I say this with a heavy heart, because over the weeks that we have sat together in Committee, I have grown to know the Labour Members and a certain bond has been established between us. That bond is not dissimilar to that between captors and their hostages—eventually they start to have feelings for each other.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am glad that the hon. Gentleman sympathises with me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I dare say, Mr. McWilliam, that when the gentleman comes to fix the window, we could decide which of us would like to be chained together on a radiator. I bags first choice.<br><br>
I say with a heavy heart that the outcome of our consideration of these amendments could cost Labour Members in marginal constituencies their seats. There will be a considerable outcry about this measure. Hon. Members should not be fooled into thinking that, because our discussions are taking place in Committee, with limited press coverage and few members of the public present, it will not become known that they voted to abolish a substantial benefit that has been available to women since the second world war.<br><br>
We need to give the bereaved the financial resources that will offer them greater freedom. That is the nature of money. It gives people the opportunity to choose from the options that are available to them during bereavement. It gives them—this should not be underestimated—time to grieve, to come to terms with their loss, and to start the difficult process of rebuilding their lives. It also reduces their worries when dealing with loss and everything involved with bereavement. Anyone who has experienced bereavement, or seen a close relative or friend experience it, knows what it is like. The benefit helps to reduce their worries about other things—about where the next penny will come from, the bills, obtaining probate and getting the will sorted out. It eases their minds just a little bit.<br><br>
The amendment would ensure that the £2,000 bereavement payment, which, under the proposals, will not be payable to widows over 60, will be paid to all bereaved persons between the age of 60 and 64. That is the sole purpose of the amendment. That would lend truth to the Chancellor's promise in the supporting documents to the Budget. The Chancellor was remarkably silent about the abolition of widow's bereavement allowance, but reference to it is contained in the various documents that were submitted with the Budget in the Inland Revenue No. 1 press release.<br><br>
The matter is not referred to directly in the text, just as the Chancellor did not refer to it directly. It is frustrating
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 476</span>
to have to wade through so many documents to find out the precise position, which appears in an obscure note in points 4 to 6.<br><br>
Hon. Members will recall that the Chancellor abolished married couples' allowance. As someone who has chaired many Finance Bills, Mr. McWilliam—I think you said it was two—you will know that several maintenance benefits are tagged on to married couple's allowance, one of which is the widow's bereavement allowance. The other benefits, which are generally worth roughly the same as married couple's allowance, will be abolished from April 2000. That is fairly straightforward.<br><br>
The Chancellor goes on to say that WBA is given to widows for up to two years. The Inland Revenue No. 1 press release, "Budget 99" states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Widows will be more than compensated for the loss of this allowance by the proposed Bereavement Payment in the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill."</p></blockquote>
That should be available to widows and widowers, and it should help taxpayers and non—taxpayers alike.<br><br>
One could argue that the bereavement payment will make a small contribution to those who are below the age of 60. However, it will not be available for those aged between 60 and 64. The proposal will simply help the Government and the Chancellor. The anomaly relating to those aged between 60 and 64 might result in the Chancellor's misleading the House, which I am sure Committee members want to avoid at all costs.<br><br>
10.15 am<br><br>
I am a trusting Member of Parliament, and I assumed that when I arrived in the Committee this morning I would come across a Government amendment, and that an enormous love fest would take place between the Minister of State and me. I would have said, "I withdraw my amendment and congratulate the Minister on his fine approach to the matter." There would have been much happiness and conviviality, and the Government Whip, whose constituency, I think, is Burnley—I mean Barnsley—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Employment, Welfare to Work and Equal Opportunities (Mr. Andrew Smith)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Somewhere up north.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have always regarded Burnley as contested territory—it is where my good lady wife comes from.<br><br>
Why have not the Government tabled an appropriate amendment? Recent leaks in the press suggest that it is because there is open warfare between the Department of Social Security and the Treasury. That squabble must end. The Chancellor has many imperial ambitions and he wants to absorb the responsibilities of the Department of Social Security into the Treasury. I discussed this matter with a Labour Member last night, who said that there is a feeling that before the Chancellor has finished, all that is likely to be moving in Richmond house is the lifts. The Minister of State might reply, "If that is the Chancellor's view, he should sort out the matter."<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0733">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 477</span>
Why have the Government thrown the responsibility on to my shoulders? I shall use an analogy to explain why. I started my political career as a councillor in the Worth Valley ward of Bradford metropolitan district council. I remember, during a particularly close-fought election in the late 1970s, the problems that we experienced in that ward, which consists of a selection of villages and many committee rooms. I was in charge of a large committee room, but we had virtually no cars, although we had to knock up voters. In the same ward, there was a small committee room at Oxenhope, which was flush with cars but which had a small number of people to knock up. I remember going to visit the lady in charge of that committee room. She was a Tory lady of the old tradition—blue rinsed and extremely formidable. I said to her, "Can we have some of your cars to get the voters out?" She said, "You can't have any of our cars. Get out of your own mess. Why should we help you?"</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I was not there.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was quoting the lady's words. If you had been there, Mr. McWilliam, I should have noticed it and I should have been very surprised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. So would I.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Who knows what the future may bring. I said to her, "It is the same ward. If we get votes out here, we'll win. You can have all the cars you want, but if you don't get the votes out you won't win". "Don't bother me with that", she said. As I look across the Committee Room at the Minister of State—admittedly, in this light, his features are not clear—I think that I can see a blue rinse. I think that he is starting to adopt the attitude of that lady in Oxenhope—"Just because the Chancellor says so, why should we help them out". I believe that we should.<br><br>
Why would the Chancellor wish to compensate for the end of widow's allowance with a bereavement payment? His statements on the matter have been clear. He said, "They will be compensated". In fact, he said, "more than compensated". It is not within the powers of the Bill to introduce a new benefit to cover the period between the ages of 60 and 64. The only method available is the bereavement payment. The Chancellor has already recognised the problem in his decision to retain—rightly—the married couple's allowance for those aged 65 on 5 April 2000. Age Concern has told me that it has already received complaints from those who will be 65 on 6 April 2000. That will be a growing problem.<br><br>
The married couple's allowance is currently worth £500, but we cannot consider such matters in isolation. Any consideration of the total resources available to a bereaved person must take account of factors other than the bereavement payment. Bereaved people will face other burdens as a result of the Budget. Many of them, especially those aged between 60 and 64, will be peculiarly reliant on savings. Various schemes will be open to them. Because of changes in taxation, those who derive their income from savings will continue to pay tax at 20 per cent., while those who receive payments through occupational pensions will pay tax at 10 per cent. A number of bereaved people between the ages of 60 and 64 will face a hefty loss as a result of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 478</span>
withdrawal of mortgage interest relief at source. A number of schemes exist whereby elderly people who are asset rich but cash poor can remortgage. According to my reading of the Chancellor's proposals, those who are already taking advantage of such schemes will be protected, but those who do so in the future will not.<br><br>
During discussion of earlier amendments and clauses, my hon. Friends demonstrated the problems with annuities that arise from changes in the market and different interest rates. Who is to say that the current lull in such schemes will not recur, especially with regard to people aged between 60 and 64? The proposals, taken with the failure to deliver the bereavement payment to people aged between 60 and 64, work towards the extension of dependency. It is little wonder that Sally Greengross of Age Concern said that many pensioners would be better off if they had not saved.<br><br>
It is important for that age group to receive additional protection and, as it will affect mainly women, I shall refer to the plight of recently bereaved widows. The nature of society has changed since widow's bereavement benefits were introduced. The number of women in the work force who are actively engaged in full and part-time work has increased, but that is less true of older women. A woman who is bereaved in her early 60s is less able to turn to the other forms of income that are available to a woman who is bereaved at an earlier age.<br><br>
A bereaved aunt of mine said to me shortly after the funeral that her life had not ended, but was entering a new phase. I thought that that was a brave thing to say. Other bereaved people take years to get through the process. This simple additional £2,000 payment will help them in the process of bereavement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Committee is suspended.</span></p>
<p>10.27 am</p>
<p><i>Sitting suspended.</i></p>
<p>10.49 am</p>
<p><i>On resuming</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I apologise for the delay, which was caused by complaints about a draught from the open window. Anyone who now complains that the room is stuffy will not get another 15-minute suspension.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The break in our proceedings has equipped me with a party joke for years to come. When someone asks, "How many people does it take to fix a window in the House of Commons?", I shall be able to reply, "Three men, a ladder and a Committee to watch."<br><br>
I was referring to the problems faced by people in their 60s who are bereaved. I am indebted to Sylvia Chimicz, who is a member of the Coventry branch of the National Association of Widows and who, I believe, has written to every Committee member. She provided those of us who have no direct experience of bereavement with a good explanation of the associated problems. People between 60 and 64 face three in particular: loneliness and the lack of a partner with whom to discuss problems, unfamiliar tasks such as house repairs and car maintenance, and dealing with workmen and bills. Often, the husband is solely responsible for such tasks.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0734">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 479</span>
In dealing with a complicated provision that would amend other Acts, it would be easy to overlook the problems experienced by the bereaved when trying to resume a social life. Bereaved women, in particular, are often excluded from social functions, which tend to be the prerogative of couples. After the novelty of bereavement has worn off, they find themselves cut off and their sense of loneliness is doubled. For those reasons, we should look favourably on the amendment.<br><br>
Given the strength of the Chancellor's statement, which is entirely unambiguous, I find it amazing that no Government amendment has been tabled. His "Budget 99" press release states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Widows will be more than compensated for the loss of this allowance by the proposed Bereavement Payment in the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill."</p></blockquote>
The amendment would do nothing more and nothing less than meet the Chancellor's promise and I commend it to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Rendel <span class='memberconstituency'>(Newbury)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that we have reached the part of the Bill in which, as we promised, Liberal Democrats will take a rather greater interest. This clause, the clauses on the single gateway and further clauses on disability benefits are those that are most in need of amendment.<br><br>
I am delighted to support the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) and I should also like to discuss amendment No. 102, with which it is grouped. I was pleased to hear the hon. Gentleman refer to the Minister of State as having become more Tory than the Tories. Indeed, he mentioned the possibility of a blue rinse. Although the Minister may look nice with one, those of us on the Opposition Benches who have less hair would find it harder to achieve the blue-rinse effect. I am happy not to be seen with a blue rinse because my hair—I do not know how to describe it—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Follicly challenged.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rendel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. I am glad to see that many Conservative amendments to this and other clauses are in line with what I said on Second Reading. We will support some of their amendments and I hope that they will support some of ours. I was pleased to hear that at the end of Tuesday's sitting, which unfortunately I was unable to attend, my hon. Friend the Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten) found a couple of items on which he could support the Tories. That was a novelty for us.<br><br>
We welcome the fact that the Bill will extend to widowers payments that previously went only to widows, but that is not an excuse for failing to provide important benefits for the bereaved, which is why we tabled amendment No. 102. Bereavement costs are the same, whether you are of a pre-pension or post-pension age, or rich or poor.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am clearly of pre-pension age and I am certainly not rich.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rendel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. McWilliam, for reminding me that you are of pre-pension age. I am sure that that is accepted.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 480</span>
A number of people who are of post-pension age are not well off. The elderly, many of whom are on income support, are among the poorest in our society. Amendment No. 102 is aimed at them because they are unable to obtain help for the costs of bereavement, except through an appeal to the social fund where payments may be a great deal less than the proposed £2,000. If well-off people under the age of 60 are eligible to receive £2,000 towards the cost of bereavement, it is odd that people over 60—whether they are between 60 and 64, as stipulated in the Conservative amendment, or older—who are worse off, do not deserve at least as much help. The Government's original consultation paper said that help towards bereavement costs is too low. If help is too low for better-off people who are less than 60, surely help should be available at a higher rate for older people who are less well off, which is what the amendments propose.<br><br>
Furthermore, the Budget proposes to remove the widow's bereavement allowance, as the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar explained. He mentioned the now notorious quote from the press release, which I shall not give for a third time, and which the Government admitted was misleading. I tabled a parliamentary question the other day that asked how many people in different age groups the proposal would affect because we are not clear on that. The response did not contain much information. I was told that existing claimants would retain their entitlement to the allowance after 5 April 2000 and that widows who are bereaved after that date will not be able to claim it. That does not tell us how many would be affected, but the Government must know because they told <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> that 220,000 widows would lose the payment. Of those, 100,000 are already over 65 and will receive no help from the new bereavement payment, unless the Government adopt our amendment or the Conservative amendment, or unless we win a vote against the Government, which is always possible. The other 120,000 will receive no bereavement payment if their spouses die after the surviving spouse has reached pension age. The allowance was worth £285 this year and would be worth £197 next year, so it would have amounted to almost £500 in total.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
To make matters worse—I do not think that the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar mentioned this—the allowance will be abolished in 2000, but the new bereavement payment will not be paid until a year later, so there will be one year in which no one will receive the bereavement payment, which the Government claimed would replace the allowance that is to be abolished. Therefore, the 65-plus group of widows will be hit with a triple whammy. They will lose the bereavement allowance and they will not receive the new bereavement payment of £2,000. On top of that, those widows whose husbands made state earnings-related pension scheme payments during their working lives and whose husbands die after 5 April 2000, will also lose half their entitlement to additional pensions.<br><br>
For some reason, the Government seem to be hitting especially hard the more elderly age group, whose costs are just as great as those of younger people. The

Government seem to be prepared to spend more money on the bereavement payment—they have said that it should be raised and they are raising it to £2,000, which we accept and applaud—but it would seem more sensible if the extra money was spread more fairly between those who need it most. We suggest that those who need it most are the poorest, who are on income support or could be on income support had they chosen to claim it. That is where more money should be spent and that is the reason why we tabled amendment No. 102. I should like to put you on notice, Mr. McWilliam—if I can do such a thing without insulting you—that we should like to move the amendment formally once we have considered amendment No. 202.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I confess to making a mistake earlier. I said—rather loudly, so that it was heard by the whole Committee—that I thought that these wonderful tapestries were Flemish, 17th century. I still think that they are Flemish, but I think that they are probably 16th century, and even more precious than I originally thought. I do not know what has happened to one of them—perhaps we should ask the Serjeant at Arms—but it appears as if someone has taken a symmetrical bite out of it.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar said, this is a sad day for the welfare state because the new Labour Government have started to take savage blows at the welfare state, including benefits for widows contrary to their rhetoric and announced principles for many years, without any warning and without any reference being made to it in the manifesto. The concept of widows' benefit has been with us for nearly 75 years. It was first introduced in the Widows' Orphans' and Old Age Contributory Pensions Act 1925. That date is significant because the legislation was introduced not by the 1924 Labour Government, but by the 1925 Baldwin Government. Neville Chamberlain was the Minister who took the Bill through the House. I do not remember whether the Labour party opposed the legislation at the time, but I doubt whether they did.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gainsborough)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was part of Neville Chamberlain's great reform programme. Between 1924 and 1929, that Government had a first-rate record of extending welfare to many people who had not enjoyed it before. Neville Chamberlain, whose subsequent record was not very good, should at least be remembered for that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Chamberlain's record as a Minister for health and for labour and as Chancellor of the Exchequer was extremely good, but I share the judgment of my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh) on his record on foreign policy when Prime Minister. I am glad that my hon. Friend intervened because we are proud of that record. It is not a record of social legislation because that began with Disraeli and the Artisan's and Labourers' Dwellings Improvement Act 1875 and the Public Health Act 1875. What my hon. Friend said is evidence of a tradition in this country of which I thought all parties were allowed to be proud—the building up in the 20th century of the welfare state on the basis of the contributory principle. That was started by the Liberals before the first world war, inspired by the German
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 482</span>
experience, continued and strengthened by Conservative Administrations in the 1920s and further reinforced by the Beveridge report in 1943, to which unanimous support was given by all the parties in the coalition Government at that time.<br><br>
The Beveridge report was not fully implemented, particularly the funding elements, but its general principles were enshrined in legislation introduced by the Labour party in 1948. Now, at the end of the century, the Labour party is attacking the whole structure that was put together by generations with considerable effort, difficulty and dedication, but with the confidence that they were building an edifice from which future generations would benefit. All of us in the Room have benefited substantially from the welfare state. Who would have supposed that a Labour Government coming to power at the end of the century would begin to take the bricks out of that edifice? That is sad. The Government have a vast majority and think that they can do what they like, whether or not they have a manifesto commitment on the matter. At least we still have freedom of speech, so I can say that that is deplorable.<br><br>
The situation is not made better because it is disguised by deceptive and fallacious new Labour public relations. New Labour PR says that this is good news. It had the nerve and temerity to say that it is good news for widows. We may hear some Alastair Campbell speak from the Minister in a few minutes. He may say that the Government are modernising the welfare state, life has changed, they want to do more for people, they are extending benefits to widowers, the bereavement allowance is being increased from £1,000 to £2,000, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I sincerely hope that we do not hear any Alastair Campbell speak in the Committee. I shall not allow that sort of language.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The reality is that the gross cost of the measures to extend the bereavement allowance, which is being increased to £2,000, and the six months' bereavement benefit to widowers is £100 million in a full year. The saving to the Treasury of means-testing bereavement benefit is around £575 million. The Bill represents a decision by the Labour Government to take from widows £475 million in each and every full year, which is as near as makes no difference to half a billion pounds. That is not a welfare reform to deal with fraud and those who can work but do not want to, such as young, able-bodied layabouts. We agree that the Government should be robust with those people and that was part of the purpose of the jobseekers allowance when we introduced it, despite Labour opposition. We have supported the strengthening of discipline. We have supported compulsory interviews and withdrawing benefits from people who do not observe their obligations on jobseeker's allowance. We are happy with that.<br><br>
The Labour party has decided that widows are a soft target. They have gone for an even worse soft target, in the form of disabled people, but we shall discuss later. Mr. Alastair Campbell has decided to say, "To hell with 225,000 widows,"—I think that that is the figure that has just been quoted—"we don't need them. After all, they are only 1 per cent. of the voters in this country, so we can
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0736">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 483</span>
screw them and take £500 million from a limited number of vulnerable people." One cannot get away from that basic arithmetic.<br><br>
I want the Committee to think about the kind of person who will find her life changed for the worse as a result of the proposals. We all know such people in our constituencies. I can visualise one or two people falling into that category and I can visualise their homes. Let us take as an example a widow, whose husband has died from a disease or in an accident, and who has devoted her life to bringing up her children. She is house-proud, living in a modest home, probably in a council house or flat, where the brass is perfectly polished, the place is spick and span, and the children always get to school on time. She is a person with old-fashioned virtues who believes in devoting her life to her children and her family. Children inevitably benefit enormously from the privilege of such a background.<br><br>
A lady like that, who has devoted her life to her children, will lose her widow' s benefit when the children grow up and leave school or full-time education at either 16 or 19 years old. She might be in her 40s or 50s, and she will be told by the new Labour Government, "Right, you can go back to work. You can go and scrub floors." She does not have any qualifications. She will not be able to walk into the sort of nice yuppy job that many of us have had—I mean hon. Members on both sides of the Committee, I am not just attacking the Labour party there.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Kali Mountford <span class='memberconstituency'>(Colne Valley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am fascinated by this description of women who are unable to cope. The hon. Gentleman has obviously forgotten other policies that are in place to enable a person in such circumstances to gain qualifications. Will he tell us how he intends to pay for the recommendations that he has put to the Committee?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not making recommendations. The proposals are not mine—it is not my Bill. Moreover, the Conservative Government did pay for widow's benefit, as it was originally established in 1925 and as it continued, until after the Labour victory of 1997. That is the point that I am making. The hon. lady should ask her own Ministers why they are producing the proposals. They not my proposals and I reject them. This is a squalid way of raising £500 million for the Exchequeur. The hon. Lady intervened on me because she did not like my example, because it is near the bone. I am sure that she knows people exactly like that in her constituency.<br><br>
I have the greatest admiration for the successful career girl. It is one of the great aspects of the modern world that women do not feel inhibited to pursue any career that they wish to. That is why they now play such an enormous part in national economic life. That was not my point. I was putting to the Committee the case of someone who has chosen—or whom circumstances have led—to take what one might call a more traditional female role. I do not despise that. I admire enormously the dedication, selflessness and hard work involved in a woman's bringing up small children, often in difficult circumstances when she has been widowed. That should excite the admiration of us all.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 484</span>
I have just given an example of someone in that situation who, under these new Labour proposals is going to be told, "Right, back to work, you, as soon as your children have grown up. You are on the jobseeker's disciplines now." They will treat the lady whom I described like a young person aged 22 or 23, who drifts around street corners asking for means-tested benefits. I am entirely in favour of being tough on those young, able-bodied people. Welfare reform in that regard would be useful and we shall support any efforts that the new Labour Government make in that direction. However, we utterly reject this cowardly attack on the most vulnerable, whom Mr. Alastair Campbell calculated are not electorally significant.</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Hugh Bayley)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Shameful!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it is—utterly shameful. I hope that the hon. Gentleman conveys my remarks to Mr. Alastair Campbell. He needs to know what is said of him in the House.<br><br>
The Government's attack on the contributory principle, on which our welfare state was established, has been executed with great contempt. As if that were not enough, they have made two additional attacks on it. They said, in relation to people who receive bereavement benefit, that it will no longer be possible to take into account the SERPS contributions of the deceased party to the marriage. That is a further, extremely mean, vitiation of the contributory principle.<br><br>
Moreover, I believe that the Government's intention is that it should no longer be possible for people to apply for incapacity benefit on the basis of their deceased spouse's contribution record. That idea does not appear in the Bill and it was not announced in the Green Paper. If I were told that the new Labour Government are not going to proceed with the proposal, I should be delighted to withdraw my strictures. It was possible to apply for that benefit under previous Conservative—and under previous Labour—Governments but, apparently, that benefit is going to come to an end.<br><br>
In my example, I described a widow whose life was dedicated to her children—she gave up her youth and her energies to bring up her family. If she becomes disabled and is permanently unable to work, she will no longer qualify for incapacity benefit on the basis of her husband's national insurance contributions. She will be flung on to the market and told, "You have no other savings, so you will get means-tested benefits. If you have got savings, you jolly well live on them. Your foolish, dead husband was stupid enough to leave you his hard-won savings of £10,000." The new Labour Government will say, "Right, that means that you cannot have the means-tested benefits. You have got to consume your husband's savings."<br><br>
The Government's proposal is brutal and horrid. The Committee has been asked to consider a revolting suggestion—such terms need to be used in this context. The country must realise what it took on board when it voted for a new Labour Government, who used
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0737">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 485</span>
completely dishonest propaganda to hide what they were going to do when they came to power, namely, run down the welfare state, attack the contributory principle and try to screw sums of money from some of the most deserving people in our society, who can least afford to spare it. I utterly reject the Government's squalid proposal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howard Flight <span class='memberconstituency'>(Arundel and South Downs)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment and that which is grouped with it. The Chancellor has become over-confident and it is shameful that he should have boasted about the new, larger bereavement payment when those aged between 60 and 64 were omitted—whether deliberately or not—from it. I am sure that the Government will support the amendments. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar, I am surprised that they did not table similar amendments.<br><br>
I sympathise with the Minister of State for having to speak for the Government on this issue, as he is clearly a decent and honourable individual. As my hon. Friends pointed out, it is extraordinary that the Government should choose widows—especially elderly widows—as a group to persecute. Widow's pensions, in particular, were a straightforward national insurance principal benefit. If the Government had said before the election that, as part of their mandate, they would redefine widow's benefits in a new trendy way that would appeal to the voters—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rendel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman said that the Government were hitting elderly pensioners particularly hard. My amendment would provide some relief to the more elderly, as would that tabled by his hon. Friends, but bereavement allowance has never been given to the more elderly pensioners in the past. The Government are not imposing extra restrictions, they are simply not letting the allowance go to the more elderly pensioners in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I was supporting the Liberal Democrat amendment as well as that tabled by Conservative Members. Secondly, I was trying to point out that the Government are telling the population at large that they are doing something positive for widows. The larger bereavement payment is being presented as good news, while the abolition of the widow's pension is being obscured behind complex legislation. I was moving on to speak about the wider objective of the Bill—to abolish the widow's pension without a mandate and to do so in a devious fashion that prevents people from knowing what is happening.<br><br>
At a large meeting of my constituents recently, I asked whether they were aware of the fact that the widow's pension was being abolished. Not one person raised a hand. They had not understood the purpose of the legislation and, when I explained that it would abolish the widow' s pension as a national insurance contract, they were deeply shocked. That abolition is comparable with an insurance company redefining the benefits of a policy without any upfront agreement from the policyholders before doing so. That is a further example of the sort of con tricks in which the Chancellor is developing good form. It is the Committee's job to make the public aware of what is happening and to alleviate the impact as far as possible.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 486</span>
If the amendments were accepted, those elderly people who will be particularly hard hit—who have been malevolently excluded from the increased bereavement benefit or who do not qualify for it—would qualify for the increased bereavement benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief because the argument can be summed up simply. I understand the Government's position—I am trying to be fair to them and I have read part of "A new Contract for Welfare Support in Bereavement". I understand why, especially in the light of the involvement the European courts, the Government felt it right—as we all do—to end discrimination against men. I also understand why the Government felt that people should be given more help with the immediate costs of bereavement.<br><br>
Surely, however, we are dealing with a class of people who are in such a sensitive situation that, when we change the law, we should ensure—to put it simply—that no widow is worse off. All the Minister has to do to allay our fears is to assure us that no widow will be worse off, but I fear that he cannot do that. I can understand why he wants to help people who are on low incomes, but we are dealing with such a sensitive issue that it will be intolerable if the position of people who are facing such a crisis in their lives is made worse.<br><br>
I am grateful for the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies). The first principle is that no one should be worse off. The second is that if someone's husband has made contributions throughout his working life, imagining that they would help his widow, there should be an absolute principle that the widow receives the amount that was expected by her deceased husband. Is not that a simple matter of natural justice? We would consider it intolerable if a private insurance company sold a package and then redefined the amount to which the person was entitled years later. We know that Governments do that all the time.<br><br>
The third principle is that there are still many hundreds of thousands of women who have never worked. They are at a difficult age and should not be required to work if they are widowed. I need not repeat the arguments that were made movingly by my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford. If someone has been a home-maker all her life and involved in bringing up children, she may not have acquired qualifications in the world of work. When she is then faced with the appalling circumstances of the death of her husband, she is entitled to be allowed to stay at home. Those three principles are sacrosanct and I hope that the Minister will assure us that the Government think so too.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Kali Mountford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members have mentioned the situation in 1948 several times. When the Government examine the situation in 1999, and how to spend their resources, in considering legislation for the new millennium, it is incumbent on them to think about what the legislation is for and who in society should be supported. My remarks are based entirely on my own point of view. No Whip or Minister has asked me to say anything. I genuinely believe that when considering how to spend our resources, we must focus on the people who need the most. The Opposition imply that widows are so shocked that they are incapable—</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pickles</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful. The hon. Lady is extremely gracious.
