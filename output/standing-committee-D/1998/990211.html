Draft Railways (Rateable Values) (Scotland) Order 1999</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Calum Macdonald) </span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Railways (Rateable Values) (Scotland) Order 1999.</p></blockquote>
This is a straightforward draft order, which prescribes rateable values for the year 1998–99 for the operational lands and heritages that are occupied by ScotRail and other franchise operators who are in rateable occupation of property that was acquired from the British Railways Board.<br><br>
When the ScotRail passenger rail franchise was acquired by the National Express Group on 1 April 1997, the British Railways Board (Rateable Values) (Scotland) Order 1995, which prescribed the rateable value of property that was occupied by British Rail, ceased to have effect. A new order was therefore required to prescribe the rateable value for the new occupiers for 1997–98 and for each subsequent financial year until 1 April 2000.<br><br>
The rateable value figure that was prescribed in the 1997–98 order was taken from the British Railways (Rateable Values) (Scotland) Order 1995, but it was adjusted to take account of the disposal of several properties. For the 1998–99 draft order, the figure has been further adjusted to take into account the acquisition of new station leases. The rateable value has been apportioned among the franchise operators on the basis of rental evidence from the current regulatory and charging regime and between local authorities on the basis of the locations of the properties concerned.<br><br>
The draft order has been subject to consultation with local authorities and with the franchise operators concerned. All are in agreement with the proposal. A further order will be required for 1999–2000 in due course. I commend the order to the Committee.</span></p>
<p>10.2 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oliver Letwin <span class='memberconstituency'>(West Dorset)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I need not detain the Committee for more than a few seconds. The Minister assured us that the various parties concerned consented to the rates, so I do not see how we can object to them. I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
hope that the Minister has no more trouble from my colleagues on the Liberal Benches and that we will all be spared further consideration of a measure that is clearly sensible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Robert Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have just two minor queries because the Minister has already dealt with my other concern. The number of relevant persons has increased since the last year to include West Coast Traincare Ltd. Is that a new company which has come into being since the previous order, or was it left off the previous order by mistake?<br><br>
My other query relates to our previous debate on the order. The Minister said then that, in 2000, we would move to proper valuations of railway properties, which would be carried out in the same way as those of other commercial properties. Is 1999–2000 definitely the last time that rateable values will be set in the present way?</span></p>
<p>10.3 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask three questions. First, am I right to assume that the order will be a matter for the Holyrood Parliament rather than for the House of Commons the next time around?<br><br>
Secondly, I visited Railtrack at Cowlairs at the weekend. Does the order do anything to prevent the railway authorities from selling off disposable land—I do not want to overegg the pudding—dirt cheap, as they have in the past? From the point of view of the public purse, it is a matter of considerable sadness that so much extremely valuable land—particularly valuable inner-city land—has been sold off to developers at a tenth of the price at which it should have been.<br><br>
Thirdly, I understand that the Government's medium to long-term policy is that the formula rating should be phased out because it can lead to anomalies. How long will that process take? Will it be finished by 2001? What is the timetable?</span></p>
<p>10.5 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, West Coast Traincare Ltd. is a new subsidiary of Virgin, which is why it is included in the list this year.<br><br>
It is still the intention to change over to conventional valuation, but that will require a further order to be made next year. That will be the last act in the sequence. It will be a matter for the Scottish Parliament in Holyrood.<br><br>
The order does nothing to stop the sell-off of land. It simply records the impact of any sell-off or acquisition on the franchise operator's prescribed rateable value.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Railways (Rateable Values) (Scotland) Order 1999.</p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Committee rose at six minutes past Ten o 'clock.</i></p>
