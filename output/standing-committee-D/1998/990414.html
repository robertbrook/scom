Draft European Parliamentary Elections Regulations 1999</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. George Howarth)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft European Parliamentary Elections Regulations 1999.</p></blockquote>
It is a pleasure to be meeting under your wise chairmanship, Mr. Atkinson. Despite the occasionally difficult history of some of these matters, I am sure that you will keep us all in order.<br><br>
The Committee may recall that the European Parliamentary Elections Act 1999 received Royal Assent on 14 January. My eyes mist over at the thought of it. The Act provides that future elections to the European Parliament in Britain will be conducted using a regional list voting system. The Act, as I am sure we all recall, had a somewhat stormy passage through the other place. The Committee may be relieved to know that I have no intention of going over the same arguments about the voting system. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle) will be relieved to hear that.<br><br>
The draft regulations govern the way in which the election will be conducted. The key text in British electoral law is the Representation of the People Act 1983, which is a consolidation of several earlier pieces of legislation. That Act has a couple of hundred sections and several schedules, including one containing what are known as the election rules. The regulations and rules governing all other elections, such as local elections and European parliamentary elections, are based on adapting and applying the 1983 Act to suit the circumstances of the elections in question. Therefore, although the European Parliamentary Elections Act 1999 sets out the broad framework for future European parliamentary elections, the secondary legislation that we are debating this afternoon provides the subsidiary detail, applying and amending the 1983 Act as the new system requires.<br><br>
We have already consulted political parties, electoral administrators and interested bodies on the draft regulations. I am grateful to all those who took the time to comment, as that process has helped us to refine the draft and enabled us to lay the regulations before the Committee.<br><br>
I cannot in the time available take the Committee through every instance where the existing rules have been applied, disapplied or amended to take account of the new system. Instead, I shall highlight the main features and, in particular, explain the reasoning behind the changes that were commented on during the consultation process.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
In each region registered political parties will be able to put forward lists containing as many names as there are seats to be filled in that region, or fewer names if they wish. Independent candidates will be able to stand. Nominations will, not surprisingly, have to be accompanied by a signature from each candidate indicating their consent to the nomination. No signatures will be required from the electorate. Given the size of the regional electorates, we have decided to do away with the subscriber requirement, which did not demonstrate support among the electorate but placed an unwelcome burden on electoral administrators, who had to check that signatures were genuine. It would also have been onerous on political parties and any independent candidates.<br><br>
A nomination will also have to be accompanied by a deposit of £5,000, both for party lists, however many names they contain, and for independent candidates. The closing date for nominations is 13 May.<br><br>
Under the expenditure regime that we are proposing, an individual candidate or a party contesting a single region the maximum that can be spent on the campaign is £45,000 multiplied by the number of seats in the region. For example, in the north-east, which has four seats, the maximum is £180,000. I should point out that the regional limit is not affected by how many candidates a registered party chooses to place on its list. For a party contesting two or more regions, the maximum that it can spend will be the sum of the relevant regional limits. This means that a party contesting every region will be subject to a limit of £3.78 million, which is the total of all 11 regional limits.<br><br>
A party's expenditure limit is designed to cover all its election expenditure. The old distinction between constituency expenditure, which was subject to a limit, and national campaigning, which was unlimited, will no longer apply. As a result of the report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, all expenditure has to be accounted for and be subject to a limit. The national limit of £3.78 million is in line with the Neill Committee's recommendations, which I hope that the Committee will agree are appropriate.<br><br>
However, parties contesting more than one region are free to spend their money where they choose. They do not have to spend particular amounts within particular regions for two reasons. First, it is not appropriate for the Government to tell parties how they should run their campaigns. Some parties may want to campaign regionally while others may have a national strategy and surely it should be up to them to decide. Secondly, in a list based election where the emphasis is on encouraging the electorate to vote for parties rather than particular individuals, it would be very hard to distinguish between regional and national expenditure. I should add that the Neill Committee has also welcomed the regulations governing party expenditure.<br><br>
The regulations provide for the freepost arrangements to remain pretty much as they are now, except that in the case of parties it will be one entitlement to the freepost for the list as a whole rather than for each candidate on the list. Again, I hope that the Committee will agree that that is a sensible arrangement.<br><br>
We have decided not to apply section 93 of the Representation of the People Act for these elections. The committee will recall that that is the section that prevents
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0289">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
broadcasters from covering a particular electoral area unless they have the consent of all the candidates contesting that area. Clearly, when regions can have over 50 candidates, that would simply not be practicable. However, I hope that the Committee will be reassured to know that the broadcasters will still be bound by their general and statutory duty to provide fair and impartial coverage. I should also add that the question of party election broadcasts is one for the broadcasters rather than for the Government. Polling day will be 10 June and the polls will be open from 7 am to 10 pm.<br><br>
As in previous elections, counting cannot begin until the polls close in the last EU member state on the evening of Sunday 13 June. Counting will be conducted at Westminster parliamentary constituency level, although the regulations allow an acting returning officer who is responsible for more than one Westminster constituency to combine them for counting purposes. It has been suggested that returning officers should be required to produce individual results for each Westminster constituency. The Government's aim is for these—and indeed any—elections to be conducted in the most efficient and cost-effective way. We believe that the decision whether to combine constituencies should be for the local returning officers to make, since they are the people best placed to know what would be most efficient in the particular circumstances of their areas. We understand, however, that in most places, votes will be counted on an individual constituency basis.<br><br>
All the parties and individual independent candidates will have the right to be represented at all the local counts. They will also have the right to ask for a recount if they are unhappy with the way in which the count has been conducted. Once the local count has been completed to everyone's satisfaction the returning officer will transmit the result to the regional returning officer who will in turn give him or her clearance to declare it locally. When all the local results have been passed to the regional returning officer, he or she will perform the seat allocation calculation using the by now famous, and in some quarter infamous, d'Hondt divisor. I intend to keep my promise to my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart) and shall not enter into a discussion about Mr. d'Hondt, who is long dead, other than to say that the Bill that prompted the regulations is peppered with responses to d'Hondt and his system and the various ways of calculating the results.<br><br>
The political parties and independent candidates will be allowed to be present at the regional centre where the seat allocation calculation is to be performed and will be able to ask the regional returning officer to repeat the calculation if they suspect an arithmetical error. However, they will not be able to ask for a full regional recount. There are two good reasons for that. First, the regional result is nothing more than an amalgamation of local results. As I said, parties and individual candidates will be entitled to be present at all the local counts and to ask for recounts at that stage. If they signify that they are happy with the local results, there should be no need for a full regional recount when those local results are added together.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. A. J. Beith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Berwick-upon-Tweed)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: From experience of recounts in my early career, one does not ask for the bother and expense of a recount unless the result is close. The regional calculations could be close even if in each individual constituency there had been such a wide margin that no one had been prompted to claim a recount. However, the subsequent discovery n a recount that 20 votes had gone astray in a single constituency might invalidate the regional calculation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the right hon. Gentleman made that intervention because what I was about to say answers his question. Like the right hon. Gentleman in my experience—I have fought more elections than I care to remember; always successfully, I am glad to say, although had I lost, it would have been the end of my political career—those who represent candidates at a count will know, particularly at constituency rather than regional level, when something odd has occurred. I remember a ward-level local government election when a bundle of votes went astray and had we not asked for a recount, the result would have gone in the opposite direction. Although the closeness of the result prompted the request for a recount, we knew there was something wrong because of the knowledge that existed at that local level. People are better placed to know when something is wrong at a local than at a regional level. The right hon. Gentleman is right that calls for a recount are often prompted by the closeness of the results, but they are also underpinned by local knowledge. Local knowledge is a stronger basis for making a justified call for a recount than a knee-jerk reaction because one is not happy with the result. The hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) is on the edge of his seat.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oliver Letwin <span class='memberconstituency'>(West Dorset)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will know that that issue has been much debated in Committee in regard to the Scottish provisions; what the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) was saying evidently has application in both systems. Can the Minister assure us that when, as a result of the fear of a close or even arithmetically important difference at regional level, there is a call for a recount at a local level when the local result is not remotely close, returning officers will have been guided by his Department to allow the recount?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to that point before I complete my remarks. As the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin) has rightly said, similar recount arrangements for the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly have been put in place.<br><br>
An example of the ballot paper can be found on page 44 of the draft regulations. The design is based on the results of extensive research undertaken by the university of London constitution unit and Social and Community Planning Research. The design has been well received and attracted little comment during the consultation process.<br><br>
One or two people have since suggested that the arrow that accompanies the instruction to the voter to place his or her cross in one of the boxes, which are set out in a horizontal line, could be taken to indicate that the voter
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0290">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
must place his or her cross in the box nearest the arrow. We do not believe that that confusion will arise. One of the conclusions in the research was that using
<br><blockquote><p>"various kinds of arrows to direct attention to die boxes …received a positive response."</p></blockquote>
The research recommended that with a landscape format instructions should be located on the left-hand side of the page.<br><br>
Finally, I should like to say something about how vacancies will be filled. If the Member of the European Parliament whose death or resignation has caused a vacancy was originally elected on a party list, the vacancy will normally be filled by the next available person on that party's list. However, that person must produce a certificate from the party nominating officer to show that the party is still content to be represented by that person. That will guard against the possibility that a candidate on a list may have changed party between the original election and the time when the vacancy occurs.<br><br>
If the MEP whose death or resignation has caused the vacancy was originally elected as an independent, or if a party list has been exhausted, a by-election will be held. Those arrangements are identical to those that the House has approved for Scottish and Welsh elections. I hope that I have addressed some of the concerns.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richard Shepherd <span class='memberconstituency'>(Aldridge-Brownhills) </span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should be grateful if the Minister would answer the question asked by the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed. It is a genuine question and it should be addressed. What will happen if the aggregation of constituency counts produces a close result, which is challengeable, yet each individual constituency within the overall European constituency has a large majority, especially as local knowledge will not immediately identify in which constituency votes may have been miscounted?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to help the hon. Gentleman, but I think that in the end we shall disagree about that point. The local knowledge of those who represent parties or candidates at counts will be important. If something odd were going on in my constituency, which could not have been foreseen, it would be picked up. I am sure that that would also happen in Aldridge-Brownhills. A close regional result would be picked up, but one could not tell why the result was close or whether something odd had happened.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Shepherd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, if a majority wer 8,000 at parliamentary level, most people would not be fussed about a bundle of 50 votes going astray. However, local knowledge would not disinter the fact that here had been an error that could change the overall list. That is the point, and no amount of reference to this mystical local knowledge of counts—the Minsiter and I have attended many counts—is likely to reveal the nature of the error or where it lies</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When all the results have been aggregated regionally, it would be difficult to carry out a recount for all the constituencies involved; it would be an
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
enormous undertaking. I am not sure that people would know what they were looking for. They would just say that it was a very close result. As the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed stated, that would be the trigger.<br><br>
If something untoward or unusual had happened at constituency level that needed investigation, that would be more apparent. In a sense, the hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd) was right: it would be difficult to detect a bundle of 50 votes that had gone astray. However, if something had clearly taken place during the count that must have made the result look unusual, it would be apparent to people and that is as much reassurance as I can give the hon. Gentleman. We must accept that practical considerations are at work and a recount on a regional scale would be an enormous undertaking and one which was probably not required and would not have any justification.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Shepherd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are not responsible for this election system, but the essence of the Minister's remarks is that the system cannot be challenged and may return the wrong Member. That is not a satisfactory response. All we are asking for is a safeguard mechanism, whereby the aggrieved party or the party that challenges can call for a recount of the whole region.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If someone is unhappy—if it is a close election—the procedure provides for the calculations to be gone through again. I accept that that is a different procedure. Most people accept that the best place at which to conduct the counting of votes is at constituency level. In practice, however, it would be extremely difficult at that level—under the regulations, impossible—to go back to each constituency. Everyone would have to be kept waiting until the final calculation had taken place. People would be in a standby fallback position in each constituency waiting to see if, at regional level, someone had asked for a recount. That is not a practical arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I would not pursue this point if I did not know that the Minister is trying to give an honest account of such matters. I draw his attention to Pepper v. Hart, which is important. Under the system that the Minister is creating, the chance of legal challenge will be enormous. The chance of a legal challenge is almost foolproof.<br><br>
An election at regional level may be far from close, but arithmetically it may lead to a different result if there are only a few votes different between one outcome and another. In those circumstances, will the Minister give guidance to the returning officers in individual constituencies that they should allow recounts even when their particular results are in no sense close in order to avoid legal challenge subsequently at regional level?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the result of the local count has been accepted by the returning officer, there is no scope to order a recount at local level. Nor is there scope for the Home Office to provide the guidance requested by the hon. Member for West Dorset, because it would be contrary to the regulations. We have difficulty therefore in agreeing to the hon. Gentleman's request. We accept that with the new procedures for the Scottish, Welsh and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0291">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
European elections it will always be necessary to review what took place and assess how the system worked subsequent to those elections. It will be usual practice for that to be carried out.<br><br>
I do not envisage that such problems will occur, but if they do, obviously the post mortem process would take into consideration the procedures used. I accept that that should be so, because in this country we have no experience of the voting system. The procedures are new and; in my view, they are correct, although some people will disagree. They are appropriate for the bodies to which people will be elected.<br><br>
I hope that I have dealt with the anxieties of some hon. Members, if only by my final assurance. The regulations will enable the next and future elections to the European Parliament to be conducted using the proportional regional list system that this Parliament has already approved in the shape of the European Parliamentary Elections Act 1999. I commend them to the Committee.</span></p>
<p>4.55 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Clappison <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hertsmere)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome you to the Chair this afternoon, Mr. Atkinson. In some respects, I join the Minister in the spirit of his remarks about the nature of the new system, which is a much more complicated system than the current one.<br><br>
I do not want to take issue with the Minister about every point of detail that he has outlined this afternoon. He has outlined a great deal of subsidiary detail amending the Representation of the People Act 1983. He knows that we think that the new system is inferior to the current one, that it will disappoint electors and that the more they see of it, the more they will be disappointed. We understand that they will not hear a great deal about it in advance of the election. Nevertheless, we accept that the system is being implemented by the present Government.<br><br>
The Minister owes the Committee more of an explanation than he has given about recounts. I have listened carefully to the answers that the Minister has given my hon. Friends, who have, perfectly properly, questioned him. I accept that he has done his level best to explain the regulations to the Committee and to answer hon. Members' questions. However, he has not answered hon. Members' questions about recounts, and the Government will have to reconsider those points. Is the Minister saying that no provision will be made for a recount at regional level if all the officers are satisfied at local level? If so, that is a recipe for serious trouble in future.<br><br>
I heard what the Minister said about the possibility of a review on recounts after the first elections, and I understand that Ministers say such things when they are in a bit of a hole. Given the vast size of the constituencies, perhaps a close result in a European election will be a rare occurrence. It may be rarer than in parliamentary elections, which involve sufficiently large electorates. However, a close result in a European election is very conceivable—perhaps not in the next election, or even the election after that, but perhaps in the future. Serious problems will arise from the Government's attitude towards recounts. At each local level, there may be a big difference in the votes, but when they are added together
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
at regional level—without having to apply the atrocious seat allocation formulae—the result may be very close. Provision must be made for a recount in such circumstances.<br><br>
I cannot understand what is so different about European elections compared to our parliamentary elections. In European elections, boxes are opened in many different local places, and results are counted in a regional centre. In the elections with which we are familiar as Members of this Parliament, boxes from many different electoral areas are opened and the votes counted. People have better knowledge of some electoral areas than others. The results from different boxes in different electoral areas and parishes may be very different, but the final result could be very close. In that case, in the parliamentary constituency as a whole with 60,000 or 70,000 electors, there must be a recount.<br><br>
It is not good enough for the Government to leave matters as they are at European level. There may have to be provision for a recount. When the votes in all the local areas have been added up, there may be differences between them, but in the summation, the result could be close. The Minister owes us more of an explanation about the details, if he wants matters to be satisfactory.<br><br>
I do not propose to go through everything that the Minister discussed, save one important subject, which he mentioned last and that is by-elections. The Government are in the habit of leaving that subject until last when European elections are discussed. It is tucked away in part IV of the regulations, which make provision for filling seats when vacancies arise, as they inevitably do in any parliamentary system.<br><br>
When the European Parliamentary Elections Act 1999 was debated in Committee—that seems a long time ago, given the various stages that it went through here and in the other place—we said that by-elections were an honourable part of our political tradition and that there should be by-elections when vacancies arose in the European Parliament. The Government were determined that when a vacancy occurred, it should be filled by the next person on the list. We were told that, among other things, a by-election would upset the carefully proportional result that had been reached in the original European election. In his reply to the debate, the Minister said:
<br><blockquote><p>"A by-election for a single seat in a region would be won by the party with the greatest electoral strength there, irrespective of whether it had held the vacant seat."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 5 March 1998; Vol. 307, c. 1247.]</p></blockquote>
That was the Government's attitude then—some of us thought that that was the idea of parliamentary democracy. We live and learn things from the Government every day.<br><br>
To be fair to the Government, that much is in the Act. It is tucked away in a schedule, headed, "Minor and Consequential Amendments." I suppose that for this Government, elections would be a minor and consequential matter. Schedule 2 regulations provide for a by-election to be held in specified circumstances and require
<br><blockquote><p>"a seat last filled from a party's list of candidates to be filled, in specified circumstances, from such a list (without a by-election)."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0292">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
That was the position in March 1998 when we debated the issue in Committee. We had been led to believe that the regulations would eventually make provision for a by-election to be held in certain circumstances. In other circumstances, a seat last filled from the party's list of candidates would be filled, in specified circumstances, from such a list. We understood the broad position to be that, in certain circumstances, perhaps when there had been an independent candidate or the list had been exhausted, there would be a by-election. In other circumstances when there were still people on the list, the vacancy would be filled by the next person on that list.<br><br>
That is the broad position that we were led to expect from everything that the Government said during the passage of the 1999 Act, and nothing was said to the contrary during our Committee proceedings in March 1998.<br><br>
On 8 June, in a written parliamentary answer, the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Our intention is that where a vacancy arises from the death or resignation of an MEP who was a candidate on a party list, the vacancy will be filled by the next eligible and willing candidate on that list, provided that the party concerned is still content to be represented by that person."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 8 June 1998; Vol. 313, c. <i>436.</i>]</p></blockquote>
Now that we are in opposition, we are getting used to reading parliamentary written answers several times to search for the clue that will tell us what die answer is really about. If we read this one carefully, we shall see that the clue lies in the word "eligible".<br><br>
On first reading, we would probably think that that answer confirmed what we were told when the Bill was being considered by the Standing Committee—that the vacancy would be filled by the next person on the list. However, in a careful and astute reading of the answer attention would have been drawn to the word "eligible", which lays the foundations for the regulations.<br><br>
If a vacancy has arisen, paragraph 17(2) of part IV of the regulations states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The returning officer shall take such steps as appear to him to be reasonable to contact the first choice"—</p></blockquote>
first choice means the next person on the list—
<br><blockquote><p>"to ask whether he will—
<ol>
<li>state in writing that he is willing and able to be returned as an MEP, and</li>
<li>deliver a certificate signed by or on behalf of the nominating officer of the registered party which submitted the relevant list stating that he may be returned as that party's MEP."</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
If I am not mistaken, that paragraph takes matters a stage further than we were led to believe when we were considering the Bill in Committee. It confirms what is pointed to in the Minister's written answer—when a vacancy arises because of the death or resignation of a Member of the European Parliament, or for some other reason, it will be filled by the next person on the list but—this is the crucial development—only if that person has the approval of that party's authorities.<br><br>
It is apparently not enough that the person who is next on the list should still be a member of the same party as he was when the European election took place, when his
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
name first appeared on the list. He must also be approved, or certified, by the party's authorities—the nominating officer—when the vacancy arises.<br><br>
That is a new development and a refinement of a system that is already replete with opportunities for centalised party control and the manipulation of candidates. It denies the electorate the choice of their individual MEP, but presents them instead with a list. We all know about that, because the House has debated it at some length, but this is a new development: not only must the vacancy be filled by the next person on the list, but that person must be approved by the party's authorities.<br><br>
The Government must say a little more about that development, rather than mentioning it only at the end of speeches or tucking it away in paragraph 17 of pat IV of the regulations or a schedule entitled "Minor and Consequential Amendments". They must own up, and tell us what it is about. Why have they chosen that course? Will the Minsiter explain why it is not sufficient for the vacancy to be filled by the next person on the list?<br><br>
I abhor the system, but I take it at face value: why is it not sufficient that that person is simply a member of the same party as he was at the time of the European election? The candidates' names will all appear on the list and on the ballot papers, and the electorate will be able to see who they are and where they are on the list. Why is it not sufficient that that person should still be a member of the same party? Why must he be approved by the party's authorities? Will the Minsiter confirm what would happen under the present system? My region—the eastern region—has a list of eight candidates for the European Parliament. For the sake of argument, let us say that the Labour party has three MEPs elected—that may be pessimistic or optimistic—and that number three for whatever reason, leaves the European Parliament. Number four is still a member of the Labour party at the time that the vacancy arises but would have to be certified by the party authorities. If they are not prepared to certify him, the vacancy goes to number five and if he is not satisfactory, to number six. Why should number four not take his place? Why does the order that appears before the electorate on the ballot paper have to be overridden by the fears of the central party authorities?<br><br>
The Minister owes the Committee more explanation as to why that should be. Many people will think that it is simply a way of imposing the maximum amount of centralised party control on the system. Why is it not left so that the place goes to the next person the list who is a member of the party? Why does he have to have the approval of the central party authorities? The Minsiter will have to answer that question as well as others about recounts asked quite properly by my hon. Friends.<br><br>
We think that it would be much better to hold a by-election and let the electorate decide, regardless of how many of them choose to vote—we know that there are variations for European elections. A by-election is a good thing because it allows the electorate to have a fresh say over who they want to represent them. Above all else, it puts the matter in the hands of the electorate rather than in the hands of the party machine. As things stand, it appears that the maximum amount of power will be given to the party machine, without two hoots being given about the electorate.</span></p>

<p>5.11 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Beith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You and I will vote in the same European parliamentary constituency at the next election, Mr. Atkinson. We may cancel each other out or claim rival recounts, but we shall follow the result rather carefully.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) spoke on behalf of the official Opposition, and I shall say something favourable abut a point that he made in a moment.<br><br>
However, I am never impressed with the zeal to hold European by-elections that one hears from time to time from those on the Opposition Front Bench and which is usually not shared by the Conservative party's managers. I have often wondered why they still so cruelly impose on the hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) the task of representing Essex North and Suffolk South in the European Parliament at the same time as his being here. [<i>Interruption.</i>] It is, in fact, the hon. Member for Vale of York (Miss McIntosh) who has that double role, which would be extremely demanding for anyone to play. The usual gossip is that the party managers do not like European by-elections.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am looking forward to the kind remarks that the right hon. Gentleman has to make. I shall make a slight correction to what he said: I think that he is referring to my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of York, not to my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Beith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I corrected myself, thanks to the advice of the hon. Member for Cheadle (Mr. Day).<br><br>
There is no doubt that to represent two completely different places in two different Parliaments is a task that no party now thinks advisable. Although parties discourage dual mandates, they are usually content to let them run for a couple of years or more rather than have European by-elections, which are expensive and in which small portions of the electorate take part. In a system such as this, they would risk overturning the proportionality of the result, and that is the reason for the alternative process to which the Minister correctly referred.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hertsmere made a significant point about the wording of the regulations. I can see the purpose of the wording; it is to protect a party from being landed with representation by someone who may have not formally left it but has become a great embarrassment, having ceased to believe in its principles and having become dissociated from it. However, the wording as expressed seems to open up the possibility that a party could, for example, insist on having a by-election by vetoing all the candidates on the list, or, as is much more likely, deciding that a candidate far down the list is more to its liking than the one who appears in the appropriate place. That is undesirable, and I would be happier if the regulations suggested that the party had to give grounds for such a request. It could be made public so that we could put it on the spot and avoid a rare instance of abuse of this power.<br><br>
We welcome other aspects of the regulations. We are glad to see a national limit on party expenditure, following the Neill Committee report. There has also been a change
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
to take account of the Bowman case, which allows for what in the more normal legal sense are called third parties—not third political parties, but individuals or organisations—who wish to show support for a candidate. They allow more expenditure than the current nominal £5. That change had to be made.<br><br>
We have some qualms. I have received representations about the appearance of the ballot paper and the placing of the arrow next to the Conservative box. Perhaps it would be better if there were a bigger space between the arrow and the boxes. I rely on the fact that, in general, the Government have sought advice and have tested the ballot paper in appropriate ways. I hope that the risk of people being confused is small.<br><br>
As I said earlier, my principal concern is about recounts, because they are almost bound to get us into difficulties. If parties are worried and, from looking at past election figures, have reason to believe that their ability to win one seat, or perhaps the second or third seat, is endangered by the likelihood of a close result at regional level, there will be great pressure to have recounts at local level to ensure that there are no missing bundles of votes. The question that the hon. Member for West Dorset put to the Minister earlier, which I think the Minister did not fully understand, was whether guidance would be given to returning officers not to call recounts after the result had been declared but to allow recounts in circumstances in which they would normally be discouraged under the present system. If I had gone to the returning officer after the last election in the Berwick constituency and asked for a recount, he would have said, "Don't be ridiculous. You have won by many thousand votes. It is a comfortable margin. You don't need a recount, nor do the other parties." However, in 1973 the Conservative party understandably asked for a recount twice because my majority was 57, and the returning officer naturally acceded to the request.<br><br>
Returning officers do not like recounts. They keep the staff there for a long time, they are expensive and tiring, and there is no guarantee that the result will be more accurate, because the staff become tired. Therefore, there is pressure not to have one if it can be avoided. In the new circumstances there will be much more pressure for recounts and it will be more reasonable for parties to anticipate difficulty by asking for a precautionary recount in the light of the regional situation. In its discussions with returning officers, the Home Office must accept, and lead them to accept that, if a party has good reason to believe that the result at regional level could be close—not just for the leading and second party but for any other party that thinks it might have enough votes to gain one seat—a recount is a reasonable request.<br><br>
Should there have been in the regulations, a provision for a regional recount? Clearly such a provision would need to be exercised more selectively and rarely, because it is an expensive business. I do not believe that it would be necessary to keep staff on standby until the full result was declared. Indeed, it might be a bad way of doing it. It is often better to start counting afresh the next day rather than recount through the night and continuously through the following day. However, it would be possible to reopen the boxes and have a subsequent count if the situation at regional level was close enough to justify it.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0294">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
As that has not been done, one consequence might be further court actions. The courts have demonstrated, as they did in the Winchester case, that it is possible to reopen an election result—literally reopen the boxes—and look at what might have gone wrong when the vote is close. It rarely benefits the party that does it, as was clear in the Winchester case, when the apparently tiny majority in the by-election became a majority of 22,000; It did not benefit my party in the 1920s, when it unseated a member—on an expenses matter—and then lost the subsequent by-election. Nevertheless that might happen from time to time.<br><br>
The fact that the courts can engage in such a process illustrates that it would be possible to devise a system which, though not quite a traditional recount, would mean going back to the boxes and doing the recount in limited circumstances. That is preferable to encouraging an aggrieved party to go to the courts in order to gain a handful of votes that might be necessary to carry it over a threshold. That problem has not been satisfactorily resolved for the future by the current provisions and there may well be difficulties ahead. However, that is no reason for not proceeding with the regulations and we shall support them.</span></p>
<p>5.20 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to raise only two points, one on recounts and the other on regulation 17.<br><br>
I should like to add to what the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed and my hon. Friends said about recounts. The construction of the new elections makes the circumstances that we fear more rather than less likely to occur. Narrow arithmetical differences, when channelled through the complexities of divisors, can have large implications. The Minister should follow the helpful route suggested by the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed and tell us that he has, taken sufficient advice between my original remarks and now to tell us that he will guide returning officers towards recounts at local level. If not, and no recounts are allowed when there is no close result at local level; and if at regional level—it could happen in every region of Britain in the forthcoming European election—there is an arguable effect of just a few votes on the numbers elected on each party list; and if, under those circumstances as I prophesy, all the regions are contested, I bring it to the Minister's attention—no one will be able to say that we did not say it in advance—that he and his Government will have egg all over their faces quite unnecessarily.<br><br>
The entire mechanism of proportional representation will be thrown into disrepute solely for the sake of avoiding properly advising returning officers what to do when a party asks for a recount under circumstances in which it would not normally be allowed. It might appear that an unfairness has occurred as a result of the regulations and of the Minister's and his Department's obduracy on the matter. The public will not take the view that they normally do—quite rightly, as the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed said—when elections are challenged. They will say that if an election has had
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
such an absurd result, it is perfectly proper to challenge it. They will also turn against the whole system of proportional representation.<br><br>
My hon. Friends and I would not regret that result. We would be perfectly happy to see this dreadful system thrown into yet more disrepute by results which could have been seen to be fair but were not because of a mishap in the application of the regulations. The Minister should realise that we are arguing not a party-political point but one that relates to the rationality and logic of his proposals. I hope that he will now provide us with the right answer on that question.<br><br>
On regulation 17, my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere has exposed almost all the arguments that needed to be exposed. Only one point and an apology need to be added. The apology is that we may not have noticed that the same problem applies to Scotland. We noticed it in connection with recounts, but the same problem is likely to arise in Scotland and Wales. We need to go back and check that. If it does apply there, we and other Opposition Members may have been negligent in failing to notice it earlier.<br><br>
In one respect, however, the situation is worse than my hon. Friend for Hertsmere so eloquently described. The logic of regulation 17(2) is the logic of party. If it is necessary under the regulations for the party to authorise a particular candidate on the list to be the replacement for number one, two, three or four, the only logic to justify that is that which decrees that electors have in effect elected a party, so the names that they have elected are virtually an irrelevance—it is up to the party to decide which name ought to replace that of the person who happened, under the party's aegis, to be elected in the first place. Although Conservative Members do not accept that that is a good way to conduct elections it is perfectly coherent logic.<br><br>
The logic of regulation 18 is wholly different. It is the logic of names on a list, or individuals. It tells us that if we get to the point of 17(8), where the list has been exhausted, there is to be a by-election, rather than another person being nominated by the same party without a by-election. How on earth can those two logics occur in the same set of regulations?<br><br>
It the party is what counts, not the names on the list, and if the party has the right to eliminate all the other names on the list in order to cause a by-election, how can it also be the case that if the list is exhausted, rather than looking to the party to produce another person as a replacement, in order to avoid the disruption of proportionality—which the Minister alleged was the reason for the whole thing in the first place—there should suddenly be a by-election and a return to first past the post? That is simply incoherent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Beith</span><span class='membercontribution'>:The hon. Gentleman is making a debating point, because he would surely not want to advocate regulations in which the party could substitute someone whose name had not appeared on a list that had gained the electorate's approval.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0295">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. If my hon. Friends and I had our way, there would be a by-election and the logic of regulation 18 would prevail. But one cannot have both procedures in one set of regulations without the regulations appearing incoherent to anyone who is rational.<br><br>
I do not believe that the Minister and the people who have worked with him to produce the regulations have thought through the logic of them. Somewhere along the line, it must have been decided that it would be -a jolly good idea for the party to be able to exert a little more control—I cannot otherwise understand how this provision crept in. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere that the Minister needs to give an explanation. In particular, he must explain why that incoherence exists, if not because the first logic has been amplified simply to make the party's control greater.</span></p>
<p>5.27 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I shall begin with a few remarks on recounts. I explained in my opening speech why the regulations do not provide for the possibility of full regional recounts, but perhaps it would be helpful if I gave a little more detail.<br><br>
One important point which has not so far been made is that the regions being used for these elections are vast. There is little or no possibility of being able to count all the votes cast in one region in a single location. The logistics would be too difficult. It is not that we have not considered the issue—far from it. Much thought has been given to it. In practical terms, in most regions it is impossible to think of a venue that would be suitable to handle the number of votes involved. It would not make any sense to transport all the votes from, for example, across Scotland to a single venue. Not only would that be an expensive operation—although cost should never put a limit on democracy—but, more importantly, the procedure would be fraught with logistical difficulties.<br><br>
It might be worthwhile, if a little repetitive, to go over exactly what is proposed. A recount may be requested prior to the declaration of the result at constituency level. The local returning officer may refuse the request only if in his opinion it is unreasonable. I assume that it was at that point that the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed expressed concern about what might happen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will let me finish my point, I shall give way to him.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman suggested that we issue guidance. With regard to Home Office officials, some training has been done, but I am not sure whether it is still going on. If it is, I shall make sure that those concerns and issues are discussed at that level between now and the elections and incorporated into any training still to be completed. Given the way that the measure is structured, I do not think that it is possible for us to issue guidance that has a firm smack to it and says, "This is what you will do". It will have to be sorted out in discussions and during training. We are certainly not trying to prevent the correct result from being declared at local level and then being aggregated in the proper way at regional level.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>:I hope that the Minister understands that of course we accept that he is not trying to get the wrong result; ultimately, he is a democrat. He is close to saying something extremely helpful, and I should be grateful if he could go one step further. He said that it would be lawful for the returning officer to reject an application for a recount only if it was unreasonable. Would the hon. Gentleman be willing to undertake to explain to returning officers that the definition of reasonableness for these purposes includes a request for a recount under circumstances of the kind that the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed sketched out? I refer to circumstances in which the party, although recognising that the particular constituency result was not close, had reason to believe that the arithmetic of the final decision at regional level might be affected by a very few votes' difference at constituency level?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I am in a position to give the hon. Gentleman that assurance. However, I shall reflect on his points and see what is possible. I give that undertaking in good faith, as the hon. Gentleman did in making those suggestions.<br><br>
We come now to the question of by-elections. The written answer to which the hon. Member for Hertsmere referred said that vacancies would be filled by the candidate whose party is still content for him to represent it. I assure the hon. Gentleman that it was not my intention to slip into that written answer a new concept that no one had heard of before. It has been clear throughout that we are not dealing with eligibility. Those who have defected from a party between the list's publication and the election should not be allowed to fill those vacancies. That is still the intention.<br><br>
I am loath to get dragged into discussing legal matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman in a moment. If that power was used by any political party in an unreasonable way, that would be subject to legal powers. The intention all along has been to protect political parties and their lists from anyone who has in the mean time defected then being able to take up his seat on the basis that his name is on the original list. That is the intention behind it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept what the Minister says, but does he accept that the regulations go much further than protecting against the position of someone who defects from a political party? The regulations require someone to deliver a certificate signed by or on behalf of the nominating officer saying that they can be returned as that party's MEP. Such a provision would also cover someone who was still a member of the party, but of whom the party's central authorities disapproved. It might even cover circumstances in which the central authorities wanted someone else lower down the list to become the MEP, not the person higher up. Does the Minister accept that the regulations go much further than just the case that he outlined?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for West Dorset put his finger on the difference between what we are dealing with and ordinary parliamentary elections. The hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V007P0I0296">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
Member for Hertsmere and his colleagues have made it clear that they do not like this system as a matter of principle. This system is, however, totally different from the way in which we elect Westminster Members of Parliament. In a Westminster parliamentary election, the candidate and his or her party label are crucial. In the current context, I would defend mat system. It works well, although we may have a debate in the future about whether it should be superseded by another system. We are talking about a regional list system. The hon. Member for Hertsmere may not like that system, but the crucial thing about it is that it is based exclusively on parties and on a party list. It is not that the candidates are superfluous—clearly, they are not because they will become Members of the European Parliament. What it boils down to is that their rank on the list represents the position in which their party feels that they should be put.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take that as given, as I said. I disagree with the system, but I take everything that has been said about it in the past as given. Why, however, are the Government introducing a regulation that requires the next person on the list when a vacancy arises not only still to be a member of the same party but to get the approval of the registered party's nominating officer to show that he is an approved person? Why have the Government take matters that stage further?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For the simple reason that we are talking about a party-approved list system, as the hon. Member for West Dorset correctly noted. If one accepts that, who, other than the relevant party, will be in a position to say that the original list is still intact and appropriate? It must be the property of that party, which must be able to say that X, Y or Z is the next suitable person on the list because of defections or because someone is no longer even a member of the party. That is the logic behind the provision. If, under a regional party list system, one accepts that there should be scope to deal with people who have defected, the party is the logical body to do that—whether it be the Conservative party, the Liberal Democrats, or, indeed, my party. As I said earlier, if that power were exercised unreasonably in any case, the party's decision would be open to legal challenge.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Beith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is in danger of exaggerating the differences between the mechanics of the existing system and those of the system before us. The concept of an authorised officer, who certifies a candidature, is a consequence of the registration of parties legislation. It applies to candidates under the Westminster system and, indeed, in the current local elections. The concept is not quite as foreign to our system as the Minister implies.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will take on board the fact that there is anxiety about the wording being somewhat broad. There is a danger that a party might unscrupulously use it not simply to ensure that a person would still be on me list if it were created today, but to make a quite different decision from the one that it originally made and to introduce a different order from that which it presented to the electorate.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Shepherd</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It might be for the benefit of procedure if I say at least a word before I give way to the hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills.<br><br>
I concede that the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed is right. The position of the certifying officer on behalf of a party resulted from the legislation that he described—that is where the title comes from. To some extent, the present procedure is part of the process in that legislation for the registration of political parties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Shepherd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am genuinely confused as to the Government's intent in the regulations. I hate statutory instruments because although they enable us to make law, the House of Commons nay not understand where the primary legislation that it makes will lead. List, list, list; party choice, party choice, party choice—yet if I were to stand on the regional list and defect, or if the first six or seven who are elected all defected, that would be perfectly acceptable. There is no regulation or rule that can change the situation whereby people can simply change their party allegiance. When there is a genuine vacancy, however, the party insists on choosing and does not allow the electorate any choice.<br><br>
I do not understand the consistency in that, nor the point of what the Government are doing. I can defect—that is perfectly acceptable and does not require the party to intervene, although the party would understandably be outraged, while so much is being made of the list. The central truth is that people's judgment is allowed to be exercised in one set of circumstances and not in another set of circumstances—that is, when vacancies arise. That is inconsistent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a crucial difference between the situation that the hon. Gentleman describes and circumstances in which a vacancy occurs. The crucial difference is that the people who are elected from the list become MEPs, and it then becomes an issue of honour on their part as to whether they fulfil the mandate that was given to them by the electorate in electing that list. That is distinct from somebody who failed to be elected from a list and then, having no responsibilities as an MEP, changes their political allegiance in some way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not the point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: it is a fair point. There is a clear difference between someone who has been elected as part of a list and someone who failed to be elected, although they were part of a list when they stood.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman, but we must make progress.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clappison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that, and I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. He is not addressing me point that has been raised. Defections could have been catered for in other ways. The point is about continuing party

approval even though the person concerned, the person who is next on the list—[<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Poplar and Canning Town (Mr. Fitzpatrick) may laugh—perhaps he will curry some favour. The person who is next on the list could still belong to the same party but might not have the approval of that party's authorities so that they could be selected as the next person on the list. If the party wanted to be completely perverse—as the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed said—they could go right down the list and choose the person who is number seven or eight, who the electorate would have had no expectation of being chosen.<br><br>
The Minister made a point about the law. He seems to want to leave the matter in the hands of the courts and take the view that parties cannot behave unreasonably. The Government's intentions in the regulations are perfectly plain—to put the matter in the hands of the party authorities. The hon. Member for Poplar and Canning Town is nodding his head—he is obviously an enthusiast for party control. Many members of the public would think that the regulations are a recipe for central party control and, indeed, the regulations clearly spell that out. Why are the Government choosing this course and not simply confining the measure to ensuring that it is the next person who is a member of the party who is returned on the list?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We disagree on the essential principles. We are dealing with a regional party list system, and the hon. Gentleman does not like that. If he accepted, as does the hon. Member for West Dorset in his more lucid moments, that the logic of the system is that it is a party system, he would have to accept that given those circumstances party is a significant factor. Any centralising tendency, as the hon. Member for Hertsmere describes it, is a matter of practicalities. Somebody could stand for election as part of a list as a member of a party, not be elected, and then change party subsequently. That can happen, and there should be a way of taking account of it. That is the phenomenon with which the regulations are trying to deal.<br><br>
The hon. Member for West Dorset referred to regulation 18. In some respects, his arguments go another step further. He was saying, "Why have any names anyway; why not start from the beginning? If it is all about party, what have names got to do with it?" That was the underlying logic of the hon. Gentleman's comments. That goes further than we would want. There is legitimacy to someone whose name is on the list at the time of an election.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stephen Day <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cheadle)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is what my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With a party list, there is legitimacy to the names on it at the time of an election. However, events might mean that the situation had changed by the time of a subsequent by-election. The pressure on someone who was a list candidate but who failed to get elected is not the same as the pressure on someone who was elected. Someone who is elected is subjected to the responsibilities of representing a party in the European Parliament. We are trying to give recognition to the crucial differences between those two types of people. I shall give way to the hon. Member for West Dorset for the final time.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Hetsmere that the Minsiter has been typically gracious in giving way. He said something terribly important.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jim Fitzpatrick (Popular and Canning Town)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He always does.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Letwin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course, and on this occasion what the Minister has said is no less important than what he has said on any other. He stated that there was legitimacy to a name on a list. If there was legitimacy to a name, how could it be that it would be illegitimate to select again a person who was not elected on the first occasion, remained a member of a party, but fell out of favour with the leadership?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman runs the risk with that argument of drawing me into the internal splits in the Conservative party. To be honest, these concerns do not greatly exercise my hon. Friends and I because we do not anticipate such difficulties in the Labour party. The hon. Gentleman has greater concerns about the likelihood of people remaining loyal to the Conservatives. As I have said repeatedly, the crucial point is that the election plans provide for regional party lists. Once the logic of that has been accepted, the involvement of the parties in any subsequent by-election can be seen to be important.<br><br>
I envisage that the regulations would operate if someone who failed to be elected from a list changed their party allegiance. I think that we all accept that those circumstances should be allowed for.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Several hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Howarth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not give way again because we shall only go over the same gorund. Once it has been accepted that that concern is legitimate, such regulations can be seen to be necessary. For reasons largely to do with Opposition's fundamental disagreement with that system of elections, I suspect that I have not been able to persuade Opposition Members of the perfect logic of the regulations. They are the best that can be applied in such elections and I hope that the Committee will endorse them.</span></p>
