<section>
<div class='page-header'><h1>Social Security Contributions (Transfer of Functions, etc.) Bill [Lords]</h1></div>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Social Security (Mr. Stephen Timms)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move.
<br><blockquote><p>That, during proceedings on the Social Security Contributions (Transfer of Functions, etc.) Bill [<i>Lords</i>], the Committee do meet on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock and on Thursdays at Nine o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock, except for Thursday 18th February, when the Committee will meet at half-past Ten o'clock and at half-past Four o'clock.</p></blockquote>
First, I welcome all hon Members to the Committee. In particular, may I welcome you, Mr. McWilliam, to the Chair? In the past, you and I have discussed a variety of matters, although not, as far as I can recall, social security. I am delighted that you are in charge because you will guide our deliberations with a firm and fair hand, as ever.<br><br>
I also welcome the hon. Members for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies) and for Newbury (Mr. Rendel), who will speak on behalf of the Opposition parties. We will shortly be joined by the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, West (Ms Hewitt), who will share the burden of ministerial contributions to the Committee. At the moment, she is speaking at a conference in the City.<br><br>
I am pleased to say that the hon. Member for Newbury supproted the Bill on Second Reading, although the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford did not. It will be interesting to discover Conservative Members' position on the matter this morning, given the confusion that appears to surround it. It became clear on Second Reading that the shadow Chancellor, in the excellent Deregulation Task Force report, strongly supported the Bill's thrust. I commend that splendid document, into which we may well dip during our deliberations, to those Conservative Members who have yet to read it.<br><br>
Primarily, the Bill will combine the collection of all national insurance contributions with that of income tax. At the moment, 94 per cent. of national insurance contributions are collected by the Inland Revenue, along with PAYE or schedule D tax. It is therefore sensible to combine the organisations as well.<br><br>
Secondly, the Bill will enable the newly integrated organisation to improve customer service to employers, employees, self-employed contributors and others. For the first time, customers will be able to sort out all tax and national insurance affairs through a single organisation.<br><br>
Thirdly, the Bill will bring together the decision-making and appeals functions for tax and national insurance contributions within a single organisation That is a sensible provision, given that many
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
issues, such as employment status, are common to both functions. New appeals on contributions matters, which the Government introduced in the Social Security Act 1998, will therefore be heard by the tax appeal commissioners.<br><br>
I was intrigued to notice that the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford signed up to a report by the tax law review committee that was published last February, which calls for the merger of the national insurance contributions disputes procedure with the tax appeals system. That report, which I have studied carefully, is another splendid document. As far as I can see, it contains no minority report or dissenting note. Of course, the bill will bring about the very measures that the committee, including the hon. Gentleman, sought. I hope that he will reflect that point in this comments this morning.<br><br>
Fourthly, in the long term, we will gradually align the rules governing tax and national insurance contributions to simplify the system and reduce employers' costs. We will also streamline enforcement methods and thereby deal with non-compliant employers and contributors in a more efficient and cost-effective manner.<br><br>
Fifthly, the powers of inspectors to check national insurance records are being transferred with Contributions Agency officers. The powers have been in existence since the national insurance scheme was established in 1948 and have not been a problem for employers in 50 years. The main change is that we are decriminalising the offence of delaying or obstructing an inspector and aligning it with the tax civil penalty system, but we are not extending the powers from national insurance contributions to cover tax.<br><br>
Sixthly, concerns have been expressed elsewhere that the Bill could result in an ever-increasing exchange of information on the affairs of contributors and taxpayers between my Department and the Inland Revenue. I can reassure the Committee on that. The Bill protects flows of information that are necessary to maintain services, but goes no further on information sharing. The Benefits Agency must have the information on contributions that it needs to pay out benefits out benefits punctually and accurately. That flow is properly protected. The fight against fraud needs to continue. We are committed to that. Measures to allow disclosure of information for that purpose are in place and will continue through explicit statutory gateways.<br><br>
I am delighted that we have been joined by my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, who will share the ministerial burden in the Committee. I look forward to informative and illuminating discussions. I hope that all Committee members will feel assured that our deliberations have been for the benefit of those who contribute to and depend on the national insurance system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies <span class='memberconstituency'>(Grantham and Stamford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I echo the Minister's remarks? It is a pleasure to be debating under your chairmanship, Mr. McWilliam, which is vigilant, forceful and fair. I have had the pleasure of serving under your chairmanship on several occasions, although I have not served on a social security Standing Committee before. I remember you presiding in a distinguished way over a Finance Bill Committee, which often deliberated for a long time, and a European Standing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0287">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
Committee, which was a source of considerable passion, especially on the Conservative Benches, in the previous Parliament.<br><br>
I congratulate the Minister. Although there are not many things to admire the Labour party for, we must admire and envy the extraordinary information storage and retrieval system that it has assembled. I wish it was a good at running the national insurance records computer as it is at running its own computer, which allows party headquarters to keep efficient tabs on everything that we say. I realise that any obiter dictum that I may have uttered since the age of seven is probably recorded somewhere on its machine. It is Kafkaesque, but we cannot object; we live in a democracy and it is important that what is said in public life is a matter of public record.<br><br>
Two points need to be made about the two quotations given by the Minister. He had great fun on Second Reading with the quotation of my right hon. Friend the shadow Chancellor. I have had no reason to discuss the matter with my right hon. Friend, but I remind the Minister that the report was compiled when my right hon. Friend was not a Member of this House. He had no representative or public responsibilities. He was a director of a distinguished investment bank and was made a member of the committee set up by my right hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major), the previous Prime Minister, to represent the interests of the City and business. The committee included other business men and representatives of industry, commerce and the City and it was the responsibility of my right hon. Friend the Shadow Chancellor to examine the matter from the narrow business point of view. That is what the Government of the day expected him to do, because they took account of different opinions from many different sources and it was important for them to know what business thought about the matter. It would have been wrong for anyone in that position not to reflect the interests of his and similar firms.<br><br>
There is a responsibility on hon. Members—we have a representative function and a fiduciary responsibility to the electorate—to listen to all the interests that are represented in the country and to take account of all representations and lobbying to decide what is ultimately in the net public interest.<br><br>
The matter could be considered as a purely administrative reform. The Inland Revenue collects most national insurance contributions and we already have 90 per cent. of the effect of economy of scale for businesses dealing with one particular agency rather than two. The Government whom I supported introduced that measure. There could be scope for going further down that road so that the remaining 10 per cent. of the benefits of a potential merger of the two Departments would be achieved. If we considered the matter from that point of view, we might come to the conclusion being promoted by the Minister. There may be such a case to be made, but it is impossible to take the new Labour Government seriously when they make such a case. That is what is so insidious about the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the former Deputy Prime Minister appointed the Shadow Chancellor to chair the Deregulation Task Force, he did not appoint him to that position to pursue his narrow business interest in the way suggested by the hon. Gentleman. He said that he had not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
had the opportunity to discuss with the shadow Chancellor his view on the subject. On Second Reading, the shadow Secretary of State for Social Security told my right hon. Friend that there was no confusion about the shadow Chancellor's view. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"My right hon. Friend the shadow Chancellor will demonstrate that when he votes tonight."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 8 February 1999; Vol. 325, c.38.]</p></blockquote>
According to <i>Hansard,</i> the shadow Chancellor did not vote, so his views are crystal clear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that hon. Members are not always able to be present to vote. I assure him that whatever the Government's position, the Opposition's position is seamless. I agree entirely with everything that my right hon. Friend the shadow Chancellor says on economic and fiscal policy and I know that he agrees entirely with everything that my hon. Friend the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith), the shadow Secretary of State for Social Security, says on social and welfare policy. There is no doubt about that. The shadow Cabinet considers all such matters very carefully before a common position is announced and I hope that the Cabinet works in a similar way. My hon. Friend stated our common position very lucidly on Second Reading and the shadow Chancellor accepts that.<br><br>
I was also in business before coming to the House and had the Government of the day called me—they never did—for advice on a policy matter, I would have assumed that they wanted to hear my views as a merchant banker in the City. I would have said that they should be doing x, y or z in the interests of the City and of keeping the eurobond market here, ensuring that we get a greater share of the derivatives market or international securities business and so on. By saying that, I would have discharged a double duty: a duty of frankness to the Government of the day, and a duty of representing the interests of my shareholders and the market of which I was part. There is nothing dubious about taking that line. It would have been odd if, in that situation, I had tried to second guess what the public interest was, as if I were already a Member of Parliament or of the Government. I hope that we do not have to dwell on this matter for too long, and that I have not damaged the Minister's favourite toy—<i>[Interruption.]</i> He keeps fingering the report and it looks as if he is about to intervene again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Sedentary interventions, especially from Ministers, are to be deplored. Also, I read the Bill assiduously over the weekend, and references in it to the City of London are non-existent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With your usual fairness, Mr. McWilliam, you acknowledged that it was not I who raised the subject. It would have been wrong not to have responded, since it might have appeared that, by my silence, I endorsed the statements that had been made.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
To return to the main theme before the Committee, the Opposition believe that the Bill is insidious—insidious in the original Latin sense of the term, because, at first sight, it appears to be fairly benign, but it is in fact an ambush. You walk into it and find that you are trapped.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0288">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am not walking into anything.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I got into trouble in the Chamber the other day for saying "you", Mr. McWilliam, but I meant it in the impersonal sense. It seems somewhat artificial to have to say "one" or to use the passive voice—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I accept the difficulty, but I did not make the rule, I only enforce it. The rule is that the word "you" refers to the Chair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept your ruling, Mr. McWilliam, and shall start again.<br><br>
The essence of the problem before the Committee is to elucidate an insidious Bill—insidious, I repeat, in the original sense of the word. It is an ambush. It appears to be benign when one approaches it and when one sees it from afar. It appears to be a boring bureaucratic adjustment of no substantive significance—something that should not hold the attention of politicians for more than a few minutes. <i>[Interruption.]</i> From that reaction, it is clear that that is the image of the Bill to which Labour Members are attached. That is precisely why we should be extremely wary, and why I am afraid that it is not possible to believe that the Government regard this as an administrative measure likely to produce greater efficiency in government.<br><br>
If we were persuaded that that was the case, we would have supported the Bill on Second Reading, and would be spending very little time on it this morning. We would probably have finished our proceedings by the coffee break. However, we must consider the Bill against the background of the Government's extraordinary attack on the national insurance system. I might have expected a Labour Government to do many damaging things to the country, but I would never have expected them to set about undermining—admittedly surreptitiously, but most effectively and systematically—the national insurance system. That is what is happening, and it is a very serious matter.<br><br>
For 50 years, everyone who has worked and paid national insurance contributions has believed, or has been brought up to believe, that, as a result, they would be entitled to certain non means-tested benefits. The Government have been undermining that system and have introduced a series of new benefits that are means tested, such as cold weather payments. Far worse and far more pernicious, they have been means testing benefits that were previously universal benefits to which anyone who had contributed would be entitled on a non means-tested basis. They have means-tested incapacity benefit beyond £50 and have abolished widows benefit and replaced it with a new means-tested benefit called bereavement benefit. Those matters will soon be discussed in relation to another Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman distinguish between time-limited benefits and means-tested benefits? The proposed bereavement benefit has no means-tested element; it has a time limit. The Government's proposals also extend benefits on a purely contributory basis to widowers.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are now discussing proposals in another Bill, which I have also read. Those who serve on the Committee that considers that Bill will have the dubious privilege of serving under my chairmanship again. We have enough to do on this Committee, so we should stick to the Bill that is before us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but provided that I have your support, Mr. McWilliam, to briefly correct in 30 seconds what would be a major misapprehension created by the Minister's intervention. No Opposition Member and no one in this country is naive enough to swallow the Minister's explanation. Clearly, time-limiting a benefit so that after six months you do not get it, and only income support—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. As far as I am aware, I am ineligible for any benefit whatever.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to change my turn of phrase.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman has served under my chairmanship for years. He knows my views on the rules regarding language—I am also uncomfortable with them, but they must and shall be enforced.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When one has contributed to the national insurance scheme for many years, one expects to benefit on the basis of the rules that existed when one contributed. Suddenly, without warning, a new Labour Government elected with a massive majority sets about the national insurance system with an axe, and destroys whole sections of it. One finds that a benefit to which one believed one was entitled as long as one qualified because of family circumstances or incapacity has been limited to six months, after which there is no benefit except a means-tested benefit. One naturally forms the conclusion that a universal contributory benefit has been replaced by a means-tested benefit after six months.<br><br>
I described the treatment of widows benefit—I know that <i>Hansard</i> will bear me out—as the benefit having been abolished and replaced with a bereavement benefit that will be means-tested after six months. That is the reality. I hope that we shall not proceed in such a disingenuous way in this Bill or in the Bill to which you referred, Mr. McWilliam.<br><br>
If the Labour Government are determined, as they appear to be, to erode the national insurance system, and if their large majority makes that possible—it may be that nothing can be done to stop them—they should at least be honest. The parliamentary process should not contribute to pulling the wool over the eyes of the British public; it should contribute to greater public understanding of these dramatic developments. Some of the great social progress of the 20th century is being reversed in the last years of the century by a party that has been associated with the national insurance principle throughout the century until now. I was brought up to believe that that principle was a matter of consensus in British public life, and that that had been so since the coalition Government of the second world war. It is sad that that is no longer the case.<br><br>

Against the background of the Government's systematic campaign to run down the national insurance principle and the national insurance system it is something of a fad—the matter needs to be considered in a new light. People do not realise what is happening. Nothing illustrates that better than the Minister's intervention. We must realise that this is one piece of a pernicious programme. It was not announced to the British public in the election; it has not even been announced honestly, openly and retrospectively now. But it has been pursued with remorseless determination and we do not know how far it will go. I hope that we can embarrass the Government slightly and possibly discourage them from taking this programme further—if not reversing what they have done at least slowing down the destruction of the national insurance system so that when we return to power there is enough to build on. If we achieve that, we will have achieved a major purpose.<br><br>
We have a Government who, while running down the contributory principle and the national insurance system, publish a Bill that establishes a separate organisation to collect national insurance contributions, which used to be collected under another system with a different flow of funds and purpose. The organisation involved had its own integrity, funding and Department to run it. That is now being folded into the Inland Revenue. Everything else flows from that.<br><br>
Some matters, which we will discuss shortly, look like details but are not. They contain nasty bugs, such as enforcement and the administrative measures needed to combine the two Departments for legal purposes, and are a part of a rolling programme to run down the national insurance system. Unless matters are viewed in that perspective, we cannot understand the significance of the Bill, in particular its timing and the way in which its real purpose is being disguised.<br><br>
I am disappointed with the Minister. I know him well—we have served together on Committees and the Treasury Select Committee. He is an able, forthright and open man. It is sad to see him enmeshed in the coils of this new Labour Government feeling that he has to go along with this project of disguising their real purpose. Perhaps in his heart of hearts he is ashamed to be a member of a Government who are attacking the national insurance system. One can only sympathise with the self-delusion displayed in his attempts to disguise the true reality of the provision.<br><br>
I do not want to go into more detail now on the general principles behind the Bill, but we will have to revert to them. Your usual attention and alertness show, Mr. McWilliam, that what I am saying is demonstrated in fact. It will be reflected as we go through each clause of this pernicious Bill. It is right that I state at the outset the essential principles that have informed the drafting of the Bill.<br><br>
I have no objection to the sittings motion. In your wisdom, Mr. McWilliam, you have changed the order of consideration. That does not matter unduly. You know much better than I do how we can modify the Bill in a coherent fashion.<br><br>
I do not know whether we can say that the Sergeant at Arms has a sense of humour, but he has allocated to us the largest Committee Room. I am delighted that we
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
manage to accommodate so many members of the public; I only wish that they could be brought a little nearer. As we try to rip some of the veils of subterfuge and new Labour spin doctoring from a sinister measure, it is important that the public should be given every facility to know what is going on and to look into the faces of new Labour Ministers when they make statements like the one that we have just heard.<br><br>
I do not know whether it is in order for me to make such a proposal, Mr. McWilliam. I may be trespassing on the sacred ground of the Serjeant at Arms, and heaven knows what would happen if I did that. I might lose my office or my telephone might be cut off. If it is not out of order, would it be possible to bring forward the barrier that separates us from those who sent us here and who want to take part in our proceedings?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take that last request as a point of order. I requested the Doorkeepers to put the rope across the Room so that people could move nearer. We have the pillars for the rope, but, unfortunately, the rope is in Committee Room 15—I say "the" rope advisedly. As a Committee is sitting in Room 15, the rope cannot be acquired at the moment, but it will be retrieved for future sittings. I apologise to the Committee for that.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ms Patricia Hewitt)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. I apologise for my slightly late arrival this morning. I was, as you know, detained elsewhere.<br><br>
I have written to you, Mr. McWilliam, about a previous interest. As the Bill transfers to the Inland Revenue not only the Contributions Agency but the new national insurance recording system—NIRS2—I want to declare the fact that I worked for Andersen Consulting, the contractor on the NIRS2 project, from September 1994 until March 1997. While Director of research for Andersen Consulting, I did not work on the NIRS2 project, nor have I had any financial relationship with Andersen Consulting since I left its employment. Although there is no obligation on me to declare that previous interest, I wish to do so in the spirit of openness that characterises this new Labour Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Lady.<br><br>
I remind the Committee that there is a financial resolution in connection with the Bill and it is available in the Committee Room.<br><br>
I also remind the Committee that adequate notice of amendments should be given. Starred amendments will not be called, including starred amendments which may be reached on an afternoon sitting, having been tabled in the morning.</span></p>

I also have a number of unremunerated interests, which are listed in the register. I cannot see at the moment how they might be relevant to our proceedings, but possibly they could be.</span></p>

<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Bill be considered in the following order, namely, Clause 1; Schedules 1 and 2; Clause 2; Schedule 3; Clauses 3 and 4; Schedule 4; Clause 5; Schedule 5; Clause 6; Schedule 6; Clauses 7 to 18; Schedule 7; Clauses 19 to 26; Schedules 8 to 10; remaining Clauses; new Clauses; new schedules.—[<i>Mr. Timms.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We do not come to any amendments until clause 7, so I remind the Committee that for those hon. Members who sometimes have difficulty in following what we are doing, there is a sheet showing the order in which I shall call the clauses and schedules.</span></p>
<div class='clause'><span class='label label-warning'>clause</span>
Clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
TRANSFER TO BOARD OF CERTAIN FUNCTIONS RELATING TO CONTRIBUTIONS, ETC.</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 1 is one of the key elements of the Bill, introducing schedules 1 and 2. Schedule 1 transfers to the Inland Revenue the day-to-day operational functions currently discharged by the Contributions Agency on behalf of the Secretary of State. Functions relating to national insurance contributions, statutory sick pay, statutory maternity pay and contracting-out matters will be exercised by the Inland Revenue from the day appointed for the operational transfer.<br><br>
Schedule 1 amends the provisions of Acts which confer such functions on the Secretary of State and also other provisions, which make consequential references to his exercise of those functions. Functions conferred on the Secretary of State by the subordinate legislation in schedule 2 are also transferred to the Inland Revenue.<br><br>
We intend that the day appointed for the transfer of operational functions under clause 28 should be 1 April, the start of the new financial year. Clause 28(2)(a) also allows regulations concerned with operational functions transferred under clause 1 to come into force on the passing of the Act, so that they can be in force by 1 April.<br><br>
I want to draw the shadow Chancellor's views on this subject to the attention of members of the Committee, particularly Conservative Members—although I am sad
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
that so few of them have taken the trouble to attend—especially in the light of the flight of fancy that we heard a moment ago. The shadow Chancellor said:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is a massive and unnecessary burden for employers to have to cope with two separate bureaucracies for matters concerning payroll taxes. It is also a wasteful duplication of government resources."</p></blockquote>
He went on:
<br><blockquote><p>"Ministers should commit themselves now to a merger of the field forces of the Inland Revenue and the CA. Apart from saving public money, this would eliminate the burden of double accountability and interference for employers, and reduce the time needed to cope with workplace taxation. This issue has been endlessly debated in Whitehall. A decision should now be made."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is praying in aid the argument that public money will be saved. What savings to public funds does the Minister expect to make from the merger of those two agencies?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There will be savings in public money, but the key issue is to reduce the load on business. The words that I quoted were from the Deregulation Task Force report. The hon. Gentleman may recall—I do not know whether it was his party's policy that he supported when it was in Government; I suspect that it was—that deregulation was considered a good thing, as was reducing the burden on business. The previous Government did not do as much of it as the shadow Chancellor wished they had. We are pressing ahead with this sensitive and technical change to allow businesses to deal with a single organisation rather than two. It is a change that the whole Committee should welcome.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to intervene again, but the Minister is adopting his usual technique—I hope that it does not become too much of a habit in the Committee—of trying to deflect the question instead of answering it. I did not ask about deregulation. Indeed, I am committed to deregulation. In the last Parliament I was a founder member and became vice-chairman of the Conservative Back-Bench deregulation committee.<br><br>
I asked the Minister a specific question about the expected savings to public funds from this measure. I cannot believe that any responsible Government—I know that this is not a responsible Government—would come before the Committee and propose a measure, praying in aid the argument that there will be savings to public funds, without being able to give the Committee the figures.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to note the hon. Gentleman's support for deregulation. To be consistent, he should support this measure. I imagine that he supports the work of the tax law review committee, of which he is or was a member, which has called for alignments of this kind.<br><br>
There will initially be additional costs to the public purse as a result of the transfer. They are spelt out in paragraph 251 of the explanatory notes, which no doubt the hon. Gentleman has read. The details are there for him to see.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me intervene—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. May I point out that what the Minister read out refers to the financial clause and money resolution, which should be properly debated.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0291">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. McWilliam.<br><br>
As the Minister rightly says, there is a passage in the explanatory notes on page 36 entitled, "The financial effects of the Bill", which sets out the costs. I distinctly heard the Minister quote from the document of which he is so fond, which was produced by my right hon. Friend the shadow Chancellor when he was a private business man during the previous Parliament, and which suggests that a merger of the Contributions Agency and the Inland Revenue, such as is now proposed, would involve substantial savings to public funds. I do not have the document in front of me, but if I have seriously misquoted it, no doubt the Minister will immediately rise to correct me.<br><br>
The Minister prayed in aid that argument, using it almost in an interrogatory way to ask why the Opposition do not support the proposal, if it will result in savings to public funds. That is a very strange state of affairs. The Government produced a document, of which we are all aware, which suggests that there will be costs to public funds. Maybe there will be savings in the longer term, and perhaps those savings will more than discount the costs, so there is a positive present value, but that calculation has not been included in the document.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It has.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case, perhaps the Minister will explain exactly the net position. I shall ask again the question that I asked a few moments ago, to which we must have an answer. What net savings to public funds are anticipated as a result of the Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to take up too much of the Committee's time on this subject, because the facts are clearly set out in paragraph 251 of the explanatory notes. I take it from your ruling a moment ago, Mr. McWilliam, that we should not spend too much time on this matter at this stage, but that paragraph clearly says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Early offsetting savings are estimated at £1.4 million in 2000–01 rising to £5.5 million in 2002–03 and thereafter. Further significant savings are expected in the medium to long term."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We still do not know the net position. I shall quote the relevant two sentences of the paragraph.
<br><blockquote><p>"The additional, transitional, cost of transferring the CA to the Inland Revenue is estimated at £14.8 million in 1998–99, £17.4 million in 1999–2000 and £6.2 million in 2000–01."</p></blockquote>
Those are considerable amounts of money, totalling nearly £40 million. In addition, there will be policy development costs of £0.3 million and various other costs.
<br><blockquote><p>"It is estimated that expenses of £11.1 million will be incurred under section 78."</p></blockquote>
If we add that amount, costs will total about £50 million. Then the note goes on to say,
<br><blockquote><p>"Early offsetting savings are estimated at £1.4 million rising to £5.5 million in 2002–03 and thereafter."</p></blockquote>
So, for the period covered by the document, the net position is substantially negative by more than £40 million, on a rule of thumb calculation. Perhaps it will become so substantially positive thereafter that, on a present value basis, the taxpayer will benefit, although no one who reads the explanatory notes would know that. Indeed, anyone
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
who reads the notes would be entitled to believe that the net position is negative. One would assume that if the Government had such a good argument, they would use it—if it were true that, on a net basis, the Bill will produce significant savings to public funds.<br><br>
I must ask the Minister to make the net position absolutely clear to the Committee. If he says that the net position will become positive after a certain number of years, will he set out the figures so that we can see to what extent that is so? That argument is key to the Bill, although not the most important one, which is the future and integrity of our national insurance system, and the Government's real intentions with regard to it. I would be prepared to pay several millions of pounds to preserve the national insurance system. The Minister has told the Committee twice that real savings, will be made, but he has not explained how the savings will be made. His figures add up to a negative "dissaving"—an actual and substantial cost to the taxpayer.<br><br>
I have been speaking for two or three minutes, during which time the Minister has, I hope, been able to think and consult in order to give the Committee a clear response.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to the central issue, which is not the cost to the Government but the two separate bureaucracies with which employers have to cope with in respect of matters concerning payroll taxes. The shadow Chancellor rightly referred to that as a "massive and unnecessary" burden. The Bill will deal with that problem.<br><br>
The explanatory notes to the Bill make it clear that savings will be made, rising to £5.5 million in 2002–03 and continuing thereafter. That will of course lead to substantial savings to the Exchequer, but the central issue remains the reduction of the burden on business.</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is not a satisfactory way for the Committee to proceed. I have raised a specific question about savings to the taxpayer. Instead of answering it, the Minister deflected it by talking about savings to business. Of course, savings to business should and will be discussed in due course, but my question was about savings to the taxpayer. The Minister is more than intelligent enough to understand the difference between the two. We are looking at different variables in the equation, which must be calibrated and quantified to decide whether, on a net basis and purely as an economic calculus, the Bill will represent good value to the public.<br><br>
We need answers. If the Minister knows them, why were they not included in the explanatory notes? If he does not know them, how can he justify his confident assertion that there will be savings to the taxpayer? It would be extraordinary to overlook such a crucial matter, but perhaps that is why the figures were omitted form the explanatory notes. Perhaps they were omitted for another, perfectly justifiable reason. In either case, we should be given the figures and the accompanying explanation.<br><br>
The Committee deserves to hear an answer to my specific question, rather than to another question, however interesting that question may be, and I hope that the Minister will now provide it.</span></p>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That this schedule be the First schedule to the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have started off on a thoroughly unsatisfactory basis. I am sure that those members of the public who are present, and who take the trouble to read the account of our proceedings in <i>Hansard,</i> will note that I have asked a specific question on the savings—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Hon. Members may not refer to people who are beyond the Bar of the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. McWilliam. Perhaps I may refer to the public as a whole. I am sure that all 56 million of them will pay great attention to our proceedings. We must think of ourselves as a vicarious Athenian democracy, in which everyone else participates through the medium of his or her elected representative.<br><br>
I do not wish to overemphasise the importance of our proceedings, but it is extremely significant that the Government have justified the provision partially and explicitly by reference to savings to public funds. They have advanced other excuses as well, which we shall probe with equal rigor. When we asked what the savings were, how they were calculated and what protections were in place we received no answer. It is clear that the Minister does not know the answer and has not thought about it. It is clear that there are no such savings; the costs are quoted in the explanatory memorandum. That means that that verbal inequation undoubtedly has a negative side. I do not know the net costs because we have not been told the full financial figures, but it is clear that there is a negative side. The burden borne by any other positive argument adduced by the Government to justify a fundamentally ill-conceived measure must therefore be correspondingly greater. That is the only logical conclusion than can be drawn.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
What is the point of a Committee in which one is supposed to ask questions of the Government and expect clear and coherent answers if we do not get any answers? If the Government use their massive new Labour majority to steamroller the whole thing through and to say "Get lost, Opposition, get lost, public, and even the traditions of the House"—<i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is entitled to be listened to by hon. Members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have specific questions about schedule 1. Paragraph 28(2, on page 21 refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"so much of any interest recovered by the Inland Revenue by virtue of paragraph 6 of Schedule 1 to the Contributions and Benefits Act or paragraph 6 of Schedule 2 to that Act as remains after the deduction by them of any administrative costs attributable to its recovery".</p></blockquote>
Who will arbitrate on the question of what are reasonable administrative costs of the recovery? We discovered on Second Reading and in graphic fashion this morning the extent to which the Government treat with contempt the concept of a separate national insurance fund, the integrity of which is at risk. Indeed, contributions to that fund will be the responsibility of the Inland Revenue. I have nothing against the Inland Revenue, which—certainly until now—has been extraordinarily well managed on the whole. Nevertheless, the culture of the Inland Revenue does not include any great regard for the national insurance fund. It is probably part of its culture to dislike or resent the presence of the national insurance fund. It is rubbing its hands with glee at the prospect of taking over the Contributions Agency, collecting all the money and merging operations into one. It no doubt believes that the next bite will be to take over the national insurance fund completely and merge it with the Consolidated Fund.<br><br>
Many of the provisions in the schedules to the Bill refer to the relationship between the Consolidated Fund and the national insurance fund. The Committee must consider those provisions with great care. How will the administrative costs be determined? In the private sector, if there is an efficient market, there is a buyer and a seller. My experience of merchant banking taught me that if one charged a client too much he would take his business elsewhere, so the extent of fees, charges or commissions would be determined by the market. No market exists within the Government, however, which is sad. The Contributions Agency is to lose its independence, which was one of the checks and balances in the system, and as a result there will be nobody to protect the interests of the national insurance fund. The Minister will not be able to do so as he will be emasculated by the Bill.<br><br>
On Second Reading, I spoke about paragraph 30(2)—as you may recall, Mr. McWilliam—which refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"such payments by way of adjustment as the Secretary of State determines (in accordance with any directions of the Treasury)".</p></blockquote>
That is germane to the issue of the relationship between the Consolidated Fund and the national insurance fund, and it relates to the principle underlying all the points that I will make under this schedule. The purpose of the Bill is to make what remains of the Department of Social Security the creature of the Treasury and the Revenue in this context. Any powers that the Secretary of State retains are to be exercised on instruction from the Treasury.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0293">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
It reminds me of when the Labour Government nationalised the Bank of England in 1945. I remember in my former professional capacity having to look at the Bank of England Act 1946, which was quite an interesting Act. In every paragraph the Treasury's consent was required, with phrases such as "as determined by the Treasury". It was obvious that the Bank of England had been turned into a Department of the Treasury. The Labour Government have now gone back on that. They have taken about 50 years to see the errors of their original way. What remains of Department of Social Security functions in this field will also be carried out at the Treasury's behest.<br><br>
It is no use saying that the Secretary of State is the protector of the national insurance fund. He would have been up to now, but his powers are being exercised only in calls for direction by the Treasury and the Inland Revenue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Collins <span class='memberconstituency'>(Westmorland and Lonsdale)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may have put his finger on the answer to the question to which we have not received a reply. Why can the Government not quantify the administrative and other savings as a result of the schedule? Clearly, there is an intention to abolish the Department of Social Security, abolish its Ministers and abolish their entitlement to free cars and free trips on Concorde. Perhaps that would achieve considerable administrative savings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I cannot see any of that arising out of schedule 1.<br><br>
Further to the speech that the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford is making, I ceased to be a general commissioner some 22 years ago, so I am not taking his remarks as a criticism of the Chair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Your past is so distinguished, Mr. McWilliam, that it is difficult to remember all your various roles. Had I been aware of that, I would have been careful. However, you should interpret my remarks as an unknowing and, therefore, all-the-more genuine and appreciated compliment to the commissioners, because I have been defending the independence of the two systems that have existed until now—the Contributions Agency and the Revenue, with their different appeal tribunals, different commissioners and so forth, it is worrying that these structures are now being fused into one. We all know that it is a takeover by the Inland Revenue.<br><br>
As I have several questions for the Minster, perhaps he will note them down. He is an intelligent man, but he may forget them if I ask several in a row. He might even give into the temptation of pretending to forget some of them, if they are awkward to respond to—who knows? If that happens, the purpose of the Committee will be subverted and the transparency of government, a phrase that I know new Labour likes to use, will be shown to be a sham.<br><br>
Who determines the administrative costs, and what protection is there against the Revenue, which now has a management accounting system that is replicated in the private sector? It will be nice to be able to say, "That's all right. We can lay off a whole lot of these costs on the poor national insurance fund, which is there for the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
picking. We have been given this wonderful slush fund. Laying off some of our costs on that will be good for my budget. I can have more staff and more overheads." To do that is only human nature. That is why there are checks and balances in the system. I am not implying any dishonesty or maladministration. I am simply referring to the usual, almost respectable, bureaucratic instinct to empire-build—<i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is a lot of chatter; I should like to listen to the hon. Member.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Such an instinct is combined with the natural pressure of any cost accounting system in which people have delegated budgetary responsibility. Naturally, they want to recover their costs as far as possible from an outside organisation. They cannot recover the costs from the public without the danger that the public will object and appeal to the commissioners, who, in the best tradition that you represent, Mr. McWilliam, will give the public a fair hearing. However, they can apparently recover whatever they want from the national insurance fund. There will be nobody to say, "Wait a moment. That's not fair. You're taking too much money. What are you doing paying for all these limousines and computers out of the national insurance fund?" The Contributions Agency will not be involved; those left will be working for the Revenue, dependent on it for pay, rations, promotion and so on, and no doubt whipped into line. Ministers will have lost their powers and will be able to act only in accordance with instructions.<br><br>
My second question relates to paragraph 30, on page 22, which substitutes part of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 with the following subsection:
<br><blockquote><p>"There shall be made out of the National Insurance Fund into the Consolidated Fund, or out of money provided by Parliament into the National Insurance such payments by way of adjustment as the Secretary of State determines (in accordance with any directions of the Treasury)".</p></blockquote>
If that is not disingenuous wording, I do not know what is.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
What is the difference between
<br><blockquote><p>"such payments by way of adjustment as the Secretary of State determines (in accordance with any directions of the Treasury)"</p></blockquote>
and such payments as the Treasury determines? There is no difference. The Treasury will decide how much money it wants to take out of the national insurance fund. It will send an instruction, like people in business who send chits to accountants, for example, to pay the window cleaner. The Minister will handle that.<br><br>
I do not exaggerate; there is no hyperbole. I invite Labour Members to read the text. New Labour has a vast majority. Can any of its Members tell me where I have gone wrong? What is the substantive difference between saying that such payments shall be made in accordance with Treasury directions, and saying that such payment shall be made by the Secretary of State in accordance with Treasury directions? There is no difference. The reference to the Secretary of State is purely disingenuous window dressing. All new Labour is doing is wasting public money by sending chits around Whitehall.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
The Minister, whom the Secretary of State has delegated to do the menial task, has no option or right to say that I have a point. He cannot say that he is worried about the money and the defence of the national insurance fund because he has to observe Treasury directions. That is what the Labour Government did in 1945 when they emasculated the Bank of England. The Bank had to do whatever the hell it was told. If it was told to sell the gold reserves, it sold the gold reserves. It was staffed by clerks who acted like a computer would now, fulfilling an instruction mechanically. That is the Minister's position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am having trouble understanding the hon. Member's line. I cannot find a reference in the Bill to the gold reserve.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was a brief allusion which took no more than about nine words. I have tried to be strictly relevant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was nine words, but it was nine words on more than one occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Labour Members are not intervening, Mr. McWilliam; someone has to play their role. They must be embarrassed by the Bill, I had expected one brave soul to rise to defend the Government—if the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller), for example, wants to intervene, I shall give way—and say that my interpretation is wrong. If I am right, however, then everything that I have said has been an understatement of the destruction of the independence of our national insurance system and its submission to the whims and fancies of the Treasury and the Revenue.<br><br>
I have no idea whether the Minister will give me an answer. No Labour Member has given the slightest sign that I have exaggerated or misconceived the situation. They sit in stunned silence. No one call tell me where I am going wrong. I believe that I am not going wrong, and I ask the Minister to answer my questions. What checks and balances are in place to ensure that the determination of administrative costs in paragraph 28 is fair and reasonable? Secondly, and even more important, what protections are in place to prevent paragraph 30 being used at will to rob the national insurance fund?<br><br>
I want answers to these questions. There are one or two things that Oppositions can do in Committees when they do not get any answers at all, and I think that you will agree, Mr. McWilliam, that it is in the interests of parliamentary democracy that we should not be unduly inhibited in doing those things. I mean that seriously. We expect answers. No doubt the new Labour Government can win any vote with their vast majority. They can no doubt make a horse the Secretary of State for Social Security, since one does not need to be anything more than a horse to observe the Treasury's instructions. The Treasury may put a jockey and a good bridle on the horse, but the jockey probably does not need a stick or spurs, because the horse will do what it is told. That is the position that we are now in.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
I have a third question with which I want the Minister to deal. Why is there reference in the schedule to the Secretary of State? As the Secretary of State will be operating only under instructions from the Treasury, why is such a reference necessary? If the Minister were half serious, 10 per cent. serious or 1 per cent. serious, it would not be necessary. I fear that we have revealed that he was not serious when he said in the clause 1 stand part debate that he believed that there would be savings to public funds from merging the two agencies. If he were half-serious abut that, why did he not say "The role of the Secretary of State for Social Security—and the other Ministers—is bogus and purely mechanical; he just has to follow instructions".? We have no data on which we can protest or say anything at all. It has just been a waste of time. Private Secretaries will ring up one another, and paper will go around Whitehall completely uselessly, because the Minister will have given away any statutory power that he still has, and will have, until this pernicious Bill goes through, to defend the interests of the national insurance fund.<br><br>
Why is there this proliferation of Ministers, this charade, this completely bogus role for Ministers who have no power to decide, question or resist? If they have such power, why is it not in the Bill? Perhaps the Government will table an amendment to satisfy us on that point.<br><br>
This theme runs through the Schedule. There is hardly a paragraph that does not refer to such payments,
<br><blockquote><p>"as the Inland Revenue determine".</p></blockquote>
In some cases the Secretary of State is substituted by the Inland Revenue or the Treasury; in some cases the Secretary of State remains, but he does what the Inland Revenue tells him to do.<br><br>
It is a curious procedure, because, logically, the Secretary of State's role in this should be abolished. The Government should have the courage and honesty to tell the British people that that is what they are doing. The whole thing is being run by the Revenue, and there is no longer any distinction between the national insurance fund and the consolidated fund: the national insurance fund is simply part of the funds that the Revenue manages. What is more, the Revenue has the power, as we see it, to make disbursements out of the fund, to pay themselves expenses and all the rest of it. The Minister might say that the Government acknowledge that, but add, "But I am making some administrative savings to justify it." I would not accept that argument. It would not for one second be worth destroying the national insurance fund, even if administrative savings could be made, but at least the Government would say that they were doing so.<br><br>
The Government are creating the worst of all possible worlds. They are destroying the independence of the national insurance fund, but are not telling the British public the truth about it. That is why the Bill retains these bogus references, as I have argued—so far without contradiction—to the Secretary of State. Thirdly, they are not even making administrative savings. If that is not a bad deal for the British public, I do not know what is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Collins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I begin by expressing my pleasure at serving for the first time under your chairmanship, Mr. McWilliam?<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0295">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford made a powerful case for believing schedule 1 to be sinister. He said, accurately, that it is pernicious. I want to ask the Minister a practical question about the timetable for implementation of the provisions in schedule 1.<br><br>
I compliment my hon. Friend on his comments on paragraph 30 of schedule 1. He was accurate when he said earlier that he was understating his case. Throughout schedule 1, particularly in paragraph 30, there are major constitutional implications. I remember that when studying British constitution O-level in dusty rooms at school 20 years ago. One of the central guiding principles of the British constitution was that all Cabinet Ministers are equal, with the arguable exception of the Prime Minister, who is primus inter pares. All other Ministers are pares, or equal one to the other, yet paragraph 30 contains a clear provision whereby the Secretary of State is to be directed by the Treasury. It does not specify who in the Treasury that will be. It could be argued that, as First Lord of the Treasury, it could be the Prime Minister, in which case there may be no major constitutional violation. But in the ordinary usage of legal language, directions of the Treasury would be interpreted as meaning either of the Chancellor of the Exchequer or of any other Ministers in the Treasury. The potential exists for one Cabinet Minister to issue instructions to another. That is a major constitutional departure and a breach of the principle of collective responsibility and collective Cabinet government. The potential also exists for junior Ministers outside the Cabinet—for example, the Paymaster General—to issue a direction to a Secretary of State.<br><br>
I shall be interested in the Minister's opinion on that sinister and unique development. I wonder whether he has discussed the matter with his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security and whether his right hon. Friend is content with the position. As a former Chief Secretary to the Treasury, his appointment to Secretary of State for Social Security was no doubt hailed as promotion—that is how it was reported in the newspapers, spun no doubt by Mr. Alastair Campbell—but perhaps it was not promotion; perhaps it was demotion. Perhaps, in the light of the Bill, any post within the Department of Social Security, up to and including Secretary of State, should be considered in the pecking order as being inferior to any post, however junior, in the Treasury. That might explain the extraordinary influence wielded by the previous Paymaster General, whose departure caused us all so much grief over Christmas.<br><br>
I am worried about the constitutional implications of schedule 1. I hope that the Minister will tell us whether he has had specific discussions with his Secretary of State, whether he has received an assurance from the Secretary of State that he is content with the provision, and whether he sought advice from the various constitutional experts—for example, those serving on the Neill committee and the Royal Commission set up to consider the future of the House of Lords. Even if one finds it undesirable, as I do, to put a Cabinet Minister in a position of subordination to another Minister, at least elected power is being made
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
subordinate to another form of elected power. However, paragraph 35(4), which relates to section 9(2)(b) of the Pension Schemes Act 1993, states:
<br><blockquote><p>"In subsection (4), for 'Secretary of may, if he thinks' there is substituted 'Inland Revenue may, if they think'."</p></blockquote>
Clearly, that will transfer power from an elected person, the Secretary of State, to the board of the Inland Revenue, which is unelected. Of course, there are legislative provisions that subject the board to the direction of Treasury Ministers. However, if the sole implication is that the provision is simply another instance of a Secretary of State being subordinated to his ministerial colleagues in the Treasury, why does not the provision state as much? In that case, it would have helped the Committee, the public and others concerned with the Bill if paragraph 35(4) had stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"'Treasury Ministers may, if they think'",</p></blockquote>
rather than the
<br><blockquote><p>"'Secretary of State may, if he thinks'".</p></blockquote>
Instead, it states that there will be a transfer from the thought processes of the Secretary of State—which may be clear or ambiguous—to those of the Inland Revenue, in its infinite wisdom. That raises serious and wide public policy issues. It is another instance of a decisions hitherto taken by those who are accountable to the electorate being taken by those who, at best, are indirectly accountable to the electorate. The matter is serious and should give pause to all elected Members, who participated in an election in which a major issue was the then Opposition's cry against the growth of quangos and the transfer of power from the elected to the unelected.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
That is a sinister and serious development and I should welcome the Minister's comments on it. I hope that he can assure the Committee that he has consulted widely on the provision. Will he advise on the general Government policy on the appropriate level of decision making? When discussing such matters, hon. Members must bear in mind that people can go to prison for violating laws relating to taxation and national insurance. It is vital that all relevant decisions are taken by those who are clearly and demonstrably elected.<br><br>
I promised earlier that I would return to a practical point that the Minister should consider, and I would like to fulfil that pledge. In speaking to both clause 1 and schedule 1, he said that the Government intend to implement the provisions of schedule 1 at the beginning of the next tax year—April 1999. Serious issues arise from that timing.<br><br>
As we know, 1999 is the year before the millennium. The Prime Minister himself has said on more than one occasion—both in the House of Commons and on public platforms—that businesses that use payroll and computer systems across the public and private sectors should ensure their readiness to tackle the millennium bug. However, the transfer of functions, which will have serious implications for Contributions Agency, Benefits Agency, Inland Revenue and Treasury computer systems, will take place only eight or nine months before the millennium bug may kick in. That is precisely the time when task forces should be rushing up and down in the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0296">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
Contributions Agency, checking their payroll systems and computer software to make sure that it is fully millennium-compliant. The transfers that schedule 1 will put into effect, and the timing that the Minister has announced, will distract the attention of the information technology specialists at the Contributions Agency and the Inland Revenue from what, surely, should be their more urgent task in the next few months: making sure that all their computers are fully millennium-compliant.<br><br>
Perhaps the Minister can assure us that the Contributions Agency is so stuffed with brilliant information technology specialists, and that its record on dealing with new technology is so wonderful, that we have no reason to fear. However, sadly, that is not wholly consistent with the record of the Contributions Agency—I see that my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford agrees with me—in introducing the NIRS2 system. Probably, of all the Departments and agencies in Whitehall, the Contributions Agency is the last one that should be assumed to have every information and computer problem wholly under control. The Contributions Agency is the last agency that should be expected, in this year of all years, to take its eye off the ball of millennium compliance and spend its time worrying about integrating its computer system with that of the Inland Revenue. The record of the Contributions Agency on new technology is, frankly, appalling.<br><br>
That is a powerful argument for saying that the provisions of schedule 1 should not come into force at the time advocated by the Minster and that 1999 is the wrong year in which to implement the transfer. Surely, it would be more sensible to wait a little. I should be most interested to hear what the Minster has to say about the training and commitment that will be required of IT staff. What assessment has been made of the software implications of schedule 1? What consultation has there been with the private sector? Have the provisions of schedule 1 been specifically checked with the Government's millennium compliance task force?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is making a very strong case. Does he agree that the speed of the proposed transfer is a little indecent, even suspect? Has it occurred to him that one reason for the Bill might be that things are in such a mess that the Minister and his colleagues are desperate to get shot of all this rubbish as quickly as possible, so that another Department can take responsibility for it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Collins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an interesting point. He may be a little more cynical than I am—perhaps not. That might be the reason. We know that the Secretary of State has got into all sorts of difficulties trying to explain the timetable for resolving the problems relating to NIRS2. He originally said that it would take a matter of weeks; more recently, he said months and, more recently still, that it could be far off in the future. He does not know when it will happen.<br><br>
My hon. Friend might be right. The reason why the Government have decided to trigger the provisions of schedule 1 may simply be so that the Department can
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
get shot, to use his phrase, of the problem as rapidly as possible—certainly well in advance of when the Secretary of State might be hoping to impress the Prime Minster by his record in the Department, in the hope of gaining further promotions in years ahead. It would be especially worrisome if that were so. I hope that the Minister can give the Committee a categorical assurance that no wish to be rid of the NIRS2 problem entered into the calculations of the Department and Ministers in deciding when schedule 1 would come into force.<br><br>
There is a further difficulty with the Minster's choice of April 1999 as the date on which the schedule will come into force. Earlier, we heard a very interesting conversation between my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford and the Minister on the subject of net and gross costs. I was interested that the Minister did not refer to what Baroness Hollis said in another place at the end of last year when she confirmed that the costs were likely to be £16 million or £17 million in each of the first two years, and possibly several million pounds thereafter.<br><br>
The Government have chosen to start the process in 1999. If they start to incur what, on their own admission, are significant costs during the handover period, surely they would prefer to do that in a year's time when, according to the economic cycle, the British economy will be more able to bear the implications of additional public expenditure. But what is the economic prognosis for the calendar year 1999? The Government's over-optimistic estimate is that growth in 1999 will be significantly down on growth in 1998 and about half of what they inherited in 1997. The consensus of independent forecasters expects growth in this calendar year to be negligible, possibly non-existent or, on a technical interpretation, even going into recession.<br><br>
The Minister must clarify what consideration was given to whether these expensive provisions, which are likely to result in expenditure of more than £32 million in the next two financial years, should be introduced when the United Kingdom economy is growing more slowly than at any time in the past eight or nine years, and far more slowly than most other western industrialised countries and the European average. Is this the sensible time to trigger provisions in schedule 1 that have such serious expenditure implications for public finance?<br><br>
The Minister has raised major questions. Will he reassure me that concrete discussions between his officials, those in the Treasury and the agencies involved and the Government's millennium-compliance task force have taken place on the ability of the Contributions Agency's existing system to cope with the millennium bug, and that the transfer under schedule 1 will not complicate those provisions? Will he also reassure me on the matter raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Grantham and Stamford, that a desire to get rid of the NIRS2 project did not lie behind the decision to trigger the provisions relatively early, in the lifetime of this Parliament? Finally, will he confirm that the Government have given proper consideration to the impact that the additional public expenditure will have on the UK economy at a time when it is growing so slowly?</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had no intention of speaking now because this is an administrative measure that makes eminent sense. But having heard words such as "bogus", "charade", "sinister", "pernicious" and "disingenuous", none of which appears in the Bill—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not referring to any member of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take your point, Mr. McWilliam. I was merely quoting the words used by Opposition Members who have clearly forgotten that in 1995, a joint working party was set up between the two Departments. <i>Hansard</i> records a number of exchanges between myself and others. The then Secretary of State for Social Security, the right hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley), recognised that there would be closer integration of the two Departments. I was interested in the matter, as I am sure you were, Mr. McWiliam, and pressed the Secretary of State on data protection issues that were consequent on the merger of such systems. He agreed that changes needed to take place, which they have following the European directive and primary legislation.<br><br>
It is interesting that such a bogus, sinister, pernicious and disingenuous charade of a Bill has attracted only 50 per cent. of Opposition Members on the Committee to attend. It cannot therefore be that important. To clarify matters for the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford, I should say that the detailed computer notes in my hand did not come from Millbank but arrived at quarter-past 10 o'clock when I was sitting at the Members' terminal in the Library. One can find some interesting matches between the words "Lilley" and "computer" by searching the text of <i>Hansard;</i> indeed, some relate to issues raised by hon. Members.<br><br>
It is inappropriate for the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford to suggest that the Bill did not have some origins in the thinking of the previous Government. The thought process that resulted in the Bill has had currency among officials in the Department since the working party was set up in 1995.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Collins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If it is the hon. Gentleman's contention that the Bill stems—in a long clear line—from the previous Government's work, how does he reconcile that with a Minister's written answer to the House in 1995. That answer stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"It was concluded that the overlap between the Revenue and the agency did not warrant an amalgamation of the two businesses. In addition, any efficiency gains would be outweighed by transitional costs and disruption to both departments."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 14 June 1995; Vol. 261, c. 516.]</p></blockquote>
That was the previous Government's position; it is a contradiction to say that the Bill stems from that position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We can exchange comments for ever about who said what to whom in the previous Government. I could cite a huge number of contradictory instances, which I would be happy to show the hon. Gentleman outside the Committee, but I do not want to detain the Committee unnecessarily.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not part of my purpose in the Committee to defend the previous Administration—we are not interested in a historical exercise—but, in the interests of fairness, I must take up this point. The previous Government examined the possibility of merging the two departments—for which there may be internal bureaucratic pressure, as I have hinted—and conducted a proper study including a cost-benefit analysis. They concluded that it did not make sense and that the costs exceeded the benefits in financial terms. I put that point to the Minister as forcefully as I could in the stand part debate, although he spectacularly failed to respond. Does the hon. Gentleman not recognise the distinction between what I have described and his claim of complicity with a future Government who might take exactly the opposite decision to that taken by the previous Conservative Administration? There is no evidence for his assertion; in fact, the evidence is against it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman rises, interventions should merely be interventions. That last intervention was somewhat long.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To answer the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford, if the principle was worth examining during the previous Government, It is improper to describe the Bill as bogus, a charade, sinister, pernicious and disingenuous. The hon. Gentleman cannot have it both ways.<br><br>
I now move on to the latest report from Taskforce 2000, which the Opposition are fond of using as their source. The report describes the DSS as well prepared for the consequences of the millennium date-change problem. That is interesting given some of the extremely complex issues faced by my hon. Friend the Minister and others in the Department, resulting from contracts signed by the previous Government. Let us be clear: that is the root cause of the problems that we face. Even the hon. Gentleman's friends in Taskforce 2000 are clear about the progress that has been made.<br><br>
As someone who spends a great deal of time studying these matters, I am confident that the progress that can result from the Bill can be achieved without any additional risk to the integrity of computer systems. Some problems need addressing, and I know that my hon. Friend the Minister is working hard to address the problems that he inherited from the previous Administration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston for that well-informed, illuminating, concise and to-the-point contribution, which will have refreshed the whole Committee.<br><br>
I do not need to detain the Committee long in responding to the few points of substance in the two speeches that preceded my hon. Friends's. I appreciate that the hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale is quite a new member of the House, but social security legislation and regulation-making powers are all under Treasury direction. Indeed, the language in schedule 1 simply reproduces the language long used in social
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0298">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
security legislation and does not change in substance any of the points that hon. Members suggested were being changed.<br><br>
The Secretary of State for Social Security retains policy responsibility for benefits, including statutory sick pay and statutory maternity pay. He retains operational responsibility for the Benefits Agency's benefits, and so needs, and will continue to have, access to the national insurance fund.<br><br>
As regards the point raised by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford, the language used in paragraphs 28 and 30 is lifted straight from the Social Security Administration Act 1992. He queried particularly the point about the Secretary of State being under the direction of the Treasury. It follows the existing wording of the subsection being amended, section 165(1) of that Act, which was introduced by the previous Government. It refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"such payments by way of adjustment as the Secretary of State determines (in accordance with any directions of the Treasury)".</p></blockquote>
The schedule makes no change to the substance either. The checks and balances in the organisation are precisely as they have been since 1992, and in many cases long before that, and no problems have arisen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: the Minister has just told the committee that the language of paragraph 28 is the same as in the Social Security Administration Act 1992. However, paragraph 28 explicitly says that that shall be "amended as follows". The Minister cannot get away from the fact that there is new wording there. What is the purpose of that new wording and what protections will be in place to prevent the national insurance fund from being milked unduly by the Revenue?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The wording has been changed, because we are transferring the Contributions Agency from the Department of Social Security to the Inland Revenue. That is why the schedule is required. As my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston rightly said, it is a technical exercise which requires extensive changes to the wording, the substance and, in particular, the extent of the Treasury direction are not being changed.<br><br>
The protections offered in regard to the administrative costs attributable to recovery are precisely as they have been sine the 1992 Act was introduced. Responsibility is being transferred from the Department of Social Security and the Secretary of State to the Inland Revenue, which need concern nobody.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It does concern me. It is a fundamental principle that when Parliament is legislating, it should examine such matters afresh and decide whether it is satisfied with simply replicating the wording of earlier Act. The Minister started by saying that nothing had changed, but he has now acknowledged that the wording has been amended. Will he answer my question: what checks and balances will prevent the Revenue from overcharging the national insurance fund for the expenses referred to in the schedule?<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
Irrespective of precedent, we must satisfy ourselves that we are happy with the law that we are discussing. I am not happy when the Minister refuses to answer my specific question: what are the protections?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Inland Revenue is accountable to Treasury Ministers and Parliament in exercising this and every other function. The protections are the same as always. In substance, they have not changed from the position introduced in the 1992 Act.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to move on now; we have spent enough time on that issue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. It is not for a Minister of the Crown to decide how much time the Committee spends on a specific issue. The Minister's comment was arrogant and I wonder whether, on reflection, he might like to withdraw it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It struck me that the hon. Gentleman asked the Minister to give way and the Minister declined to do so. That is any hon. Member's right. What he said is a matter for him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale raised a query about paragraph 35. He was concerned that the effect would be to substitute unelected civil servants for the elected Secretary of State. In fact, the provision covers the exercise of an operational function, not a policy-making function. In practice, that function is carried out by unelected civil servants in the Department of Social Security on behalf of the Secretary of State. Again, there is no change to the substance of what is happening.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford suggested that the Secretary of State was being made subject to the direction of the Inland Revenue. That is not so and nothing in the schedule puts the Secretary of State in that position. I can confirm that the Secretary of State is entirely happy with all the provisions of the Bill.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale queried the timing. The transfer has been planned alongside Department of Social Security's information technology strategy. Stopping or postponing the transfer now would increase the problems and cause disruption by separating the transfer work from the other information technology changes. The date for the transfer was announced by the Chancellor almost a year ago, so there has been plenty of time to prepare for it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Collins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston referred earlier to Taskforce 2000. Will the Minister answer my specific question: has Taskforce 2000 been consulted on the information technology implications of the transfer?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Taskforce 2000 has reported on the whole range of millennium compliance issues affecting the Government. My hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston reminded me that it specifically credited
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0299">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 29</span>
the Department of Social Security as being well prepared to face the millennium problem. That is also the case in respect of other private-sector agencies that have considered the matter. The Department of Social Security and all its agencies, including the Contributions Agency, have done very good work and continue to do so in preparing computer systems for the millennium. It is vital that they continue to operate through the millennium period because so many people depend on them. Taskforce 2000 has commended the work of the Department and regular reports are made to Parliament on the preparations being made throughout Government for the millennium bug problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that I was wrong and that the schedule refers not to the submission of the Department of Social Security to the Revenue, but only to its submission to the Treasury. I refer him to paragraphs 24 and 25. Paragraph 24 says,
<br><blockquote><p>"In section 121(5) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 for 'Secretary of State', in each place where it occurs, there is substituted 'Inland Revenue'."</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 25 says that the regulations that will be made by the Secretary of State will be, thereafter,
<br><blockquote><p>"'made with the concurrence of the Inland Revenue'"</p></blockquote>
and the paragraph continues at (b),
<br><blockquote><p>"for 'for the purposes of his functions' there is substituted 'or the Inland Revenue, for the purposes of their respective functions'."</p></blockquote>
The phrase,
<br><blockquote><p>"'made with the concurrence of the Inland Revenue'"</p></blockquote>
has exactly the same effect as the other phrase that I quoted earlier in the debate,
<br><blockquote><p>"in accordance with any directions of the Treasury".</p></blockquote>
Again, the Government are using different formulae to pull the wool over people's eyes, the reality is that the Department of Social Security has become an executive clerks' branch of the Revenue or the Treasury. Whether the Government say that something can be done only with the concurrence of the Revenue or that it must be done on the authorisation of the Treasury, it all adds up to the same thing: the Revenue and the Treasury are running the show. There should be no marks for trying to hide the reality of the picture, which is grim.<br><br>
12.15 pm<br><br>
I am even more concerned about the fact that, once again, the Minister declined to answer my question. Is this how we are going to scrutinise the Bill, clause by clause and schedule by schedule? It will be an historic case, quoted in the constitutional textbooks my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale has read them all, although I have not had that privilege—primus inter pares and the rest of it. It will be remembered that, in February 1999, a Bill went through the House of Commons, disguised in new Labour wrapping as a purely administrative measure, but which actually had a very pernicious effect because it was a blatant attack on the integrity of the national insurance system. It will be memorable for the fact that, as each clause and schedule was debated, the Minister declined to answer questions. Last time, the question was about costs. This time, it is about protections.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
It is no use saying that the problems already existed, or that the previous Government should have done something about it. The Labour Government are now in power, and I am asking them what they are doing about it. In fact, I am asking what might be thought of as an even softer question: whether the Minister is satisfied. I did not even receive an answer to my factual question about what protections there will be. We are wasting our time and our constituents' time, and we are wasting public money by having a debate in which the Minister declines—because he is either unable or unwilling, but I suspect because he is unwilling—to answer questions.<br><br>
The Minister is probably unwilling to answer questions because the answers might be embarrassing and might reveal the real reason for the project, which is to drive a coach and horses through the national insurance system. The Government are pretending that that is not the case, so they befuddle the debate by using different words and phrases to describe the same thing. They try to hide the fact that the Secretary of State will have no power by saying that he will do things under directions from the Treasury of the Revenue, by going off at a tangent and talking about previous Administrations and about what people did in the private sector before they became Members of Parliament. That may all be amusing, but we must deal with the substance of the debate and decide what the real nature of the Bill is.<br><br>
It is becoming increasingly clear that the Conservative party's interpretation of the Bill is correct. I dare say that many Labour Members are not especially proud to be serving on this Committee because the Bill will do great damage to the integrity of the national insurance system. The Labour party used to believe in the national insurance system as strongly as we did. In that respect, it is a sad day.<br><br>
There is a second issue that should concern the Committee. Even if these proposals go into the wrong direction, we should know what the reality is because we have had an open debate and the proposals have received proper parliamentary scrutiny. The British public could them make up their minds whether they like the fact that, contrary to all the general vibes and rhetoric, and completely unforseen in any manifesto commitment, the new Labour Government set about the national insurance system as soon as they came to power. The British public must be clear about that and they can make their decision at the next election. I have a good idea what that decision will be. That is how democracy should work. However, it is the Committee's role to elucidate and clarify. If we cannot amend, we must at least elucidate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Collins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In support of my hon. Friend's powerful case that we need greater elucidation from the Minister, one reason for the lack of straightforward answers from the Minister on the Government's policy in respect of the national insurance fund, and why they were not clear about it in the run-up to the general election, is that Labour's plans to change the national insurance system were commonly supposed to have been central to its defeat in the 1992 election. That is perhaps why they are not being as level and straightforward as they could be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the history of the later decades of the 20th century in Britain comes to be written, the great theme may well be that the Labour party found it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0300">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
impossible to win power when it revealed its real plans to the electorate, so it fastened upon a brilliant way of winning power. They hired extremely expensive and clever spin doctors such as the Mandelsons, the Campbells—I am sorry for the right hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Mandelson)—and the rest of their cohorts, and somehow disguised reality by packaging it attractively so that people would swallow it without realising what it was. There is no doubt that it has worked, but I trust that it will not work for much longer. The Minister is very much in that mode. I am sorry about that, as I think that it goes against the grain of his basic character. He is avoiding and evading key questions. He is doing it again here.<br><br>
I do not want to hear a long historical disputation, and nor do the public. They do not want to know what private citizens believed before they came to the House. They want to know what the Government are about, they want to know the effect of the schedule and they want the answer to the question that I have just asked the Minister.<br><br>
Here we have a national insurance fund entirely at the mercy of the Revenue. There are no checks or balances and the Secretary of State and the Ministers are withdrawing from responsibility in this area. The previous formulation may have been excessively weak. If we had been discussing the matter in 1992 or 1952, we might legitimately have tabled amendments to strengthen the protections. That is a perfectly good argument to deploy. However, in those days, there was a strong Department of Social Security which was regarded as the guardian of the integrity of the national insurance system. That has gone and Ministers have given away their powers or accepted that they will exercise them only under the directions of the Treasury or—I think that I have got it right—of the Revenue in certain cases.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are now on the third round of the same questions and arguments. It is tedious repetition and I must direct the hon. Gentleman to desist. He has asked his questions, he can invite the Minister to reply, but he cannot ask them a third time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Even if I do not get an answer, Mr. McWilliam, It seems to me to be an essential part of the functions of the Committee to insist on one.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am bound by standing orders. The standing order bans tedious repetition. If the hon. Gentleman asks the same questions twice and then starts to ask them a third time, whether or not he is satisfied with the answer, it is still tedious repetition and he must desist. He must obey my ruling.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would not have occurred to me in years not to obey your ruling, Mr. McWilliam. However, this is an interesting point, because "tedious repetition" is a phrase that is often used—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I will not brook a challenge to my chairmanship or my direction on tedious repetition. I have ruled.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I make an observation on the principle?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'> Order. The hon. Gentleman may not make an observation, because, by making an observation, he is challenging my chairmanship, and he may not do that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would not do that, Mr. McWilliam. I am certain, however, from everything that you have said and the context in which you have said it, that you did not have in mind that I was wilfully wasting the time of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. May I make it clear to the hon. Gentleman that I did not have in mind that the hon. Gentleman was wasting the time of the Committee? I had in mind the standing order that directs me to rule out of order an hon. Member who makes repetitive points or arguments, however long or short they may be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. McWilliam. I have had a certain amount of experience of being on Committees in the House, but not, as I have already said, on a Standing Committee considering social security legislation. I have never encountered the same difficulty in getting answers.<br><br>
Mr. McWilliam, you know the question that I have put to the Minister. The Minister now knows the question. He understands why I have repeated it as many times as you have allowed me to get away with it—so that there can be no doubt about what the question is. If I do not get an answer to another question, I want an answer to that question: what are the protections? Will the Minister first describe them and, secondly, tell us why he is not strengthening them, given that the traditional role of the Department of Social Security as the protector of the national insurance system is being changed and, indeed, destroyed by the Bill?</span></p>

Schedule 2</div> <!-- schedule -->

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
TRANSFER OF FUNCTIONS UNDER SUBORDINATE LEGISLATION</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That this schedule be the Second schedule to the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am amazed by the Government's conduct in the Committee. It is clear that they do not think it necessary to answer questions as they can use their vast majority to steamroller Parliament. I do not know why they bother with Parliament. Perhaps we shall reach a point when they decide not to do so.<br><br>
It is extraordinary that the Minister has nothing to say to introduce the schedule. I was respecting the conventions. You know me, Mr. McWilliam. I believe in parliamentary courtesies and conventions. It was my intention to let the Minister speak first to his own schedule, rather than to pre-empt him by getting my remarks in first. That was the origin of the confusion after which you kindly—I hope all members of the Committee will think rightly—allowed me, nevertheless, to speak, despite my momentary hesitation. I assure you, Mr. McWilliam, that I shall not hesitate again. Equally, I shall ask questions without expecting an answer from the Minister. We are in a new ball game. It is not Parliament as I knew it or as my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale, who studied political science, knows it. It is very worrying.<br><br>
As the Minister is no longer prepared to defend the Bill and does not answer questions, one wonders what the public who follow these matters, as I hope they do, will think. If the Minister refuses to answer questions here, he will certainly manage to avoid answering questions from the public or the press, as that is much easier, and there will be no illusions about how things are going.<br><br>
I want to ask a number of questions. The Minister might as well get on with this ministerial correspondence. He has no intention of answering my questions because the answers would no doubt be embarrassing to the Government. I shall try to do my job as the Opposition spokesman, even if the Minister is not doing his job of defending his Bill.<br><br>
I shall start with the beginning of schedule 2. We have already transferred in schedule 1 a large number of the functions that are created for the Secretary of State for Social Security as a result of primary legislation. We are now transferring the functions in secondary legislation. Some 20 pieces of secondary legislation are listed in the schedule, many of which involve more than one regulation, so the total is probably nearer 50, yet the Minister had nothing at all to say about that, which is an amazing commentary on British democracy in 1999. he hoped that he could say nothing, a Division would be called and the Government's majority would allow the provision to go through with no scrutiny and no questions. That is frightening.<br><br>
Some hysterical comments have been made recently, of which I do not approve, on the relationship between new Labour and past totalitarian Administrations, but the reality is worrying. It results from new Labour's corruption by the intoxication of its spin doctoring and its success at manipulating the message. The Government
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
believe that they can get away with anything because no one knows the meaning or substance. All political parties should try to resist the intoxication that comes with an enormous majority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have two points to make. First, I invite the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the word "corruption", because the honour of any Member of the House must not be impugned. Secondly, it was ruled long ago by a previous Speaker that no Member of the House, whatever the evidence to the contrary, can be intoxicated. I invite the hon. Gentleman to speak to the schedule.</span></p>
<p>12.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was using the word, "intoxicated" in a purely metaphorical sense and the word "corruption" in a philosophical sense. As always, Mr. McWilliam, I shall observe your guidance and speak strictly to the detail of the schedule.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Whether the hon. Gentleman was being philosophical or not, I invite him to withdraw his comments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall, of course, withdraw both comments.<br><br>
The schedule is complicated. The first item refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"All the regulations except regulations 36 to 39, 41 to 42 and 44."</p></blockquote>
We know that the object of the schedule is, in principle, to transfer Department of Social Security functions to the Inland Revenue. We strongly disapprove of that principle, but I shall not go into the general arguments now.<br><br>
One or two regulations and functions have mysteriously been left behind. I do not understand the logic of that. For example, regulations 37 and 38 of the Social Security (Contributions) Regulations 1979 are omitted in the schedule. They deal with the re-allocation of benefits and late contributions. Regulation 40, which is left in the schedule, deals with late class 2 contributions—voluntary contributions made by the self-employed. There is no logic in that.<br><br>
The same applies later in the schedule, in lines 32 and 39, which refer to regulations covering pensions. All are transferred except one or two, which are left in. We cannot accept that with no word of explanation from the Government. It is a shocking discourtesy. It is also very suspicious that the Government want to nod the schedule through without explaining to the public the logic of the apparent anomalies. If there is some logic, surely Parliament is entitled to know what it is.<br><br>
The Government should not wait for me, a Conservative spokesman, to put the matter on the record. I do not suppose we shall receive an answer because the Government are not in the business of answering questions in Parliament. Nevertheless, what we have witnessed this morning is deeply shocking. I make that point seriously and with no element of hyperbole. I should say to the Minister that this is an extraordinary way to conduct a Standing Committee. I hope that this conscience troubles him in the hours and weeks to come and that he realises that this is not the way to conduct his parliamentary career, whether from the Front Bench or elsewhere.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0302">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 35</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Collins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the questions raised by my hon. Friend can indeed be answered by the Department or by reference to the Minister's briefing pack, it seems curious that the Minister is not prepared to share that information. Alternatively, if that information has not been properly prepared, those who will provide claimants with legal advice, and the Contributions Agency and Inland Revenue officials who will implement the regulations, will be unable to act on the basis of proper and clear advice. In that case, the legislation might prove unenforceable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is saying bluntly that the Government are behaving in either a shifty or an inefficient fashion and I, too, can draw no other conclusion.<br><br>
The Minister should have explained to Parliament the rationale—if there is one to explain—for decisions on what will and will not go to the Treasury and the Inland Revenue, even though, as we have discovered, those powers will be exercised under the Treasury's direction. Had he done so, I could have probed any gaps that his explanation might have left and answered any questions that it might have raised. Opposition and, indeed, Government Committee members could also have asked sensible questions because the system would have been working properly. The Minister's response would have won or lost the argument, irrespective of the outcome of the vote. That difference is an important aspect of the system. In the House of Commons, winning arguments makes a lot of difference—it is not just a question of winning votes. The Minister needs to be told that, because the new Labour philosophy is that one can advance whatever rubbish one likes because the vote will always be won.<br><br>
That is not how Parliament should work. Indeed, if it continues to work in that way, people will begin to question the point in having a Parliament. Instead, one might as well have an elected dictatorship. Once every five years the winner of the general election could programme a computer, which would spew out the desired legislation of the Government of the day at the push of a button by their Prime Minister or Chief Whip. That would dispense with the need to spend time bringing people together in this place. What would be the point in allowing the press and public to come here, or in spending public funds on publishing the <i>Hansard</i> account of the House's proceedings?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Because of his persistent irrelevance, from which he must desist, I am showing the hon. Gentleman a grey card, although metaphorically it is yellow.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have perhaps anticipated a little what may happen next. I have asked questions which I believe you, Mr. McWilliam, will agree are entirely in order. You will also agree that it would be in order and, indeed, in the best traditions of the House that they should be answered seriously. I hope that I retain the right to catch your eye
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
again if the Minister's responses are in any way inadequate. I shall now sit down in the hope that the Minister will respond.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For the record, I have fully answered all the points of substance—of which there have not been many—that Opposition Members have raised.<br><br>
Where necessary, the schedule will transfer responsibilities from the Secretary of State to the Inland Revenue to effect the provisions in the Bill. The contributions regulations that will not be transferred are those relating to benefits, rather than to contributions. The understanding that the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford displayed of the Social Security (Contributions) Regulations 1979 was therefore defective. The benefit functions will not be transferred but will be retained by the Department of Social Security.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have not heard the rationale for retaining statutory sick pay and maternity pay, for example, in the hands of the Department of Social Security. Why retain those benefits rather than others? Has consideration been given to merging the whole of the Department of Social Security with the Treasury to make it part of the Treasury or Inland Revenue? Given that the Benefits Agency, which is responsible for handling out the money, is a separate next-steps agency, perhaps it too could report to the Treasury. There are so many anomalies that it makes little sense to continue with a separate Department of Social Security.</span></p>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 2, together with schedule 3 which it introduces, is a central plank of the Bill. It transfers policy responsibility for national insurance contributions to the Treasury and Inland Revenue, and responsibility to control the management of the national insurance fund to the Inland Revenue. The policy functions are set out in schedule 3.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0303">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 37</span>
Hon. Members may wonder why some functions are transferred to the Revenue and others—in fact, most—are transferred to the Treasury. We have replicated the split in tax law where day-to-day matters are the responsibility of the Inland Revenue and powers to affect tax liability are reserved to the Treasury. Although the clause and schedule 3 shift items to the Inland Revenue, they are principally concerned with the day-to-day running of the national insurance fund.<br><br>
The move to transfer policy responsibility for national insurance contributions to the Treasury and Inland Revenue have been widely welcomed. For example, in its representation in advance of the coming Budget, the Institute of Directors said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We welcome the transfer of the Contributions Agency to the Inland Revenue and the planned transfer of national insurance policy to the Revenue. The policy transfer is essential: without it the Contributions Agency transfer will deliver only a small fraction of its potential benefits because the Revenue will still have to apply two sets of policies based on different principles."</p></blockquote>
At the outset of our proceedings, the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford declared an interest on behalf of the Chartered Institute of Taxation. I do not know whether it took his advice before it submitted representations on the 1999 Budget, but he may be interested to know that it said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We are pleased to note that the Inland Revenue and the Contributions Agency are to merge their field forces. However, we regard this as being the first step towards the integration of the policies of the two Departments."</p></blockquote>
That view is sensible and proper.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it was a good thing that I declared my interest in the Chartered Institute of Taxation. I had no idea that it was going to be mentioned and I do not recall being consulted by it on that matter. Had it consulted me, I would have given it what was known in my City days as best advice. It would not have been obliged to take it, nor would my relationship with it alter my judgment of what is in the public interest. Perhaps I should have declared a negative interest. There is no skin off anyone's nose if the views of the Chartered Institute of Taxation are opposed to mine on this subject. We all have to do what we think is right.<br><br>
It would be churlish not to thank the Minister for giving the Committee the courtesy of an explanation, albeit brief, of why he is introducing the schedule. He did not go into great detail on the hesitation surrounding the transfer of the policy functions. The decision was taken by his boss, the Secretary of State for Social Security—the Minister will correct me if I am wrong—during or immediately before the Second Reading debate. Therefore, to some extent, the decision was sprung on the House. That relates to my hon. Friend's point—on which I intervened in his support—about the nasty sub-plot to the tragic drama of the surreptitious and deadly attack on the national insurance system. Ministers in the DSS may be so worried about their conduct of the Department's business over the past two years, and especially the shambles of the national insurance records system computer, that they may want to get shot of it as soon as possible.<br><br>

My first point about the clause is that it repeats the approach of schedule 1 and spectacularly proclaims the humiliation of the DSS. Even where the DSS has some remaining functions, it is merely the executive arm of the Treasury or the Revenue.<br><br>
Secondly—despite the Government's claim that the Bill is a minor administrative measure—it introduces through a schedule an enormous number of legislative changes that, had I not protested, I fear the Government would not have explained. Legislation affected will include the Social Security Act 1986, the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988—the main taxes Act as we refer to it—the Pension Schemes Act 1993, the Jobseekers Act 1995, and statutory sick pay legislation. All those measures will be changed at a stroke without individual discussion—as you would acknowledge, Mr. McWilliam, it was difficult to obtain agreement to even a brief discussion of the aggregate changes.<br><br>
It is a frightening aspect of the modern world. I acknowledged that Conservative Governments did not have clean hands in that regard—a tendency towards having more secondary legislation and less parliamentary scrutiny has been a feature of the past generation. I think you have heard me say before, Mr. McWilliam, under your chairmanship of Committees on statutory instruments, that the way in which secondary legislation is reviewed is profoundly wrong. It barely deserves to be described as legislation—it might better be referred to as a diktat or "ukase".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Collins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is making a powerful case on the inappropriate nature of the measure. Does he agree that, whatever the general merits or otherwise of transfers of regulatory powers under secondary legislation, it is difficult to defend the transfer of policy-making functions and that is difficult to reconcile with the principle of ministerial accountability to the House of Commons for policy formulation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes two powerful points, one of which I shall follow up in a moment.<br><br>
Momentous changes are being made—we have made that absolutely clear this morning—behind a screen of minor administrative change. I must say to my hon. Friend that I would expect hon. Members on both sides of the Committee—and perhaps Labour Members in particular—to be suspicious when a Minster comes to the Committee to defend a measure involving national insurance by virtue of a quotation from the Institute of Directors. Extraordinary things are happening when the Labour Government regard the Institute of Directors as the body that is most concerned about preserving the national insurance system, and when the best they can do to support their proposals is to pray in aid the Institute of Directors. The whole country, both the Opposition and the Labour party, are right to be doubly vigilant in those circumstances.<br><br>
Two important questions arise from the schedule—not detailed, nitpicking questions. The first—my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale touched on this—is the question of parliamentary accountability and responsibility.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. May I help the hon. Gentleman? At the moment, we are discussing clause stand part, but the hon. Gentleman's point arises from schedule 3, to which the clause gives effect. The clause does nothing else, so if the hon. Gentleman wishes to persist with his arguments, will he please do so when we debate schedule 3? Otherwise, we may have a very general debate about why we should not give effect to the schedule.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand entirely, Mr. McWilliam. Of course, that dilemma is frequently faced in the House.<br><br>
Because we are so dissatisfied, we shall vote against the clause, but it would be more logical to be able to set out our arguments as to why we find the schedule, to which the clause will give effect, obnoxious, before voting against giving it effect. I suppose that if we win the vote on clause 2, we shall no longer be able to talk about the schedule; but then we shall be so pleased about having destroyed the schedule that we will not complain about not having the opportunity to reveal the perniciousness of the Government's intentions as represented in it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon Gentleman has answered his own question about why we conduct the debate in that way. That is why it is so constructive.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the light of your guidance, Mr. McWilliam, I shall cease to comment on the matter. I trust that other Committee members will have the opportunity to catch your eye, if they so wish, during the clause stand part debate. I may revert to some of those points during the stand part debate in relation to the schedule if we are defeated in the vote on the clause. However, it would be nice to think that the arguments that my hon. Friend and I have adduced have been sufficiently persuasive to convince the majority of Labour Members to vote against the clause, and thereby to spare the embarrassment of the Minister, should he have to defend the schedule.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Collins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to take this opportunity to pose a question to the Minister about something that the said during the clause stand part debate. He said that the Government thought that there was merit in merging policy relating to national insurance and taxation. I should like a simple answer to the question of whether he believes that there is merit in merging the tax and national insurance systems throughout the income scale.</span></p>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That this Schedule be the Third Schedule to the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, we have the same try-on by the Government, who do not want to debate the schedule. Let there be no doubt about it—it will be evident in the <i>Official Report</i>—the Government do not want to debate these schedules. They have been trying to use their majority to steamroller them through. That is becoming a hallmark of the Government's conduct in the Committee, which is disgraceful.<br><br>
We have just seen the third occasion—we have discussed only two clauses—on which the Government refused to answer a question. My hon. Friend asked a clear question: what is the logic of transferring the policy functions from the Department of Social Security and not transferring the Department altogether? That is a pertinent question central to the Bill. The only excuse that the Minister might have, which I would accept if he chooses to use it, for not giving us an answer is that he hoped to win the vote on the clause and intended to use the debate on the schedule. The trouble was that had I not jumped up when I did, there would not have been a debate on the schedule.<br><br>
The Minister did not use the opportunity to explain the rationale of the schedule. He does not want to use the opportunity in the Committee to explain the rationale of the Bill as a whole. Perhaps one of the eager beavers on the Labour Back Benches who wants to earn some brownie points with the Whips will jump up and tell me if there is any other explanation for the Government declining to take the opportunity to explain the rationale of a Bill in Committee when the purpose of the Committee is to explain the rationale of each clause and schedule of that Bill. Either there is no rationale or the Government are ashamed to explain it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Collins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the Minister's extraordinary failure to answer my question, which clearly arose from his earlier comments on clause 2 stand part, creates uncertainty for many taxpayers and employers? The Minister will not say whether the Government plan to integrate the tax and national insurance system all the way up the income scale, and people who plan their own tax affairs and those of their employees will be uncertain, confused and worried at the Minister's persistent failure to answer straightforward questions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Hon. Members may or may not be happy with the Minister's responses, but I shall assist the hon. Gentleman by saying that the debate on the sittings motion is the customary broad debate that reflects the Bill's Second Reading. That was the only time when the rationale of the Bill could be debated in Standing Committee. Once we come to the clause by clause, line

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 41</span>
by line debate, we are discussing the details of the Bill. That is the procedure in Standing Committee and I am forced to insist that the Committee proceed in that way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course, that is how the Committee should proceed. The initial sittings motion is when general points can be made, but we could not have anticipated then that the Government would not use the opportunity of debate on individual clauses and schedules to explain the rationale of those clauses and schedules—the detailed provisions. You will accept, Mr. McWilliams, that I have been asking specific questions about the rationale of individual clauses and have received no response.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. May I assist the hon. Member by saying that the Chair is tied by Standing Orders? If the hon. Gentleman is dissatisfied and wants to revisit the thrust of the Bill and its policy, he may do so on Third Reading. That is now the only stage at which he may do that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is how the system should work and we can already anticipate some general comments that must be made on Third Reading about the Government's conduct in the Committee.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 42</span>
I said that I could see no reason for the Government to decline to explain the rationale of a clause, or a schedule that is allowed by a clause, unless they are ashamed of that rationale or there is no rationale. I shall try again, because it is our duty not to give up. I shall ask a number of questions and we shall see what answers we get.<br><br>
My first question was anticipated by my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale on clause 2 and refers to schedule 3. What is the rationale for taking the policy functions away from the Department of Social Security? Most of us had a clear image of the Department of Social Security as a Department in Whitehall—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before I adjourn the Committee, may I inform the Committee that the Room will be locked so hon. Members may safely leave papers here.<br><br>
With reference to the point made by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford this morning, I am assured that the area below the aisle will be roped off so that members of the public can see and hear what is happening.</span></p>
<p><i>It being One o'clock,</i> THE CHAIRMAN <i>adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.</i></p>
