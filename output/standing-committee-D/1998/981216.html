	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Calum Macdonald)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move.
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Town and Country Planning Planning (Minerals) (Scotland) Regulations 1998 (S.I., 1998, No. 2913).</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:With this it will be convenient to consider the draft Town and Country Planning (Compensation for Restrictions on Mineral Working and Mineral Waste Depositing) (Scotland) Regulations 1998 (S.I., 1998, No. 2914).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall set out as briefly as I can the effect of the two new sets of regulations, both of which relate to minerals development. Equivalent regulations are already in force in England and Wales and those that we shall discuss today are designed to update existing regulations in Scotland to bring them into line with the position in England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, on the Town and Country Planning (Minerals) (Scotland) Regulations 1998, statute has long recognised that minerals development is different from other types of development. Successive planning Acts have contained a power enabling regulations to be made that modify provisions in primary planning legislation relating to the development of minerals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997 contains several provisions that apply to developments involving the use of land or apply exclusively to operational development. The nature of mineral development is such that it does not fit exclusively into either category. While the winning and working of minerals is regarded as operational development, the depositing of mineral waste is regarded as a use of land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the regulations is to prescribe how the relevant provisions of the 1997 Act relating to use of land apply to mining operations. They update the statutory references in the 1971 regulations and repeal, by omission, those provisions that are now redundant. With one exception, the regulations do not contain a substantive change in policy or effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The exception is the repeal of regulation 5 of the 1971 regulations, which provided, in relation to mining operations, that an enforcement notice for breach of planning conditions or limitations could be served within four years of such a breach coming to the notice of the planning authority. The repeal of regulation 5 means that enforcement action can be taken at any point up to four years after the operations were substantially completed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
In other words, it means that time limits for enforcement action in respect of a breach of planning control set out in section 124 of the 1997 Act will now apply unmodified to minerals development. That is also consistent with the principle of the arrangements in section 74 of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997, which makes provision for the periodic review of all old mineral planning permissions. I hope that that is clear to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Town and Country Planning (Compensation for Restrictions on Mineral Working and Mineral Waste Depositing) (Scotland) Regulations 1998, update, replace and simplify the existing regulations that date from 1987. They update the compensation arrangements that apply when a planning authority exercises its powers to revoke, modify, suspend, prohibit or discontinue mineral working. Such an update is necessary because the arrangements in the existing 1987 regulations are inconsistent with those that apply under the scheme that was introduced originally by the Environment Act 1995 for the periodic review and updating of old mineral permissions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All modern mineral permissions have operating and restoration conditions attached to them, to ensure that operators meet modern environmental standards. Most old permissions have inadequate operating and restoration conditions. The 1995 Act required mineral permissions to be reviewed and updated periodically and provided for compensation to be paid to owners and operators only when new conditions, other than restoration and aftercare conditions, restrict working rights, which ensures a level playing field between old and new permissions. However, periodic reviews take place only every 15 years and planning authorities may need to use their existing order-making powers to take action in urgent cases between statutory reviews.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The current, 1987, compensation regulations provide for compensation to be paid when an order modifies an existing planning condition, although the amount of compensation can be abated in certain circumstances. In other words, the new regulations will ensure that compensation entitlements following orders are consistent with those applicable at the time of periodic reviews as introduced in the 1995 Act and, as such, are consistent with the existing statutory framework and do not introduce further policy change. I apologise to the Committee for the dryness and technical detail of the regulations, but that is the nature of the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will be delighted to learn that both sets of regulations have received the Treasury's consent. They have been the subject of consultation with all who have an interest in Scotland and there was widespread support for their effect. I commend both sets of regulations to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.36 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Letwin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister and I have now experienced several occasions on which, between us, we have not needed to detain a Committee for long. I commend his Department on its extreme economy by ensuring that he said almost verbatim the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0376">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
same as the noble Lord Macdonald of Tradeston said in the other place, who with equal eloquence explained equally clearly regulations that have little to be said against them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Contrary to my practice on the previous three occasions, I should like to ask one question. From what the Minister and the noble Lord said, I understand that the repeal of regulation 5 of the 1971 regulations will mean that certain action can be taken after work is complete. Will the Minister assure me that the regulations do not contain an element of retrospectivity, which would be worrying? I understood the Minister to say that that was in line with measures that are already in place under other legislation and that it applies in Scotland as well as in England and Wales. Therefore, I suspect that there is nothing to worry about, but it would be helpful to know why doing something after work has ended does not constitute a form of retrospectivity that should worry us. Provided the Minister can assure us about that, and barring my hon. Friends' raising some learned point to which we should attend, I see nothing objectionable about the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.38 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Gorrie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin), I received a briefing from the Library from a professor at the university of Dundee—so it must be right—saying that the regulations are good. I have two questions, which no doubt illustrate my ignorance rather than anything else. First, at two points in the regulations, the figure £8,110 appears, for which there must be some basis. It seems to be a magical figure, which is used as the basis for compensation. Does it need updating, or downdating?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the regulations contain the sensible suggestion that the claimant must prove that he cannot use plant and materials if he is to claim loss. Mineral extractors are pretty wily people, who will extract money out of the Government if they can. In the likely event of a dispute between them and the Government, who will decide whether such equipment has been or could be used elsewhere?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.38 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Viggers 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gosport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of strategic principle, when I was a Minister, responsible for, among other things, energy and mineral extraction in Northern Ireland, I had considerable flexibility and individual responsibility, which enabled me to change the terms on which we licensed minerals for extraction in Northern Ireland. We were trying to encourage companies to get involved in oil and gas exploration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
How will the powers that are currently entrusted to Ministers vary throughout the United Kingdom? If Scotland is to have a measure of independence and Wales is to have some devolution, and if those countries' powers are to be comparable with the measure of independent power that exists in Northern Ireland, it will be interesting to know how the powers will vary in different parts of the United Kingdom—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I apologise for the noise from below, where a children's party is going on?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.40 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that we would rather be there than here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful for the points that members of the Committee have raised. There is no element of retrospection in the regulations. A four-year allowance period already exists; we have simply shifted the date that triggers it to four years after substantial completion. That brings minerals developments into line with other developments and provides for a uniform approach, which simplifies matters and creates an easier approach to operating the regulations by planning authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A question was asked about the figure of £8,100. I cannot tell the Committee how the original figure was calculated. The sum is currently £5,000; £8,100 brings it into line with the gross domestic product inflator. Perhaps the matter can be pursued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Lands Tribunal for Scotland handles disputes. It will determine the amount of compensation that is payable if there is a dispute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Gosport (Mr. Viggers) mentioned Northern Ireland and I can assure him that there will be similar devolution of planning powers over minerals development in Scotland. Those powers will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
