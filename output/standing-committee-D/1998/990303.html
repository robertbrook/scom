	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Ms Glenda Jackson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Local Government Finance (England) Special Grant Report (No. 41).</p></blockquote>
I welcome the debate on the Special Grant Report (No. 41), which is about our proposals to pay grant to certain schemes put forward by particular local authorities under our rural bus challenge competition. The Committee will know that the Chancellor announced in last year's Budget an additional £50 million a year for rural public transport in the United Kingdom. The grants that we shall be discussing today are part of that £50 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This new money is one of the positive steps that the Government are taking to assist rural communities, improve mobility, provide more travel choice for people who live in the countryside and reduce rural isolation, a particular form of social exclusion. Car ownership is higher in rural areas than in towns, but access to jobs, shops, schools, entertainment and hospitals is more restricted for people without a car. Public transport, particularly the rural bus with its flexibility and adaptability, can help to remove those restrictions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The £50 million a year announced in the last Budget showed the Government's commitment to rural public transport, particularly in the rural bus. It is helping rural communities to flourish, providing alternatives to the private car and protecting the environment. That £50 million is an annual total for the whole of the United Kingdom. It is divided among the four nations by the well-established Barnett formula. The English share is £41.7 million, £32.5 million of which has already been distributed to local authorities via the new rural bus subsidy grant that is set out for the current financial year in the Special Grant Report (No. 36) that was approved by the House last July. Local authorities have used that money for new services that provide new travel opportunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, £4.2 million has been made available for community-based initiatives in rural areas and £5 million was set aside for a rural bus challenge competition, the results of which are set out in the Special Grant Report (No. 41).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In July, we announced our plans to hold a challenge competition. Local authorities were invited to put forward innovative schemes and we made it clear that bids could be for capital as well as for current account expenditure. We also stressed several important
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
factors to be taken into account in developing proposals, such as the need to consider public transport networks, improve links between remote rural areas and existing public transport services, consider the needs of women and people with disabilities and take account of interaction with community transport providers as well as bus operators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bids were invited from county and unitary councils, and passenger transport authorities in August last year. By the closing date in October, we had received a total of 214 bids from 54 authorities. The total value of the bids was more than £41.5 million. I was particularly impressed that so many local authorities worked so quickly and effectively to produce so many worthwhile bids.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The timing of the Budget announcement last year, plus the need to develop criteria and consult on proposals for the new rural bus subsidy grant, meant that in the first year authorities have not been able to spend the full £32.5 million that is available to them. We have added a further £6.5 million to the initial £5 million, enabling us to fund even more worthy schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even with that increase, total bids far exceeded the £11.4 million that was available. There were many disappointed authorities, but there will be at least two more challenge competitions for bids to be considered. In reaching decisions on this year's challenge, we examined the schemes against the published criteria with the greatest care. We aimed at a balanced range of schemes—large and small, simple and technically more advanced—from all over the country. Time does not permit me to list all the schemes supported, but I expect that the Committee will want me to mention at least some of the successful bids.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Durham will receive £592,000 for a scheme that aims to improve public transport access for coalfield communities, where the need for good links with other centres can be acute. Partnerships will be developed with bus operators to improve information and waiting facilities, and to extend the Access bus to serve former mining villages. The scheme will also involve the establishment of a hire-care or taxi-bus service to improve access to areas with employment opportunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Norfolk is to receive £444,500 for its Norfolk coast strategy, which aims to provide new services and new shelters, and provide for the installation of public information terminals at principal tourist information centres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Wiltshire, we are supporting a £463,000 scheme for the evocatively named Wiltshire Wigglybus—three new bus services providing a flexibility routed service for rural communities in Pewsey Vale between Devizes and Burbage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Somerset will receive £130,000 for the Mendips flexible bus project, which will provide a dedicated vehicle and driver for peak-time services linking villages in the Mendips to the commercial network for journeys to Bath, Bristol and Frome, and flexibly routed off-peak services, including evening services, to Midsommer Norton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0301">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
In Nottinghamshire, £1.15 million will go to the Worksop area for a real-time information and mobility management system based on satellite tracking, and for a smartcard ticketing system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Peterborough, we are giving £74,000 for a rural taxi-bus service that will provide links between the main railway station and the surrounding area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For Gloucestershire, £25,000 will be given for a scheme to provide a rural transport brokerage, which will make full use of ambulances and other council vehicles to provide public transport services when not otherwise in use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall outline the other contents of the report. Annex A lists the amounts payable to each of the 33 successful authorities for the 46 schemes approved. The total cost of those schemes is £11,418,694—more than double the £5 million initially allocated to the challenge competition. The report seeks approval for the total cost of the schemes. Some of the schemes listed will last one year, others will last longer. The funding figures shown are the total scheme costs and not necessarily the annual costs. It seems only right to place before the Committee the full costs for which the Government seek approval.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Annex B details the main features of the report, including an explanation of the objectives of the competition and the criteria against which the bids were assessed, including the extent to which the bids took account of the key factors highlighted in the bidding invitation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The conditions and arrangements for payment are set out in annex C. Any costs to be incurred this year will be paid immediately. Costs for future years that exceed £25,000 will be paid in instalments upon receipt of a statement from the authority of what it spent the previous year and what is projected for future years, as a simple matter of financial propriety. Similarly, at the end of each scheme, the authorities must provide an audit certificate showing that the funds have been used in accordance with the purpose for which they were paid, and a statement setting out the extent to which the aims and benefits of the schemes have been achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have explained the key features of the report. It demonstrates the importance that the Government attach to rural communities and the transport opportunities available to them. It shows that we are determined, as part of an integrated transport policy, to make sure that people have transport options other than the private car. It shows also that the Government are thinking of those who cannot afford a private car but who still have transport needs and who deserve to be brought into the wider community of work and leisure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The special grants that are the subject of the report represent a variety of bright, innovative ideas by local authorities to improve rural bus transport. I am sure that they will prove their worth in years to come and that they will encourage others to adopt similar ideas. I commend the report to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
	<p>4.40 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bernard Jenkin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Essex)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Cunningham. It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair once again. We have served together on Committees. I hope that we shall not keep you too long this afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Minister's objective, which we share, of promoting community-based transport and public transport in rural areas so that those without cars have the opportunity to move around. I give the scheme and the grants a qualified welcome, because they challenge the idea of what a bus service is. We must move on from the idea that a bus has a fixed timetable, stops at a fixed place, has many seats and trundles, largely empty, around the countryside. Schemes need to be much more demand related; they must be sensitive to people's needs. Community transport and schemes such as dial-a-ride have challenged the conventional thinking on what bus services should be like in sparsely populated areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had hoped that the Minister would welcome what Essex county council has done under the scheme. Its grant is one of the largest that she has given, so she obviously thinks that what the Conservatives on Essex county council have achieved is worth while. I hope that she will forgive me for crowing about that a little. The council is introducing a flexible bus network for the Dengie peninsula. It is not simply a bus; it is a bookable bus, without a fixed timetable. People telephone to find out where it will be and when, and to give instructions about when it should arrive at which place. It is a cross between a bus and a taxi service. People are given real-time information, which is much more relevant; it is not like services that have timetables pinned to bus stops. People want to know where buses are and when they will arrive. Conventional bus services tend not to meet those needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now introduce my first note of criticism. The £50 million contribution to rural bus transport which the Government are proud to serenade as the greatest thing since the invention of sliced bread, is a little over-hyped. It is dwarfed by what the Government have removed from rural areas under the changes to the area cost adjustment. 	<i>(Interruption.]</i> Labour Members do not like the truth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the county councils network has explained, the changes to the area cost adjustment removed far more than £50 million a year from rural areas. Although it is comforting that some of that money will be given back, it is a shame that the Government are taking away far more from rural areas than they are giving back under this or any other scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The timing of such announcements is important. This money is for payment largely in this financial year, but the bid particulars and the guidance were issued well into the financial year. Of course, that is not down to the Minister personally; the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced the scheme at the beginning of the financial year. However, she knows that that has caused many difficulties in local authorities. Some
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0302">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
local authorities thought that, if they were to keep their part of the original £50 million, they had to spend the grant as quickly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Norfolk, for example, there are new bus services, which no one knows about, and the buses are running around the countryside largely empty, because sufficient preparation was not done before money was committed to the schemes. In my county of Essex the council has delayed implementation to ensure that the money is spent on services that people need, but they have effectively forgone the revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So when the Minister says that the Government have, very generously, added to the £5 million, she means that some of the money allocated to local authorities so late that they could not spend it has been added to the amount. I am pleased that that has not been clawed back by the Treasury. The Minister is to be congratulated because her Department is not usually so successful with the Treasury negotiations. Overall Government spending on transport is declining under this Administration. Not many Labour Members probably realise that, but if they look at the Red Book, they will see that transport spending is falling in real terms. The Minister shakes her head. Will she give us the figures?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I presume that the hon. Gentleman is referring to the reduction in subsidy for surface rail that will be paid to train operating companies as a result of contracts that were agreed by his Government during rail privatisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It also has quite a lot to do with the massive cuts in the roads programme. Public investment in public transport is falling, as the Minister has just confirmed to the Committee. Again she shakes her head.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman refers to cuts in the roads programme. In the announcement poster on the roads review, the Government committed themselves to far more road schemes—real schemes that are funded and which will be started and finished, rather than the fantasy productions of the previous Administration.—[Interruption.]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before I call the hon. Member for North Essex, I ask the Committee to return to the subject of buses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may clarify the point—because buses run on roads—the previous Government spent£1 billion a year on trunk road and motorway improvements, a figure that the Government have cut by nearly two thirds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have not made the special grant out of the kindness of their heart, but because of their incompetence and the haste with which the £50 million was allocated to local authorities. I ask the Minister for more continuity in the Government's proposals on rural buses. We want the money to be well spent. The precipitate, publicity-oriented way in which the Chancellor made the £50 million one of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
centrepieces of last year's Budget is not the best way to govern local authorities' transport expenditure. The scheme was announced in the last Budget, the rules were not issued until July, four months into the financial year, the deadline for bids was the end of October and the deadline for notification of the amounts was 16 December—yet the scheme has supposedly been running throughout this financial year. We want a more stable arrangement so that that does not happen again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister also explain the effect of inflation on the £50 million that the Government are to pay each year? Is that £50 million cash or is it to be adjusted for inflation or the revenue support grant each year? It makes a significant difference. By the third year, the compound rate of inflation could approach 10 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Allen (Vice-Chamberlain of Her Majesty's Household)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was in the old days.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It depends which measure one uses—the retail prices index or the amount by which the revenue support grant is adjusted. World inflation rates are very low and the Government are benefiting from that fact. The question of whether the figures are to be inflation-adjusted is significant. If the Department has done its work with the Treasury, they will be adjusted upwards for inflation each year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the issue of continuity, one reason why the Minister has extra money to play with in this round of financing, as opposed to the however many million pounds were allocated to local authority bus services, is that local authorities cannot spend the money as they would have liked on saving bus services which are being cut. The £50 million has not reversed the decline in rural bus services. The problem, which will be seriously tackled only be genuine innovation and fresh thinking, is that existing services, on which people depend, are being reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can give two examples from my constituency. The bus services running from Bures to Colchester and the Dedham to Colchester have both been cut. The local authority is not allowed to use any of this money—or, indeed, any other money allocated by the Government for rural bus services—to save those services, which would be of more benefit to the people of Essex than the introduction of new services, because people depend on existing services. People may depend on new services in future, but new services are not an existing lifeline like existing services. People who live in Dedham and work in Colchester but who do not have a car will have to make alternative arrangements or lose their jobs. Because of its inflexibility, the scheme will not achieve everything that the Government hope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, and topically, I ask the Minister to consider fuel duty, because a significant cost of such services is diesel fuel duty. Registered bus services obviously benefit from the bus fuel duty rebate, but that is a fixed percentage of the fuel duty. Each time the fuel duty is increased, the floor of the rebate is also increased, so the rebate remains a constant percentage of the duty. What the Chancellor giveth, the Chancellor taketh away. The Chancellor has given money to local
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0303">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

authorities to run such services, and is about to take some away in the Budget by increasing diesel duty. We now have by far the highest duty in Europe—more than double any in Europe. It is crucifying the road haulage sector, and needlessly adding to the costs of rural bus services. Moreover, it adds to the bus services—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The Government Whip keeps making comments; I should be happy to give way to him if he wants to intervene.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. As the hon. Member for North Essex has brought me to my feet, I should point out that an earlier sedentary intervention by the Government Whip was one factor which caused me to call the Committee to order previously. I realise that buses need roads, but neither that matter nor fuel duty are under consideration. I hope that hon. Members will give the hon. Member for North Essex the respect that he deserves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful, Mr. Cunningham. My point about fuel duty is that some of the money will return to the Treasury in the form of fuel duty, especially in the case of community transport schemes, which do not receive a bus fuel rebate. Will the Minister support the Bill promoted by my hon. Friend the Member for West Derbyshire (Mr. McLoughlin) to extend the bus fuel duty rebate to community transport schemes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.53 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Adrian Sanders 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Torbay)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following on from the remarks of the hon. Member for North Essex, which I do not want to repeat, transport problems in rural areas are complex and deeply felt. No member of the Committee would object to the approval of the sums under consideration. All hon. Members recognise the hard work of local authorities in the bidding process, and believe that the approved projects were almost certainly the best that were received. Nevertheless, it is important that money is allocated for rural transport services, because isolated rural areas cannot economically support bus services without sufficient numbers of people, and therefore depend on subsidy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the years, the reaction to that has been an increase in car ownership in rural areas. Studies have shown that the cars tend to be older, less fuel-efficient and more costly to run, but they are essential. Deprivation indices are examined when grants are given out, but no one thinks that someone who owns a car is deprived. Yet, in more extreme rural areas, such as parts of Cornwall and Devon, people are on very low incomes but there are high levels of car ownership. Because of such high levels of car ownership, low incomes and other deprivation factors are missed. Therefore, money towards subsidising alternatives to cars in such areas is very important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You had 214 applications for grant, but only 33 were recommended, which is 15 per cent. of the total. We are moving towards an era in government whereby matters are put out to competition and bidding processes have to be entered into. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
problem is that a great deal of time, energy and resources are tied up in such processes. If you costed the resources that were put into the 85 per cent.—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->: Order. The hon. Gentleman keeps using the word "you". It is not me but the Government who make the decisions.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sanders</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the costs of the bidding process were recognised, I am sure that one would conclude that it was far better to divide an equivalent amount of money among all the local authorities concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Government are keen on best value and ensuring that taxpayers' money is spent on the objectives set by the Government. That can be done through best value and other auditing procedures, so the top slicing of money for competition is not necessary. The hon. Member for North Essex was right to say that the amount of money spent on public transport is decreasing. Rural areas have lost massively because of the area cost adjustment changes, and the amount of money available is a fraction of what it was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fuel tax increases in last year's Budget brought in substantial amounts of money. If the fuel tax levies attributed to buses and other vehicles in rural areas could be costed, it would dwarf the amount of money that is available for the rural areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for mentioning that point. Some time ago, we had a debate on the Floor of the House about transport in rural areas. The Library gave me some interesting figures showing that the amounts of money are susbstantial. The amount of money taken out of rural areas by this Government are enormous, compared with the amount that they are handing over in a high-profile, high-publicity-conscious—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->: Order. The hon. Gentleman is making a speech when he should be asking a question.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sanders</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Member for North Essex.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the measure, but let us not for one moment think that it is either new money, additional money or an adequate amount for the task for which it is intended. It is little more than a publicity stunt, but it would be churlish to vote against it. I welcome the money, but the system and the bidding process are good publicity for the Government rather than an attempt to tackle the serious problem of the lack of transport in rural areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaun Woodward 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Witney)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome the principles behind the rural bus challenge. However, like many others, I share the disappointment that, although there were 240 bids, few people were actually given any money. Will the Minister shed some light on the background to the selection and tell the Committee whether an application was received from every authority? Did it include my county of Oxfordshire? Was an application received from Oxford county council? If so, what was the bid?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0304">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
Many people looking at the list will be pleased to see substantial sums being handed out. Undoubtedly, they will also feel that that is unfair on those who were not successful in their bids. Rural transport is extremely important in my constituency as 10 per cent. of the people who live in Oxfordshire do not have access to a car. I am sure that many of my constituents will be rather surprised if Oxfordshire county council put in a bid and was not successful. Perhaps the Minister can tell us whether the council was not innovative enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Laying out the criteria behind the decisions would add to the Government's claim that they want to be more transparent. Perhaps the Minister will even consider publishing a full list of all the applications and bids that she received. She could give us the criteria and tell us who took part in judging who should and who should not be successful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measure has its good points. One should not be churlish, but should congratulate those who got the money. I should like the Minister to reply to my specific questions because so few people have succeeded in their bids. The money is not a large amount in the overall scheme of Government money, but my constituents in Oxfordshire will have to pay extra fuel duty and taxes and will get nothing back. It is only fair that the people of Oxfordshire should understand more about the criteria used to deny the people who were not successful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.2 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Members for North Essex, for Torbay (Mr. Sanders) and for Witney (Mr. Woodward) began in their inimitable way by saying that they did not want to be churlish about competition, the rural bus challenge, or the rural bus subsidy allocations, and proceeded to be so churlish that I do not think they understand what we are talking about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing a rural bus challenge—an additional £11.4 million for which local authorities submitted bids. The criteria was clear and I shall read it out in a moment. To address the point made by the hon. Member for North Essex, that sum was in addition to the additional £50 million that the Chancellor of the Exchequer managed to find for rural bus subsidy grant. It is additional funding to local authorities. I have already told the Committee how the money was divided among the four nations. The money was over and above funds from central Government to local authorities across the whole United Kingdom for their usual year-on-year submission of their transport plans.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to be at cross-purposes with the Minister, but £11.4 million is being allocated. It was originally going to be £5 million. The English-Welsh portion of the £50 million that was initially circulated was not all allocated because of problems with local authorities making the necessary commitments within the financial year and in good time to use up the money. The Minister has recouped
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
that and has added it to this amount. Is not that correct? That is what I have been told by Essex county council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is totally incorrect. I am interested to hear that that is the information that has been submitted to the hon. Gentleman by his local authority. I shall write to his local authority at no little speed. I tell him again that the £50 million was an additional subsidy, paid specifically for rural bus services. It was divided between the four nations according to the Barnett principles, and the money allocated for England was divided equally between local authorities on the definition of rurality—which is those communities outside settlements with a population of 3,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All of the £50 million has been allocated. It is totally incorrect to say that the timing was inaccurate. Local authorities needed time to decide what new services could be provided for their rural communities, and contracts had to be submitted. The hon. Gentleman argued that the new money would have been infinitely better used on existing services, but that is absurd because bus operators might simply have pulled out of existing services and resubmitted higher contracts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that his constituency is losing some bus services, but that is also happening in other parts of the country. It is extremely difficult to say why. It is partly due to increased costs, especially as drivers' wages are going up, but there are various other reasons. However, we are discussing the additional funds that were made available to swell the rural bus challenge. Local authorities had examined the possibilities and decided how they could spend their share of the additional money that the Chancellor had managed to find, but it was clear that in some instances that money could not be spent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what I was saying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But the money was not lost to local authorities. We are talking about an additional £6 million. That is why we have been able to fund even more innovative local authority schemes. Again, it is a question of timing. Once local authorities had made their plans for the additional new services, they proceeded to make bids for the challenge competition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the point made by the hon. Member for Witney. I had already said that there would be many disappointed local authorities, but they will have the opportunity to make at least two more bids. My Department will write to the unsuccessful authorities, because we wish to help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am, of course, prepared to publish the entire list of successful and unsuccessful bids. Perhaps this is an opportune moment to refer to the specific criteria that I mentioned earlier. The criteria were that the new services should deal with the needs of women and people with disabilities, should build transport links with remote rural areas, and should enable better cooperation with community services. The actual criteria was published in the report. I am somewhat surprised that the hon. Gentleman did not read the report before entering the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0305">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodward</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's jest; I shall not dignify it with a response. The criteria laid down in annex B are a pretty poor way of defining why only 15 per cent. of those bids were successful. I specifically asked what were the criteria, because in my constituency there are women, people with impaired mobility and people with particular community transport problems—not least because of the Government's policy of closing community hospitals. I asked what were the specific criteria that led the Minister to choose one bid rather than another. I did not mean her to make the ludicrous suggestion that I had not read annex B.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has read the report, although I think that those who listened to his speech might have doubted it. He asked about specific and precise criteria for the challenge competition that was looking for innovative and original ideas. The hon. Gentleman's idea that it would be possible to define such criteria clearly is a contradiction in terms. I regret that so many authorities' bids were not successful, but that was because they did not meet the criteria and were not sufficiently innovative. Our objective is to ensure forms of transport for some of the most denied rural communities that have suffered not least because of the previous Administration's process of bus deregulation in the countryside. That led directly to serious isolation in many rural communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am talking about additional funding over and above the larger additional funding that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer specifically targeted for the introduction of new bus services in rural communities subsequent to the comprehensive spending review. I say to the hon. Member for Witney that Oxfordshire received from £926,906 from the rural bus subsidy grant allocation. As for the hon. Member for Torbay, I understand that Devon received £1,409,020 in bus subsidy grant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sanders</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is all well and good, but I am not speaking for Devon. I come from a unitary authority called Torbay, which is not covered by Devon county council. I mentioned Devon, as I know it well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister say how much money was lost in the area cost adjustment and how much revenue was raised from rural areas from the fuel tax increases last year? How does that compare with whichever figure that we wish to believe, whether it is her figure or that referred to by the hon. Member for North Essex—be it £61 million or £50 million plus £6 million?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman referred to the area cost adjustment because that is another canard popular with Opposition parties. It is grossly untrue that rural communities have suffered from the Government's standard spending assessment and revenue support grant. No local authority has received less this year than it received the year before. In many instances, authorities have received a great deal more because that is part and parcel of the Government's process of disseminating finances from
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
central Government to local authorities in an infinitely fairer way than it was dispersed over the benighted 18 years of the previous Administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Concern has been expressed about fuel duty rebate and the hon. Member for Torbay referred to it again. I can tell the Committee that 66 per cent. of fuel duty rebate goes back. Our approach to the rebate was much welcomed by the Confederation of the British Road Passenger Transport when it was announced in the last year's Budget. It was estimated by the confederation, whose members are bus operators and providers, that it meant between £30 million and £40 million to the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Essex referred also to fuel duty rebate and the fuel duty escalator. Clearly, his memory has failed him. The fuel duty escalator was introduced by the previous Administration and, indeed, it was mentioned earlier today at Prime Minister's Question Time. I could be misquoting but, when replying to a question about the escalator and this country's commitment to reducing greenhouse gases and the amount of CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> in the environment, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister quoted a previous Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer who said that, in the light of the Government's commitment to improving our environment, any Conservative Member who was critical of the fuel duty escalator would be sailing dangerously close to hypocrisy. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hear barracking from the hon. Member for North Essex. The hon. Gentleman raised the issue of fuel duty and roads, and the Minister is now responding. If I had stopped the hon. Gentleman and asked him to confine his remarks to the grant, he may have complained. I have given the hon. Gentleman a little bit of licence and he must accept that the Minister has answered him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady has sat down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's memory is a little faulty if she does not remember that, when we introduced the fuel duty rebate, fuel prices in this country were much less than those on the continent. They are now substantially more. Diesel is 35 per cent. cheaper on the continent. If the Government continue to make that disparity worse, they will reap the harvest of worse rural bus services and create problems for road haulage companies. Given the way that Labour Members carry on about deregulation, anyone would think that rural bus services were booming until deregulation and then went into precipitate decline. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Quite a debate has been generated by grants to local government for bus services. This is escalating into a major debate. The hon. Gentleman must keep his remarks to the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jenkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Cunningham, for that guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0306">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
Given that we are all concerned about the decline in rural transport—that is why the grants are being made—it does not help our understanding of the grants or the industry in general to caricature the problems as the Minister has done. In fact, rural bus services were in steep decline during the 1950s; during the 1960s, under Labour Governments; and during the 1970s, under Conservative and Labour Governments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Deregulation has succeeded in stemming that decline and in increasing the number of passenger miles. However, we all accept that it has not reversed the decline, so let us tackle the problem a little more calmly, instead of having to witness the paranoia that is becoming the hallmark of the Labour party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I want to press one point. The Minister made a great song and dance about my questioning her generosity. I do not want to question her generosity; I simply want to be absolutely clear that we agree. After all, annex B states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Ministers had decided to allocate an initial sum of £5 million to the support of successful bids, and to increase this sum by the total amount by which local authorities were forecast to underspend the amount made available in 1998–99 for rural bus subsidy."</p></blockquote>
Local authorities would not underspend if announcements were made and the consultation took place well in advance of the financial year. I know of the difficulty that the Minister had: this was one of those cases of Chancellors sticking to their Budgets to make them look good, and she had no time to issue guidance and all the other stuff earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us agree that, if such grants are made, it would be better if they were announced well in advance of the financial year in question. I am sure that the Minister would agree with that practical point. If all the issues could be settled in advance, local authorities would not underspend the money that they were allocated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the fact that the Minister has been able to reallocate and reuse the money. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I said in my opening remarks that I was pleased about that. However, it would be better if local authorities were able to plan effectively so that they did not bid for money which they could not use within the year in question. The Minister is getting very excited. Perhaps I can end on a friendly note: there are difficulties, and it is the Government's job to sort them out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.19 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall touch briefly on the fuel duty rebate, which is separate from the fuel escalator. As I have said, the previous Conservative Government
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
introduced the fuel escalator for reasons which we support in our battle to improve the environment of not only this country but the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am prepared to accept, in a spirit of co-operation, that I may have failed to explain them adequately to the hon. Gentleman, but he still seems grossly to have misunderstood the sums involved. As a result of the comprehensive spending review—under which transport did extremely well, with an additional £1.7 billion of public transport settlement and an additional £700 million for local authority transport—and of the Government's concern for and commitment to improving public transport in rural areas, the Chancellor announced an allocation of £50 million every year for the next three years for the direct provision of new services in rural communities. That figure is in addition to the sums that local authorities already obtain from central Government for rural public transport services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have given the definition of a rural community for the purposes of allocating the grant. There was no competition for it and it was divided, following the criteria, across the whole of England. The hon. Member for North Essex is concerned about timing; there was adequate time for local authorities to assess the situation within their rural communities and to make it clear to bus providers that they could make bids for contracts for the provision of new services. At the end of that process, there was—for a variety of reasons, which may not have anything to do with time—funding left over. That sum was added to the £5 million that had been earmarked for a separate, yet additional, funding scheme for the rural bus challenge competition. The money was kept in the area for which it was earmarked—rural bus provision—and was not siphoned back into what, under the previous Administration, would have been the black hole of the Treasury. The £50 million will be given year on year and there will be new opportunities for bids for the rural bus challenge competition over the next two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The additional funding is a clear measure of the Government's commitment to rural communities. We are taking major steps, not only in terms of policy but of financial provision, to mend the tattered communities and to set right the wrongs that resulted from 18 benighted years of Conservative Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
