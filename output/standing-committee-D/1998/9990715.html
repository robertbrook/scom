	<p>10 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Mr. Tony Lloyd)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><q><p>That the Committee has considered the draft International Copper Study Group (Legal Capacities) Order 1999.</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the draft International Organisations (Immunities and Privileges) Miscellaneous Provisions Order 1999 and the draft Intelsat (Immunities and Privileges) (Amendment) Order 1999.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give a brief explanation of the three draft orders. The first was laid before the House of Commons on 21 May. It confers the necessary legal capacity to fulfil our obligations under the terms of reference of the International Copper Study Group, which the Government provisionally accepted on 5 June 1998.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The study group is an intergovernmental organisation and was formed in 1989 under the auspices of the United Nations. There are currently 17 member states, including France, Germany, Italy and the European Union. The headquarters are in Lisbon, where the study group meets formally twice yearly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have responded, through the Department of Trade and Industry, to the promptings of the United Kingdom industry, which believes that there is enormous value in membership of the group. It provides market transparency and operates as the forum which brings the industry and Governments together. The United Kingdom is among the world's top 10 consumers of copper and it is important that we are members of the organisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Solihull)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In his preamble, the Minister told us that among the participating members of the study group were France, Germany, Italy and the European Union. He may wish to clarify that because France, Germany and Italy are members of the European Union. Is the same thing being said twice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The initiative for our membership came from our own industry, so the initiative is United Kingdom based. It was in response to the needs of and requests from the United Kingdom copper industry that we have accepted the desirability and logic of joining the study group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot tell the hon. Gentleman what logic prompted the European Union to join the study group, but I shall try to clarify that before I sit down. If that is not feasible, I shall write to the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
Membership of the study group will ensure that the United Kingdom copper industry is not disadvantaged by the activities of the study group. If we are not at the table, we shall have no influence on the future direction of the group, and that could prevent us from deflecting the group from areas that are disadvantageous to our industry. It is a useful vehicle for regular dialogue on a variety of issues affecting copper and I hope that the Committee will accept that our membership is sound and sensible. If hon. Members wish to raise other matters, I shall try to respond to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft International Organisations (Immunities and Privileges) Miscellaneous Provisions Order and the draft Intelsat (Immunities and Privileges) (Amendments) Order were laid before the House on 30 June and 2 July this year respectively and are similar. The miscellaneous provisions order provides for refunds of insurance premium tax and air passenger duty to 26 international organisations listed in the schedule to the order. The IPT and the APD were both introduced in 1994. The proposed refunds meet our international obligations, and are standard for the type of international organisation listed in the order. It is established international practice that a state does not tax other states through the intermediary of an international organisation, and that the host state does not derive undue fiscal advantage from the presence on its soil of an international organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The insurance premium tax is levied on buildings, on household contents and on vehicle insurance policies. Some areas of insurance, such as pensions and permanent health insurance, are exempt from the tax. Therefore, the impact of the order will be to exempt the international organisations from insurance tax on buildings and their contents, and on vehicle insurance policies. The order also includes minor amendments to some of the 26 orders that already exist, updating the names of organisations and the titles of their high officers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Intelsat order carries much the same impact for Intelsat as the miscellaneous provisions order does for other international organisations, in that it provides for refunds of insurance premium tax and of passenger duty. It also provides for relief from non-domestic rates and for exemption from United Kingdom social security provisions for members of its staff participating in Intelsat's social security scheme. That will not place its employees in jeopardy; it merely recognises the fact that as beneficiaries of the Intelsat scheme, they do not need to benefit from United Kingdom social security provisions. The order is necessary because of the location of Intelsat in the United Kingdom, itself a recent development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft orders also confer a number of internationally accepted privileges and immunities. We have included only those that are strictly necessary in order for us to conform with our international obligations. commend the three orders to the Committee, and I trust that they will gain the approval of all Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.7 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Cheryl Gillan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chesham and Amersham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Cunningham, and assure you that I do not intend to take up too much of the Committee's time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, following the Minister's fine introduction of the three orders, it would be remiss of me to let them slip through without any questions or comments from the Opposition side of the Committee. Secondary legislation can often slip through without being probed fully. The Minister may agree that that probably happened in many instances when he was a member of the Opposition under the previous Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am deeply disappointed at the suggestion that a great deal of secondary legislation slipped through unnoticed when I was a member of the Opposition. I trust that that was not a rebuke for my performance at that time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the cap fits, wear it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this country, most international organisations enjoy immunities and privileges by virtue of their being named in orders under the International Organisations Act 1968. The exceptions to that are the United Nations and the European Union, which enjoy immunities and privileges under separate legislation. However, from time to time there have to be new orders, either to confer immunities and privileges on new organisations or to modify existing arrangements. In this instance, the primary focus of the three orders is to exempt them from insurance premium tax and air passenger duty. My understanding is that immunities and privileges are granted to international organisations on a purely practical basis, to allow them to fulfil their functions. One of the purposes is to preserve the independence of action of those organisations, which should not be subject to any form of leverage by the host nation. However, I should like the Minister to answer my questions, which I ask in good faith.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The orders are made under existing primary legislation to remove taxes—the air passenger duty and the insurance premium tax, as the Minister outlined—which, I presume, will result in a substantial loss to the Exchequer. Will the Minister say how much IPT and APD—the Minister referred to refunds—will be repaid under the orders, and how much has been paid to date? What consideration was given to changing the primary legislation with regard to the two taxes? Are the two taxes especially critical to the independence of such organisations? Alternatively, was a decision taken to introduce a blanket exemption?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the reason for choosing the 26 plus two organisations? What other organisations were considered? Are organisations considered for this type of immunity and privilege on a regular basis? Why were organisations such as the Commonwealth Development Corporation, which we were discussing in the House last night, not included? That organisation would seem to operate in a similar sort of area as those organisations named in the substantive order. What consideration was given to the inclusion of certain international charities? The International Copper Study Group was picked out,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
but will the Minister tell the Committee what other study groups are provided with such immunity and privilege?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be comforting to the Committee to know that all of the organisations concerned are fully operational, fully recognised by other countries throughout the world, and regularly audited so as to provide accounting that is accessible by this Government and this country. We must ensure that, if special immunities and privileges are to be extended, all of the organisations that benefit are absolutely pukka.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to know why a Labour Government are granting immunities and privileges? Should we not all be equal before the law?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention, but it is for the Government to answer his question. I do not answer for them, and sometimes I wonder whether some Ministers—although the Minister in this Committee is an exception—do so. They never seem to provide answers when we ask them questions. However, I know that the hon. Gentleman will try to answer me. I should he delighted to allow him—subject to other Committee members wanting to ask questions—to provide answers to some of my questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.14 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Heath 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Somerton and Frome)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also welcome you to the chair, Mr. Cunningham, for what I hope will be a relatively brief sitting of the Committee. I agree with the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) that it is important properly to scrutinise such orders, however dry and dusty they may seem. We have a duty to ensure that they are properly constructed and correct in terms of their entry into British law. I have a few questions to ask but I associate myself with many of the comments that were made by the hon. Lady.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My concern with the orders, which I have expressed in previous delegated legislation Committees, relates to the piecemeal procedure that is involved. When Britain has international treaty obligations to exempt a class of international organisations from a particular imposition, it does not seem to be beyond the bounds of reason to deal with those exemptions in primary legislation. It is absurd to try to put the pieces together later—perhaps on the introduction of air passenger duty—in an attempt effectively to construct a schedule of the international organisations that will be exempt. Should not we produce such a schedule?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why are these organisations exempt? I am not entirely satisfied that our international treaty obligations mean that air passenger duty should be part of the exemption. Do British nationals who work abroad in similar organisations enjoy the same treatment? When we travel abroad as parliamentarians, we are subject to such duties, and I imagine that the same applies to Ministers. The Minister may correct me, but I believe that the diplomatic service does not pay APD.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some years ago, when I was a Member of the European Parliament, I noted that Greek Members of that Parliament were exempt from duties when they returned to Greece from the European Parliament's venues, which I felt was grotesque and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0535">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
outrageous. I return to my earlier intervention, when I said that all should be equal before the law, especially those who hold privileged positions in international bodies. Can the Liberals help me in that regard? Why are the Government—a Labour Government—considering immunities and privileges? Should not we all be equal before the law?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heath</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give the hon. Gentleman the same reply that he received from the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham: I do not speak for the Labour Government—although some people might say that we do. Liberal Democrats have been striving for a common statute in Europe, which would prevent the abuse to which the hon. Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) refers. Unfortunately, we have been blocked all the way by the Conservatives in Europe, and we have found it difficult to make progress. However, that is a diversion, and I should return to the orders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are not debating European rules. We should return to the orders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heath</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should find myself out of favour with you, Mr. Cunningham, if I were to pursue that line of argument any further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should consider the reciprocity of such arrangements. Could a mechanism be employed that would save us from the trouble of having to produce such orders on a piecemeal basis? We should identify international organisations that should benefit from privileges under our international treaty obligations, and ensure that there is a comprehensive list of the relevant duties, privileges and immunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn briefly to the International Copper Study Group. I read its terms of reference with care and I notice that the relevant Command Paper—the Minister referred to it; it is dated June 1998 and it is available from the Vote Office—states that the United Kingdom has not accepted them. The Committee is considering an order that is based on terms of reference that the Government have not yet accepted. However, I note that they were drawn up in New York on 24 February 1989. Obviously, membership of this important body, to which the Minister has drawn attention, was not of the greatest urgency. The terms of reference have sat on Minister's desks for the past 10 years. Nothing whatsoever has been done, although the copper industry in this country does not seem to have suffered great disbenefit. However, we are required to make provision for immunities that are required under the terms of reference. Will the Minister explain why the previous Government felt that it was so inappropriate to make progress with the terms of reference, which were available from 1989, and why has this matter suddenly become a matter of urgency?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.19 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This debate, which has waxed into philosophy and political history, has been more entertaining than I anticipated. I should tell the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) that he is not entitled to answer for a Labour Government. Nor will I answer for the previous Conservative Government on
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
the important issue of the International Copper Study Group, except to say that the Opposition did not object strenuously to our membership of it. I can only assume that, having taken on board the value of the group, they have moved with the times, recognised the need to update conservatism and performed a volte face from the position that they took when in government. I think that all members of the Committee would accept that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not want the Minister to give the Committee the impression that I furnished him with a blank sheet of paper on which to write down the membership of the International Copper Study Group. On the contrary, I trust that, in his reply, he will justify granting it special immunities and privileges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There may be some confusion. The ICSG Study Group is based in Lisbon and, as such, has very little activity in the United Kingdom. The order agrees our membership of the group, rather than offering it privileges and immunities per se. Essentially, the order that deals with legal capacities is not concerned with immunities. It confers the legal capacity that is required under the terms of reference, which the Government have accepted. As the order and the explanatory note make clear, the order will grant the ICSG the legal capacities of a body corporate. As a body corporate, the group will be allowed to conclude contracts, buy and sell properties and institute and defend legal proceedings in the United Kingdom. Those are not immunities or privileges but the standard terms and conditions that we would expect any individual or corporate body based in the United Kingdom to honour when conducting ordinary business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister explain why the order is necessary? He is giving the impression that our joining the ICSG was slipped in at the last minute. Does the group plan to do any of the things that he has just outlined? What would prevent it from doing them in this country, if we failed to pass the order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a very good question. I shall ensure that I write to the hon. Lady about the activities that the group currently plans to undertake. I should say that I am not aware that it plans to undertake any activities in this country, and that is the advice on which I must operate. Clearly, the group must have a legal identity. If nothing else, in terms of their conduct, that would protect British citizens and businesses. A body that does not have a legal presence in this country is not capable of entering into legal contracts. Equally, it cannot be taken through the normal legal processes if it is found to be in default. Therefore, it is important that such a body has a legal identity in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find that extraordinary. Why should the Government go to the lengths of producing an order—secondary legislation—when, surely, the ICSG could buy a shelf company in this country, which would give it legal presence here and enable it to contract in any way, shape or form? What prevents it from doing that? Why must it use up the time of the House by being the subject of secondary legislation? If there is a rational explanation, but I should like to hear it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heath</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is a member of the ICSG, as I understand the terms of reference, with a 0·48 per cent. share of the copper market. Does that cause any legal impediment to Britain joining the group, considering the current status of the Yugoslav Republic?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. If Yugoslavia is a member of another international organisation, that does not give Yugoslavia the controlling say in such an organisation. I am astonished if anyone is suggesting that the ICSG should not have a legal presence in this country because, were it not to have such a presence, that would leave our citizens unprotected against study group, were it to renege on contracts, for example. Within those terms, it is important that we establish that legal presence. By convention, it is better that such an international organisation is established under this legislation because that is the normal way in which things are done. The Committee need not be detained by this issue because it is normal, standard practice for such organisations to operate on this basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister tell me what other similar organisations operate in this country on such a basis?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be happy to provide that information to the hon. Lady in due course, but I do not have it at my fingertips. I know that equivalent study groups exist in similar areas relating to minerals and metals, and this is certainly not an unprecedented operation. In the order, the Government are responding to a request and advice from the industry. Those involved in copper in the United Kingdom want us to be members of the study group because they believe that membership provides them with access to the ways in which issues relating to copper are dealt with internationally, so that they can ensure that those issues are dealt with in a way that is consistent with the needs of our own industry. Hon. Members have raised some issues of fundamental philosophy—some of which I shall touch on when I discuss contracts of immunity—but I am surprised that the order has become a philosophical battleground. However, I do not complain about hon. Members raising whatever issues they wish to raise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several matters have been raised, and I said to the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham that I would provide examples of other such bodies that enjoy similar legal status. A number of those bodies—the International Rubber Study Group, the International Coffee Organisation and the International Sugar Organisation—have UK offices, and are therefore required to have a legal presence in this country in order to honour contracts. The ICSG—although it has no UK office, and may never have one or seek to exercise any element of the legal framework—is therefore put on the same footing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Heath</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the last time that I shall make an intervention in this Committee. Will the ICSG therefore be put on exactly the same basis as the other organisations listed in the order on international immunities and privileges, such as the International Lead and Zinc Study Group, the International Rubber Study Group, and the International Wheat Council? I want to confirm that all such organisations will be on the same
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
legal footing in this country, and that it will not be necessary to introduce another order to regularise and make further adjustments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to that is yes. I shall address the hon. Gentleman's more general point about what he regards as an ad hoc approach, but that may be more appropriate when I discuss the other two orders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to clarify what the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome said in his intervention, and what the Minister said in reply. The order on the ICSG does not include a specific immunity from the payment of insurance premium tax and air passenger duty, and the ICSG is not named in the other order. Will the Minister give me an absolute assurance that there will not be a requirement for yet another order to introduce the exemption from the two taxes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the answer is yes on both points, although I shall have to check whether it should be no to the first and yes to the second. In any event, my answers are consistent with what the hon. Lady seeks an assurance on. The order puts the ICSG on the same footing as other similar study groups, but it does not confer exemption—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it does not confer exemption from the two taxes because the ICSG is not an international body. The three orders are being considered on the same morning not because there is a need to read across immunities and privileges that apply in the second and third orders into the first, but for the Committee's convenience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that this intervention will reduce the time that I may want to speak at a later date, so I thank the Minister and you, Mr. Cunningham, for your forbearance. Is the Minister saying that the ICSG will not have the same immunities and privileges as, for example, the International Lead and Zinc Study Group that is named in the other order? I am happy for the Minister to clarify his thinking on that, as I too find it muddling, and have great sympathy with him. Will the order on legal capacities create a second class of organisation that does not have the same immunities and privileges as those mentioned in the other order, or will the Committee have to consider a further order on the ICSG, which would grant exemption from insurance premium tax and air passenger duty?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can help the hon. Lady. The location of the headquarters of such organisations is the key. For example, the International Lead and Zinc Group—according to the various texts that I have in front of me—has a headquarters agreement with the organisations. That is the basis on which the exemption is conferred. In the case of the ICSG, there is no proposal, as far as I am aware, for a headquarters agreement. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I can see that I am moving in the right direction in terms of clarifying matters. That is the essential distinction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Organisations with which the second and third orders deal have more privileges and immunities, but exemption from duty and taxation applies only to organisations in the UK. Exemption applies to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0537">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
organisations outside the UK only where there is an existing initial obligation for refunds. I have been advised that no such liability will arise in respect of the ICSG.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Chesham and Amersham and for Somerton and Frome raised interesting points that have benefited the Committee, and I must reassure them about the direction that we are taking. The scope of the first order is limited. It will not grant the immunities that the second and third orders will grant to other international bodies. As part of our membership of the ICSG in the UK, the order simply establishes the group's legal form. I am not aware of plans to extend equivalent immunities to the group, but I shall try to ascertain whether such plans exist. If they do, I shall ask the obvious question, which is why the group has not benefited by incorporation into the second order. I can assure the Committee that, although the matter is of fundamental concern to Opposition parties, it is not germane to the order. However, they are right to raise it, and I shall try to discover its long-term future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members have asked various questions about the second and third orders. According to current information on the moneys involved, collection of the two forms of taxation—insurance premium and air passenger duty—began in 1994, and exemptions will be backdated to payments made from that date. In the financial year 1999–2000, there will be a liability of about £700,000. Thereafter, there will be an on-going, annual liability of about £260,000. Depending on the context and perspective, that is or is not a lot of money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Quite legitimately, the hon. Member for Solihull asked why any immunities and privileges are offered, and why all citizens and corporate bodies are not treated on the same basis. It has been the policy of successive Governments that, as a matter of custom and practice, privileges and immunities are granted to international organisations. That is not new. The hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham is right to say that privileges and immunities are granted on the basis of functional need, but that need is designed to guarantee the independence of organisations and the equality of member states. There is a principle that the host nation should not derive undue fiscal advantage from a form of taxation that results from the presence of international organisations located on its soil. If we tax and other nations do not, international organisations would not have a strong incentive to locate their operations or headquarters in this country. However, that might not apply in a competitive situation. We are hosts to several such organisations—we feel good will towards them—and we perform a sensible role in that regard. I do not sympathise with the idea that we should do away with the concept of privileges and immunities altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome raised questions about what he regards as an ad hoc process. He has raised that matter with me previously, and no doubt with others. He said that instead of having one general piece of primary legislation, which would group all the relevant provisions together, we use secondary legislation. One reason for that is because circumstance
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
change. The third order, which relates to Intelsat, is particularly relevant in that regard because it is a relatively new development. I believe that its headquarters is in the United States, but it has decided to have a physical location here in the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Heath</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A satellite.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, a satellite. I earlier had to forbear from making jokes about burnished copper, but the hon. Gentleman is getting his own back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that circumstances change means that we cannot give a general exemption to organisations that may be established or that may need such immunity and protection. It is better, and more convenient for Parliament, to focus parliamentary scrutiny at the point of extension of immunity. That is preferable to giving a blanket, one-off immunity at any particular moment. Such provisions would either have to be constantly revised by Parliament in primary legislation or they would be so all-embracing that Parliament would not be able to scrutinise them properly when immunities and privileges were extended. There is logic in the way in which the present system works. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome has more opportunities to scrutinise the specifics than he would have if primary legislation were involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am conscious that I may not have dealt with all of the questions that were asked. If any matters are pressing, I should be happy for Committee members to raise them. Alternatively, I shall respond to points of detail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why are we considering these organisations and not others? Why not the Commonwealth Development Corporation, charities or other international organisations? Why only these 26 organisations? Is a pattern involved? Will we consider another order that deals with a further 26 organisations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that no is the answer. The matter arises because of the imposition of the two duties in 1994. What we might call a leisurely process is involved, although that would not lead us to backdate the exemption. The matter arises as a result of custom and practice and the conventions that we, as an international participant, accept. The order deals with 26 organisations, but 43 organisations will have relief. They either already have relief as a result of other orders, or the relevant legal obligations still have to be fulfilled, and the exemptions will be granted under subsequent legislation. It does not make sense to delay any longer the repayments of tax and duty to organisations on the list. It is right that we should return those moneys paid between 1994 and the present. If necessary, we shall return to Parliament to extend the exemptions to other organisations that ought to benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The organisations that benefit are not diplomatic missions, but internationally constituted organisations. I cannot give a watertight definition to the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham today, but I shall try to do so in future. Charities are not constituted in the same way as international organisations bringing together member states as participants. The significant factor about such organisations is that their membership is at state-to-state level, or possibly that they are bodies that incorporate
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0538">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
states operating in conjunction with one other, such as the European Union, which is also a member. Charities clearly do not operate in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady mentioned the Commonwealth Development Corporation. I shall investigate why the CDC does not qualify under these provisions. I suspect that it is because the membership of the organisation does not include nation states as full participants. However, I cannot give her a proper definition of its legal status at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Interesting questions have been raised about the extension of the provisions to other organisations, and I undertake to examine whether there would be any logic in such extensions. However, I do not want to raise the Committee's expectations on that issue, nor do I want to raise the expectations of bodies such as the CDC that they may be moving towards the return of those duties. I will examine the matter, and try to do what I can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of the points raised are of great interest and will be read avidly in places as far away as Chesham and Amersham, Somerton and Frome, and, no doubt, in the parts of eastern and central Manchester that I represent. People will know that the Committee has done its best to scrutinise these important pieces of secondary legislation, as is our obligation to Parliament. That is an important function. Serious issues have been raised today that I want to examine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the issues of principle alter the common sense of the orders. Most of the points raised have concerned whether the provisions ought to be extended further, and what the parallels are for other organisations. None of the points raised has cast doubt on the validity of the orders' going through. However, I undertake to examine the wider context, to ascertain whether there are parallels that we ought to examine. I also undertake, where appropriate, to respond to the hon. Members who raised those issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.48 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his honest replies and his attempts to answer the questions of Opposition Members. He has been most generous with his time and his offers. I look forward to his replies on the matters about which he intends to write to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I confirm to the Minister that I have no intention of blocking the orders. However, I would like further and better particulars, which I hope that he will provide to the House at the same time that he is writing to me on the matters discussed today. Will he place on record the requests from the industry in this country to join the copper study group? It would be of great interest for people to see those requests, and perhaps that information could be placed in the Library.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, there is tremendous demand to join the group, but as the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome said, a long time has elapsed since the original documentation was issued and the group was set up. Therefore, it would be good to know what demand came from the industry, to be able to compare that with any other demands from other industrial sectors to join such international groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
The amounts outlined by the Minister—the £700,000 backlog of payments that will now be taken from the Exchequer and given back to the 26 organisations—constitute only half the story because I believe that the Minister said that 43 organisations were entitled to recoup those two payments of tax. I should be grateful if the Minister could let the Committee know whether that repayment attracts interest, how that interest is calculated and whether the organisations make any demands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister estimated that the annual repayment or loss to the Exchequer would be about £260,000. Can he say whether that figure is the total bill for the 26 or the 43 organisations? The Minister did not say whether this set of immunities and privileges will be reviewed on a regular basis, so I should like some clarification, at some stage, about the review process for granting privileges and immunities. In addition, will the Minister say whether any consideration has been given to amending primary legislation, so that there is some sort of automatic filter, because the entire process seems messy? I appreciate that that might not be the Minister's fault—this is not a matter of allocating blame. However, just as, in considering the copper study group, we have been able to ask whether it will be necessary to introduce another order in a few months time to exempt it from the two taxes, the whole process must be examined to determine whether it can he streamlined, so that it takes up less administrative time, less Government time and perhaps even less time—heaven forfend—in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those matters are important, and I am glad that the Minister has had the opportunity to hear the views of Opposition Members. We are just a little sad that, yet again, Labour Members have been mute, because I am sure that many of them have a valuable contribution to make to the debate. They seem to be strangely silent these days—perhaps it has something to do with the Government Whip. The Minister said that he wanted to examine some of the issues himself. I hope that our questions and suggestions have been constructive and helpful, and will help him to do his job better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.53 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I can be brief and bring the Committee to a conclusion. Let me say to the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham that the lead in relation to the ICSG comes from the Department of Trade and Industry. That Department would have received representations from industry and can give better information than I can about the relative strength of demand from those involved in copper. I suspect that a question to DTI Ministers would elicit that information in the most efficient way, but I shall pass on the hon. Lady's comments to my colleagues at the DTI and undertake to ensure that they are aware of her request.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham also asked about costs. The total cost that I quoted is for all 43 organisations—the total cost to the Exchequer of the operation—and no interest is payable on accrued sums. This is a catching-up exercise and there is no expectation of interest being incurred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
I may be profligate with your time, Mr. Cunningham, and that of the Committee, but I have enjoyed enormously the cut and thrust of Parliamentary debate in Committee this morning. My hon. Friends frequently raise issues with me in the Division Lobby in the evening or whenever we meet because that is a sure way of guaranteeing ministerial accountability. I pay tribute to each and every one of my hon. Friends for their interest in the three orders. The fact that they volunteered to attend the Committee shows how seriously they want the orders to be implemented. They probably resent my generosity to the Opposition instead of forcing the orders through.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams (East Carmarthen and Dinefwr)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised that 55 minutes have elapsed with no mention of gold. Copper, zinc and lead have been mentioned, but gold sales are taking place. We have of course had discussions in the Lobby and elsewhere, so I did not intend to intervene on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend raises an important point, but there are two reasons for not responding, if he will forgive me. The first is that it would be out of order and the second is that because of the intense debate that takes place within the Parliamentary Labour party, it is not necessary to satisfy him beyond the satisfaction he already has with the operation of the Labour Government, not only on gold sales, but across the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall consider the matter, but I do not want to raise expectations of a change. I am not convinced that there is any inefficiency, but I believe that it would be inefficient to have blanket, all-embracing primary or secondary legislation. Things change: organisations change their names and relocate, and international arrangements vary. In a society such as ours with a functioning Parliament that scrutinises and takes more than 57 minutes to consider the three orders before us, Parliament should be able to do the job. Coming to the House to update matters is not a waste of Parliament's time, but ensures that the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
process and principles of dealing with secondary legislation are properly established and re-established by the practice of scrutiny. There may seem to be a danger of using such Committees lightly, but I did not take our exchanges this morning lightly because, although our proceedings were relaxed, important issues were raised, The House should value the way in which we review secondary legislation, and we have all tried to do that this morning. I cannot promise that another way would be a better way, because it might be to the disadvantage of hon. Members who want to raise issues. I shall examine the matter and if there is a definitive conclusion, I shall return to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my words today, my commitment to examine what is important and to place that on the record, and my commitment to write to hon. Members have satisfied the Committee that the three orders should be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
