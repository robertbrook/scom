Clause 19</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
SCOPE OF MECHANISM</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 170, in page 14, line 32, leave out
<br><blockquote><p>'other than an excepted public service scheme.'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'> With this it will be convenient to take the following amendment No. 171, in page 14, leave out lines 38 to 41.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When I first read clause 19 I could not quite understand its purpose. When I saw the reference to an excepted public service pension scheme, my initial reaction was that it might be part of the Government's nefarious intention to exempt certain public sector schemes from the transfer provisions applying to other pension schemes, with which we shall deal when we reach schedule 5. I looked at the Government's explanatory memorandum and realised that the purpose of the clause was to enable the Government to exempt public service schemes involving distinguished persons who occupy what are known as great offices of state.<br><br>
My imagination was therefore triggered—I wondered about those who occupy the great offices of state. The Prime Minister, as far as I know, has a successful marriage, is not contemplating a divorce and does not need protection from the pension-splitting provisions in the Bill. The Speaker, as far as I know, is not contemplating the sacrament of matrimony. If she were, she would be some way from contemplating a divorce. I began to think of the Lord Chancellor, who might need protection against the provisions of the Bill. Then I thought of the Foreign Secretary—I could see the point of exempting him from its provisions. No doubt that is part of the agenda.<br><br>
This is a narrow issue—the number of great offices of state is restricted—but the Government are proposing a rather curious procedure. Even if only a small number of people are exempted from the threat of sharing their pensions on divorce, the exemption of anyone—however high their position in society or the state—is problematic in a democracy where there is the rule of law. I am therefore not inclined—despite what the Committee might have supposed—to say that a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 448</span>
few great figures should have special status above the law, as if they were members of the Chinese mandarinate or the imperial family. That is not a good principle to follow.<br><br>
Will the Under-Secretary explain the rationale of the privileged regime that clause 19 would allow? It is ironic that the Prime Minister will be one of the beneficiaries, even though the Government intend to impose restrictions on—and threats to—the pension assets of the ordinary citizen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments would bring all public service schemes within the scope of pension sharing. I assure the Committee that the Government intend that the overwhelming majority of pension rights in public service schemes will be available for pension sharing. As the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford, but no longer Spalding—I have no doubt that the loss is for the people of Spalding—said, the amendment concerns a narrow group of people. We intend to use the clause's regulation-making power extremely sparingly to except those schemes that cover a handful of people whose pension arrangements are, by their nature unsuitable for pension sharing.<br><br>
The explanatory notes to the Bill signal our intention to except the great offices of state, by which is meant the special pension arrangements applying to former Prime Ministers, former Lord Chancellors and former Speakers. We do not intend to except the office of Foreign Secretary or any other current parliamentary office. However, in deference to my hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth, I should add that we also intend to except pension arrangements for the Scottish First Minister and the Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament. Therefore, the Government intend to except five offices.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Lait</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have no Welsh connections, but why are the Government discriminating against Wales?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are not discriminating against Wales. Unlike the pension arrangements for the Scottish First Minister and the Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament, those for senior personnel in the Welsh Assembly are not analogous to those of the Prime Minister and the Speaker.<br><br>
The pension arrangements for the great offices of state are unique because the pension comes into payment immediately the postholder leaves office, regardless of the period of office. In each case, the pension is equal to half the salary of the incumbent on leaving office. However, to place a capital value on salary-related pension rights, an actuary needs to know the date on which the pension normally comes into payment. Without that information, it is impossible to capitalise the income stream due from the pension. For example, under the civil service pension scheme, the normal retirement age is 60; under our scheme, the normal retirement age of Members of Parliament is 65. When you have a defined date, it is possible to put a capital value on the income stream due from a pension—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not have a defined date.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0717">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 449</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In respect of the three great offices of state, there is no defined eligibility date. It is therefore impossible to put a capital value on the pension and, in turn, technically impossible to achieve pension splitting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mark Oaten <span class='memberconstituency'>(Winchester)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would appreciate some reassurance. I cannot believe that the circumstances described affect only those three individuals. Other complex pension systems must fall into a similar category. The Government appear to be setting a precedent that could add many other categories. The exclusion of those individuals will send a bad signal to most ordinary people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me stress that it is not the nature of the great offices of state that leads to the exclusion of those schemes from pension-sharing arrangements, but merely the technical difficulties associated with valuing their pension rights. We are not aware of any comparable pension arrangements. However, Committee members will know that, in a small number of other cases, the regulation-making powers contained in the clause will allow an exemption to be made, should such cases be drawn to our attention. Nevertheless, we are working on the assumption that only the five offices to which I referred have pension arrangements that preclude pension splitting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What is the position of other Ministers in the House of Lords? What is the notional retirement date for the purposes of the scheme?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I regret to say that I am not enough of an expert on the parliamentary contributory pension scheme to comment on the position of Ministers, past or present.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The amendment does not apply to the parliamentary contributory scheme, which is separate from the ministerial scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Ministerial pension schemes are based on the assumption that they will begin to operate at the normal age of 65. The pension that is attached to the three great offices of state is different because it is payable as soon as the person concerned leaves office.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The situation in the private sector is analogous. The date on which a private sector chairman will retire, and what his final salary pension will be, is unknown, although the pension will have been topped up enormously during his last two or three years in his position to ensure that he has a generous pension. A theoretical, acturial calculation can be done when a chairman is 40 and on the way up. It is based on what the capital value would be if his pension arrangements were frozen. That calculation is purely theoretical, but it is analogous to the circumstances of the great offices of state. One could estimate, on an averaged basis, the present value of the pension of a great officer of state, although one does not know when he or she will retire. It is illusory to suggest that the problem cannot be tackled.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 450</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The pension scheme of a private sector company chairman will define the relevant contributions and benefits, and it is possible to ascribe a capital value to the scheme on the basis of those contributions and benefits. The hon. Gentleman should consider one of the three great offices of state, or one of those in Scotland. The Prime Minister is at least 20 years away from his age of retirement. None of us can speculate on the date at which he will leave office—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At the next election.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Some Committee members may speculate on that date for political purposes, but the hon. Gentleman's daydream is not the basis for a serious actuarial valuation.<br><br>
Holders of the great offices of state may have other pensions. For example, the Prime Minister and the Speaker of the House have pensions as Members of the House, and those pensions are eligible for pension splitting in the same way as any other occupational pension. The special circumstances that attach to the pension arrangements for the three great offices of state and to the two offices that will be created in the Scottish Parliament do not allow for pension splitting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oaten</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I now understand the Minister's logic. However, perhaps we should set logic aside for a moment and consider a basic principle: the public distrust their politicians so much that it might be worth dealing with the complex issues that would be involved if the relevant clauses were removed from the Bill. Excluding the Prime Minister from the provisions that will apply to the rest of the population will send a negative signal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me make it perfectly clear that the Prime Minister, the Lord Chancellor and the Speaker of the House of Commons are not above the law. Their pension arrangements—save the pension that they get by virtue of holding a great office of state—are dealt with in the same way as any other person's pension arrangements. The hon. Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten) tempts the wrath of powerful people by suggesting that that legislation which we are not discussing this evening, should be changed. If he believes that the pensions available to the three great office holders of state should be changed, he is a Member of the House and is at liberty to propose legislation to achieve that.<br><br>
That is not what we are discussing. We are discussing existing pension arrangements, and we must ensure that the legislation is compatible with those.</span></p>
<p>8.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is easy to arrive at a present value. If the average length of service for Prime Ministers, Speakers and any other office holder is calculated, the present value can be arrived at by comparing how long the current office holder has been in office and the average term. It is not a difficult exercise to calculate an expected value.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 451</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was a good try, but the sample is so small that a serious valuation is not possible. The hon. Gentleman's knowledge of history is as good as mine and he knows that the period of office of Prime Ministers varies enormously, as does the time that they enjoy in retirement after leaving office.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Pond <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gravesham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was a little worried about that intervention. The likely period of office of the current incumbent of the Prime Minister's post could unbalance the average.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes the point about small samples more succinctly than I can. His example clarifies why it would be foolish to use an average when the number of people involved is so small.<br><br>
These probing amendments have been useful and ensured that the Government explained what they have in mind for individual schemes that will be exempted under the clause. The provision refers to only five offices, so I ask the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford to withdraw his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that there are other people in that category. I believe that field marshals receive half pay immediately they retire for the rest of their lives and that some senior diplomats are put en disponibilité on the same terms.<br><br>
I am grateful for the Minister's explanation and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><i>Question proposed, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. The clause lists the various mechanisms that can be used to trigger the pension-sharing provisions in clause 21. The aim has been to create a flexible framework consistent with the rules of family law in the different jurisdictions in the United Kingdom. In England and Wales, and in Scotland, a couple may share pension rights either by court order or by agreement. An order or agreement made in Scotland may be activated in England and Wales and vice versa. We envisage that the corresponding Northern Ireland legislation will make reciprocal provision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Subsection (7) of clause 20 states that the order will be deemed not to have taken effect if the person responsible has not received the itemised documents in two months. There are no provisions for appeals or exceptions in England. However, subsection (10) states that in Scotland:
<br><blockquote><p>"The sheriff may, on the application of any person having an interest, make an order—
<br><blockquote><p>(a) extending the period of 2 months".</p></blockquote></p></blockquote>
There is therefore an element of flexibility in Scotland, but not in England. What is the rationale for that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am struggling to answer that question. I will need to study the subsections to which the hon. Gentleman referred and write to him with the answer.</span></p>

CASH EQUIVALENTS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 172, in page 18, line 11, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(1A) Such regulations shall ensure that all such calculations and verifications are based on the methodology currently accepted by the actuarial profession for the purpose of valuing pension assets and liabilities, and that no such calculation or verification shall include any amounts in respect of any pension benefits other than those which the rules of the relevant pension scheme at the relevant time oblige the trustees or managers of such a scheme to pay out to pensioners or their dependants.'.</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0719">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 453</span>
This is an important issue, although perhaps not the most momentous, that concerns pension splitting and the methodology that will be used. The purpose of the amendment is to avoid all doubt and peradventure—for the greater security of the public and the greater clarity of the law—and any unnecessary costs, litigation and disputes. I have therefore ventured my hand at a definition of the methodology to be used, which is that
<br><blockquote><p>"Such regulations shall ensure that all such calculations and verifications are based on the methodology currently accepted by the actuarial profession for the purpose of valuing pension assets and liabilities"—</p></blockquote>
In other words, it must be the same technology that actuaries are using to advise their clients for any other purpose, be it to ensure that an occupational fund is solvent, or valuing pension assets for transfers of assets from one fund to another. The definition continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"and that no such calculation or verification shall include any amounts in respect of any pension benefits other than those which the rules of the relevant pension scheme at the relevant time oblige the trustees or managers of such a scheme to pay out to pensioners or their dependants."</p></blockquote>
The object of that phrase is to remove any doubt as to whether the cash equivalent transfer value should include an element for discretionary benefits. It is the practice of trustees in some funds to use some of the surplus available to give benefits higher than those that they are contractually obliged to provide under the rules of the scheme. It is always a problem for actuaries valuing a pension scheme, or someone's share in an occupational pension scheme, whether to take account of the fact that, although there is no obligation on the trustees to provide certain benefits in practice, such benefits have been provided or there is some expectation that they should be.<br><br>
We must have clarity on the matter. It would be very wrong if people were to lose a share of their pension, under pension-sharing or pension-splitting arrangements, as a result of the actuary responsible for the valuation process taking account of benefits that people will not receive because the trustees will not use such discretion. Of course, it is perfectly possible that any surplus in a pension scheme that might provide a basis for discretion today will no longer exist at the relevant time, when the decision is made about discretionary benefits. We believe that it is right to take a conservative view on the matter—in other words, to make a prudent view—and to make sure that it is clear to actuaries what their responsibilities are in the valuation process.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman explained, the amendment has two parts. On the first part, I agree that it is important to ensure that, where necessary, a cash equivalent should be calculated using accepted actuarial methods. That is clearly the case for valuing salary-related schemes, but in a pure money-purchase scheme, the value of the pension fund is clear and there is no need for any actuarial assumption to be made.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 454</span>
Where an estimate of the value of the benefits does need to be obtained, as in a salary-related scheme, we will ensure in regulations that cash equivalents are calculated in a manner approved by the scheme's actuary. In turn, the actuary will be subject to the professional guidance issued by the Institute of Actuaries and the Faculty of Actuaries in Scotland, and that guidance will be extended to include pension sharing. I hope that that satisfies the hon. Gentleman on the rules for cash equivalence.<br><br>
The second part of the amendment is more difficult because it would prevent any benefit that the scheme is not obliged to pay from being included in the calculation of the cash equivalent. The hon. Gentleman advocated that provision on the grounds that it would create confidence and certainty, and everyone would know where they stood. The trouble is that it would do so in a way that would work to the disadvantage of beneficiaries of pension sharing. The intention is that, for ease of administration, the cash equivalent for pension sharing should be the same as that which applies now to early leavers. However, the amendment would create a difference between the two, as well as being unfair to the former spouse.<br><br>
In relation to normal transfer values, the established custom is for additional benefits to be awarded at the discretion of the trustees or employer, and the cash equivalent must take account of any benefits that will accrue if the custom continues unaltered, unless the trustees have ruled that such benefits should be ignored. The most important of those discretionary benefits tend to be increases over and above the statutory minimum for pensions in payment.<br><br>
In addition, the trustees cannot make a direction to ignore discretionary benefits unless they have consulted the scheme actuary and obtained a written report. That must include the actuary's opinion on whether there would be any adverse implications for the funding of the scheme if the value of discretionary benefits was included in the cash equivalent calculation. It is right that similar provisions should apply in pension-sharing cases. There is a well-established procedure in relation to early leavers. If the scheme is well funded to meet the discretionary benefits and chooses to include them in cash equivalents for early leavers, it is right that it should also include them in pension-sharing cases. Otherwise, the cash equivalent calculation in a pension-sharing case will understate the effective value of the member's rights, and that would be unfair to the former spouse. That is not what we intend in the clause. I hope that what I have said will persuade the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It works either way. There is a danger that if the trustees do not continue with a more generous policy on discretionary benefits, the loser in a pension-splitting exercise may be the member of the pension scheme, who may lose a share of something that he will never receive because he will not get the discretionary benefits. Should the unfairness benefit the transferor or the transferee? It is my considered

view that the bias should be towards the transferor who, after all, earns the pension. We would prefer to err on his or her side.<br><br>

<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This clause enables the Secretary of State to make regulations on the calculation and verification of cash equivalence—the process that we have started to discuss—which is the capitalised value of pension rights for the purposes of pension sharing. The provisions are similar to those in section 97 of the Pension Schemes Act 1993 on the calculation of cash equivalence for members of occupational and personal pension schemes who are transferring their pension rights to other schemes. It would be inappropriate to detain the Committee unduly on technical matters, but I believe that the methodology for calculating cash equivalence is right.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This clause provides for the reduction of the pension rights of the members whose pension is to be shared. Each benefit in England and Wales that comes within the scope of the pension-sharing order or agreement is reduced by the appropriate percentage. If the order or agreement specifies an amount rather than a percentage, the clause also makes provision for each benefit to be reduced by the percentage that that amount represents of the current cash equivalent of the member's pension rights. That is because, as we discussed earlier, a Scottish pension-sharing order may set out either a specified amount or a percentage of the other party's pension rights.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 173, in page 20, leave out lines 6 to 11.<br><br>
Let me briefly explain our objection to the clause—[<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 456</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am finding it difficult to listen to the hon. Gentleman because there is a stereo sound coming from behind him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. McWilliam.<br><br>
Our objection to the clause is that it provides for guaranteed minimum pensions and protected rights to be subject to pension sharing. Guaranteed minimum pensions are the portion of a classical, salary-related pension that corresponds to the proportion of the contributions which represent the state earning-related pension scheme rebate. In the case of money-purchase schemes, the protected rights also correspond to that proportion. In other words, it is the equivalent of SERPS.<br><br>
We object to the idea of splitting SERPS. Our reason for that is simple. We are talking about small amounts of money that provide small pensions, and the costs are often disproportionate to the sums involved. It is particularly unacceptable to split small pensions on which people depend. The person who has earned the pension may be forced to seek means-tested benefits from the state instead of the former spouse, although neither option is ideal. It simply may not be worth taking small amounts of money from a person's earnings and forcing them on to state benefits, while incurring the costs and complications associated with transferring that money to someone else.<br><br>
Doubtless the Government will not accept that point, but there is a potentially sinister aspect of the clause to which we want to draw attention and on which we seek reassurance. I hope that the phrase that the amendment would remove from the clause does not warrant the interpretation that it appears superficially to warrant. Subsection (4) will amend section 47 of the Pension Schemes Act 1993 by adding the following, potentially nefarious, subsection. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"(6) For the purposes of section 46, a person shall be treated as entitled to any guaranteed minimum pension to which he would have been entitled but for any reduction under section 15A."</p></blockquote>
A person who lost a share of his guaranteed minimum pension and who was forced by the lack of any additional pension to claim means-tested welfare payment, will not so qualify under subsection (4) if it is interpreted to mean that he is deemed to have that proportion of his guaranteed minimum pension to which he was originally entitled by virtue of his work record and rebates paid from SERPS on his behalf, a part of which was paid away as part of the pension split. That would be unfair.<br><br>
We are willing to allow the clause to stand without further let or hindrance, provided that we are assured that subsection (4) will not permit a person to be denied means-tested benefits to which they would otherwise have been entitled because they are deemed to have a share of a guaranteed minimum pension that, in practice, they have lost.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that he seeks: the clause will not jeopardise anyone's entitlement to income-related benefits. If the amendment were accepted, following a pension-sharing order the state would have to make up some of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0721">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 457</span>
the shortfall in a members's pension by providing a higher benefit from SERPS. Clearly, that would breach the principle—with which all Committee members agree—that the taxpayer should not pick up the bill for the divorce. The SERPS would be split, but the state scheme would need to make up some of the loss incurred by the person whose pension was split.<br><br>
It might assist the Committee if I explain the relationship between SERPS and contracted-out pension schemes. Until April 1997, some members of contracted-out pension schemes and appropriate personal pension holders built up entitlement to SERPS in addition to their occupational or personal pension rights. On reaching the state retirement age, an individual's notional SERPS entitlement is calculated and a sum is deducted that roughly equals the contracted-out pension. Any banance is paid with the basic state retirement pension. The deduction prevents the double provision of the same pension from the state scheme and the occupational pension scheme.<br><br>
The clause will make it clear that a member's guaranteed minimum pension and protected rights—the contracted-out pension—can be shared on divorce, so that on reaching state retirement age, he will receive a reduced pension. That is entirely appropriate and I see no reason for excluding the state scheme from the provisions in the clause. However, to protect the interests of the taxpayer, the clause will also provide that entitlement to state benefits will be calculated as if the pension-sharing order had not taken effect. To do otherwise would force the taxpayer to reimburse any part of a member's guaranteed minimum pension or protected rights that had been lost as part of the pension share. It cannot be right for divorcing couples to be compensated in that way.<br><br>
In view of that explanation, I hope that the Opposition will withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the clause will ensure that, for the purposes of qualifying for state benefits, the member would be deemed to have that portion of the guaranteed minimum pension that he had lost under a split. We debated that matter earlier. Perhaps the Minister will return to the paper from which he was reading a moment ago. He used the phrase the "essence of my concern", which corresponds almost exactly to the words that I have used. Rather than relieving my concern, he has reinforced it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right—I discussed state benefits. However, what I said about those benefits involves SERPS, not means-tested benefits.</span></p>

MODE OF DISCHARGE OF LIABILITY</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 175, in page 21, line 40, leave out from 'and' to end of line 42 and insert
<br><blockquote><p>'any pension debit charged to a person's pension rights which would otherwise have been transferred to the person entitled to a pension credit shall be restored to the transferor.'.</p></blockquote>
The clause relates to schedule 5, which we shall presently consider. It states that if the potential beneficiary to a pension split dies before a pension credit has been transferred, the credit will be transferred to the estate of the beneficiary of the transferee. The amendment states that if the beneficiary dies, the transfer will not take place and the credit will revert to the original member of the pension scheme.<br><br>
I thought that the Government wanted to help former spouses, not the beneficiaries who are mentioned in the wills of former spouses. There is no rhyme or reason in the suggestion that someone who has worked hard for his or her pension should have it reduced not to assist the former spouse but to provide a bonus to someone—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A toy boy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says that the beneficiary might be a toy boy; the beneficiary might also be a toy girl or someone else who has succeeded in ingratiating themselves into the will of the former spouse. There is no justice in that proposal—it is thoroughly unreasonable. We return to our discussion about whether the transfers should be made so lightly and without considering the impact of the proposal on the person who has worked for the pension.<br><br>
The object may be to benefit former spouses. However, if the former spouse has left this world for another world, where he or she will not need a financial pension whose value is expressed in pounds, shillings and pence, the money should remain with the beneficiary for whom it was originally intended, for whom the Inland Revenue designed designed its tax rules and for whom employers provided contributions. The person concerned doubtless worked hard for that pension.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree with the logic that underlies the amendment for two reasons. First, it would undermine any fair settlement that had been reached by the divorcing couple or that had been ordered by a court. If the pension was the main asset, the amendment would effectively leave the assets of the ex-spouse, whose pension was being shared, virtually untouched by the divorce. Secondly, the amendment would treat pension assets differently from other assets, which become the property of the spouse to whom they are allocated when the relevant financial order takes effect. After the divorce, it is unclear why the scheme member should have any claim on the pension rights that were allocated to the former spouse, even if he or she had since died, or on other financial assets that were allocated as a result of the

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 459</span>
order. We are therefore right to take a regulation-making power to allow a deceased former spouse to be treated as if he or she had become a member of the arrangement in question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no reason why the scheme member—the transferor—should have a claim on the pension assets, when those belong to the transferor in the first place. There may be a conflict between the right of an individual to hold on to the pension assets that he or she has saved and provided for and the need to provide for a former spouse. If the former spouse is no longer there—and therefore does not require provision—no conflict exists. Justice therefore requires that the pension assets should remain with the person who originally held them.</span></p>

PENSION CREDITS: MODE OF DISCHARGE</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 147, in page 76, line 36, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>'(2A) The trustees or managers of the scheme from which a pension credit to which this paragraph applies derives may discharge their liability in respect of the credit by paying the amount of the credit to the person responsible for a qualifying arrangement with a view to acquiring rights under that arrangement for the person entitled to the credit if—
<ol>
<li>the qualifying arrangement is not disqualified as a destination for the credit,</li>
<li>the person responsible for that arrangement is able and willing to accept payment in respect of the credit, and</li>
<li>payment is made with the consent of the person entitled to the credit, or in accordance with regulations made by the Secretary of State.</li></ol></p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(2B) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (2), no account is to be taken of consent of the person entitled to the pension credit unless—
<ol>
<li>it is given after receipt of notice in writing of an offer to discharge liability in respect of the credit by making a payment under sub-paragraph (3), or</li>
<li>it is not withdrawn within 7 days of receipt of such notice.'.</li></ol></p></blockquote>
This is an important amendment, because its effect is to put all schemes on an even basis. In schedule 5, the Government have—wrongly—negotiated in their own interests. They have tried to create a separate regime for non-funded public sector pensions. There is a conflict of interest between the Government, who are supposed to draft even-handed legislation in the cause of justice in this country—they have not succeeded—and the Treasury, which has an interest in minimising expenditure and public sector liabilities, irrespective of any additional costs and liabilities on the private sector and any hardships on private individuals. That fundamental conflict of interest is clearly expressed in the lack of even-handedness in schedule 5.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the reason for the Minister's reticence is that the Government told the Select Committee, in paragraph 69 of its report:
<br><blockquote><p>"the implications for the Exchequer of allowing pension credits to be taken out of unfunded public service schemes would be 'quite significant' and that it could amount to bringing forward up to £190 million of public expenditure in the first year."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for my hon. Friend's useful contribution.<br><br>
The essence of our amendment is that all schemes should be treated on the same basis. That is fair in principle; it is obnoxious in practice if they are not treated on the same basis. The Government are confused. They were confused about the difference between salary-related and money purchase pensions and occupational and group personal pensions and I wonder whether they are again confused between unfunded public sector schemes and non-contributory public sector schemes. Some unfunded public sector schemes are non-contributory—for example, the civil service scheme. Those who contributed to the drafting of the Bill were presumably happy to be in a non-contributory public sector scheme. They may consider it to be a Government handout to be given or

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 461</span>
withdrawn as part of the bounty of the state to its own employees, but many public sector schemes are not funded and are contributory.<br><br>
There is a policeman in the Room, as there so often is, and this is a good opportunity to say that we are well served by the police. I understand that the police—perhaps the policeman will intervene if I am wrong.—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is not in order to refer to any person who is not in the core of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall have to look at the policeman's face to see whether I am wrong when I say that I believe that he contributes 9 per cent. to his pension. The Government do not invest that money on his behalf. They could and should run a funded pension scheme with that 9 per cent., which is a considerable amount of money from all the policemen and policewomen in this country. The Government are good at lecturing people, both here and among our partners in the European Union, on the virtues of funding, but they do not put those contributions in a separate fund. They put the money back in the Treasury and the policeman who is looking after us so well is effectively paying additional tax when his 9 per cent. is extracted from his salary. He later receives a pension, to which he has contributed, but civil servants do not contribute to their pensions.<br><br>
It is invidious that if a policeman or policewomen—the same applies to the armed services—has a pension split and a former spouse receives some benefit or if someone is married to a policeman who is the former spouse and receives some benefit, they will not have the same rights or transfer out of the public sector scheme that everyone else has from a funded public sector or private sector scheme. That is wrong and invidious. It is based either on a misunderstanding of the schemes or on a willingness to be unfair for the sake of being unfair. The Conservative party does not accept that and is determined to do something about it.<br><br>
There was a time when the Labour party was swayed by arguments from the Trades Union Congress, so perhaps Labour Back Benchers will be swayed when they vote on the amendment. The testimony provided to the Select Committee by Ms Joanne Segars on behalf of the TUC referred to schedule 5 and stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"I have to say this is one of the … areas where we are not happy with the proposals of the draft Bill because they will mean that former spouses of unfunded public sector scheme members—there are almost 2 million workers in unfunded public sector pension schemes according to the last Government Actuary's Department survey"—</p></blockquote>
I am grateful that I did not have to obtain that statistic—
<br><blockquote><p>"will be denied the rights that those in public funded schemes like the Local Government Pension Scheme are entitled to."</p></blockquote>
There we have it. The former spouses of local government workers will have the right to transfer, but that is not the case for everyone.<br><br>
Ms Segars went on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"We really do not feel that restricting the interests of former spouses in that way is in the best interests of those former spouses, some of whom might have their own personal pension or
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 462</span>
occupational pension scheme that they might want to add to through a transfer. I think it also contradicts the wider goals of the pension review set out by the Secretary of State to narrow the gap between women and men"—</p></blockquote>
here is a feminist agenda that ought to appeal to new Labour—
<br><blockquote><p>"I think it is our view and the view of the Council of Civil Service Unions"—</p></blockquote>
there was a time when Labour Members would quake at the knees at the mention of the council of Civil Service Unions—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I was a member of the Council of Civil Service Unions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I went to a conference recently that was attended by the Council of Civil Service Unions and public sector unions. It was arranged at the headquarters of the National Union of Teachers. The representatives of many public sector pension schemes were furious with many of the Government's decisions, not least their refusal to honour the consultation period on the stakeholder pension.<br><br>
Ms Segars then said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I was interested to read the Minister's comments on this issue when he gave evidence to the Committee. I think the figure he gave was £190 million as the potential cost but in any case very few people transfer their money out of public service schemes because they are such good schemes.… We do feel the same rights should be applied to members of unfunded public sector schemes and that <i>at the very least</i> people should be able to take transfers to other members of the public sector transfer club."</p></blockquote>
I heartily endorse that remark.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend asks the Minister about the TUC, but the hon. Gentleman does not care about it because it is old Labour. My hon. Friend should ask him about those Labour Members—some of whom are represented in the Committee—who signed the Select Committee report, which says:
<br><blockquote><p>"We are not convinced that the evidence presented to date justifies discrimination against the former spouses of fire-fighters, teachers, soldiers, civil servants, nurses, police officers and others covered by the public service schemes … We recommend that the Bill should be amended to extend to former spouses of members of unfunded public service schemes the same right of choosing how to take a pension transfer."</p></blockquote>
Will my hon. Friend ask the Minister about that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will indeed.<br><br>
The Minister might say that not many people will want to transfer out of the unfunded public sector schemes, but the right exists for members of those schemes to transfer. If there are circumstances in which it is in the interest of those members to transfer, they should not a priori have that right or have the opportunity to exercise it. However, many people do exercise that right because it makes a great deal of sense to transfer to and buy years in another occupational pension scheme instead of remaining as referred members of a public service pension scheme. Many people have taken advice and transferred from unfunded public sector pension schemes into the House of Commons scheme. It is not true that that is necessarily bad. If it is sometimes good for individuals to transfer, it must be in the interests of those members whose membership derives from a pension split.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes the point with her own testimony. As an intelligent and experienced person, she will have made the decision in a well-advised and considered way. If it is right for her to do it because she was, through her work, a member of a public sector scheme, it must be equally right for someone whose membership of a scheme derives from a pension split. It is invidious to prevent that from happening.<br><br>
Discrimination is bad in all circumstances, but it is especially nefarious, obnoxious and unacceptable when it derives from a conflict of interests. I accuse the Government of a conflict of interests between their obligations to be just to the citizenry as a whole when they draft legislation and the narrow interest of the Treasury, which drives the Social Security Front Bench. We read in <i>The Times</i> today that the Chancellor is not even satisfied with pulling the strings behind the stage, but is about to make a takeover bid for the whole show.<br><br>
If the Minister wishes to clear our minds of the black suspicion that we harbour about the reasons for the Government's lack of even-handedness in this matter, he had better provide some of the explanations that have been strikingly missing from the debate so far.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Conservative party was responsible for pension schemes for 18 years and did nothing to—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That sort of argument is not very productive at this time of night, or indeed at any time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am always grateful to my hon. Friend for his support.<br><br>
Our main objection to the proposal is that to allow transfers out of unfunded public service schemes would cause substantial public expenditure at a cost to the taxpayer. The principle here—something that has been referred to throughout our consideration of the schedule—is that those who are divorcing should meet the cost of the divorce and the divorce should not impose costs on others, including taxpayers. It could cost up to £190 million in the first year. It might not cost that much, it might cost much less, but there is a principle here: the taxpayer should not be faced with additional costs as a consequence of divorce. That is why we were not persuaded by the point that was put to the Social Security Select Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So, the Government's position is that they are introducing this great Bill and bringing justice to women, unless the women in question are unfortunate enough to be married to,
<br><blockquote><p>"firefighters, teachers, soldiers, civil servants, police officers and others covered by the public service schemes."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 464</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The principle is as I have set it out: that it would not be right for divorce to lead to costs that must be met by taxpayers. The principle has run throughout our consideration of the Bill and continues to apply here.<br><br>
Earlier, I drew to the attention of my hon. Friends the distinction between Gainsborough and Beckenham amendments. Most of the amendments have been Gainsborough amendments, in that they have urged us to introduce less pension sharing, but amendment No. 147 is clearly a Beckenham amendment, so I look forward to the hon. Lady's intervention. The point raised by the hon. Member for Gainsborough is contrary to the direction in which he has been encouraging us to go during our previous consideration of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Lait</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has the Minister carried out an assessment of whether the measure would stand up in the European Court in the same way as the Barber judgment, in which cost to other people was an issue, and which was made on the basis of the woman's point of view?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Select Committee acknowledged, there is no great clamour for people to move out of public service schemes because they are generous and, in nearly every case, it would not be in the financial interests of the former spouse to transfer out. Therefore, the measure is highly unlikely to be tested in that way. The pension will be secure. Once in payment, it will be fully protected against inflation, which is in the interests of the former spouse. I do not envisage that this provision will cause very much upset among those affected. I urge the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At this late hour, the Minister seems to have discovered something about pension splitting—it is very expensive and someone ends up suffering. We have been trying to point that out for days. Normally, the person who suffers is a member of the public, who has accumulated his or her pension through hard work. However, the Labour party does not mind about that—it worries only when its Treasury masters tell it that public money might be needed. Frankly, the Labour party's cover is blown and, without further ado, we shall press the amendment to a vote.</span></p>

CHARGES IN RESPECT OF PENSION SHARING COSTS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 146, in page 32, line 37, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(e) provision for the Secretary of State to draw to draw up a scale of recommended charges, following consultation with representatives of the pensions industry and other interested parties.'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take the following amendments: No. 180, in page 32, line 46, leave out
<br><blockquote><p>'is attributed to the transfer'</p></blockquote>
and insert
<br><blockquote><p>'will be divided equally between the transferor and the transferee'.</p></blockquote>
No. 181, in page 33, line 13, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>'(8) In the event of a dispute between either of the parties on the one side and a person or persons responsible for a pension arrangement on the other as to what is a reasonable or acceptable level of costs or charges including legal costs, the decision of the Pensions Ombudsman shall be final.'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a slight difference between amendment No. 146, which suggests that the Secretary of State should
<br><blockquote><p>"draw up a scale of recommended charges"</p></blockquote>
and amendments Nos. 180 and 181, which I shall discuss in a moment and which are the most important amendments of all.<br><br>
Amendment No. 146 is necessary because the charges and costs of pension splitting will almost certainly get out of hand unless appropriate action is taken. We believe that pension splitting should be the exception rather than the rule; the Government appear to believe that it should be the rule rather than the exception. They will thereby be responsible for a fantastic growth in charges and costs—actuarial advice will be necessary and legal arguments will be pursued. On many occasions—with virtually every clause that we have considered—I have drawn attention to the new scope that will be available to increase costs and charges. On previous amendments, we argued that the ombudsman should limit costs and that other appropriate mechanisms should be put in place.<br><br>
With your usual omniscient wisdom, Mr. McWilliam, you grouped amendments Nos. 180 and 182 with amendment No. 146. Amendments Nos. 180 and 181 involve a slightly different matter. They raise
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 466</span>
the last substantive point that we want to make about this section of the Bill and we feel extremely strongly about it. It has been evident from the outset that the whole pension-splitting exercise has been introduced as part of a narrow political agenda, partially what one might call an extreme feminist agenda. I mean feminism not in the sense of believing in the emancipation of women and the removal of artificial obstacles to them in life—I would be the first to support that—but in the sense of a demagogic attempt to argue to a certain section of the electorate that if they vote Labour, they will receive all sorts of special benefits as a result of being female. It is wrong to conduct policy on that basis. If there is to be a case for special protection for special groups of people, it should be for minors—that is, for children and young people. We have made our case for that this morning.<br><br>
The Government have not thought through the provisions of the Bill properly. There has been evidence of that on almost every page and we have drawn attention to it. There is a strand of unfairness—a lack of even-handedness—running through the whole exercise. Nowhere is that more shamelessly evident than in clause 33. I refer hon. Members to subsection (3)(a):
<br><blockquote><p>"where the relevant order or provision includes provision about the apportionment of charges under this section, there is attributable to the party so much of the charge as is apportioned to him by that provision".</p></blockquote>
That means that if the courts have determined the charges, or if they have endorsed an agreement between the parties, which, one hopes will be achievable in most cases, establishing the level and the sharing of charges, the order will provide for that level of charges to be assigned to the parties.<br><br>
Subsection (3)(b), however, contains the kernel of the evil that we wish to remove from the Bill. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"where the relevant order or provision does not include such provision, the charge is attributable to the transferor."</p></blockquote>
The Minister has been making an increasingly feeble attempt—including on the last group of amendments that we discussed—to pretend that there is a degree of even-handedness and justice in the government's approach to the pension-splitting exercise. It is made clear here that there is nothing of the kind. A child of five could see that in a dispute between parties to a pension-sharing deal, if there were no reason for the courts to argue that one side should bear a disproportionate share of the charges, the solution would be to divide those charges equally. The pension is being split—why should the charges not be split accordingly?<br><br>
The Government's agenda comes to the fore here, rearing its ugly head above the surface, stating that in such cases,
<br><blockquote><p>"the charge is attributable to the transferor."</p></blockquote>
The transferor will not necessarily be a man, it may be a woman. I mentioned earlier the case of a person known to me, a very well paid and successful woman, whose husband is a "no-good-'un," as I think the old-fashioned phrase goes. In the event of a divorce, she will lose out to someone who is a drunk, who has atacked her and who has another girl friend on whom he will spend any money that he has, if he does not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0726">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 467</span>
spend it in the pub. He will walk away with a large share not only of her current assets, but of her accumulated pension. In those circumstances if there were an acrimonious divorce, insult would be added to injury because she would be told that she must also pay the costs. He would not even have to pay the proportionate costs for the actuaries and lawyers out of his share of the proceeds.<br><br>
The provision will not handicap and burden only men. It will disproportionately handicap, burden and penalise the transferor—the person defined as the one who has earned the pension. There is no rhyme, reason or justice to this. I am glad that it is the last substantive point on this section of this appalling Bill. It symbolises and summarises the essence of the Bill's unpleasant shortcomings, to which we have objected all along, in a manner that is transparent to anyone with the slightest sense of natural justice. It is wrong and, by definition, is not even-handed. As even-handed drafting of the clause would have stated that, if agreement cannot be reached, the charge should be split on a 50:50 basis. Instead, the clause states that, where there is doubt, the transferor will be penalised and the transferee will benefit. That is a rotten principle in a rotten Bill. This badly conceived proposal has been vitiated throughout by the Government's appalling lack of regard for elementary fairness and justice.</span></p>
<p>9.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All the clauses seek to create fairness where fairness does not currently exist.<br><br>
With regard to amendment No. 146, the Government intend to use regulations to set out which charges will be recoverable, the activities for which charges may be made and the need for charges to be reasonable and to be set out at the start of the process. In preparing the regulations, we shall consult interested parties on content and the best way to secure those intentions. The National Association of Pension Funds has already expressed a willingness to draw up a recommended scale of charges for its members. That is a helpful offer and we shall consult further with its representatives.<br><br>
However, it would be inappropriate for the Government to recommend the level of charges for pension sharing. A statutory scale would need to cover a large range of scales for different types of pension arrangements—including, for example, those at the exotic end of the personal pensions market—or to be so broad as to be virtually worthless. It is better to ensure adequate avenues of redress in the event of a dispute, rather than to legislate in detail.<br><br>
If a complaint cannot be resolved by the schemes' dispute resolution procedures, the Pensions Advisory Service may be able to help. Where a matter remains unresolved, the pensions ombudsman can hear complaints of maladministration against pension schemes and, where appropriate, ensure redress. His decision is binding on the parties to a dispute, but either party will retain the right of appeal to the High Court on a point of law.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 468</span>
On Amendment No. 181, a dispute between a solicitor or barrister and his client on, say, legal costs, will fall within the remit of the legal services ombudsman rather than the pensions ombudsman.<br><br>
With regard to amendment No. 180, the Government believe that the apportionment of charges should be determined by the courts or the couple concerned. The pension-sharing order or agreement will specify the proportion of the costs that the parties to the divorce will have to meet. That is in line with the treatment of costs for other assets on divorce, from which we see no reason to depart.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the most complete cop-out of all. The Minister has failed to deal with subsection (3)(b), which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"where the relevant order or provision does not include such provision, the charge is attributable to the transferor."</p></blockquote>
I have said that we do not object to a court making a particular allocation where account has been taken of the arguments advanced on behalf of the two parties. We believe in civil justice. I have also said that we have no wish to override any agreement reached by parties on the distribution of costs. It is perfectly right that such agreements should proceed.<br><br>
However, the Committee must consider what will happen when no such agreement is reached. By definition, there is no agreement in an acrimonious divorce. Subsection (3)(b) makes it clear that, in such a circumstance, the costs will be borne entirely by the transferor, but in summing up the Minister pretended that that subsection did not exist. He did not attempt to justify it—he ignored it. If that is the point at which I sit down, having said that I rest my case, my case must rest there.<br><br>
I have no difficulty with the Minister's comments on amendment No. 146. I am pleased to hear that the National Association of Pension Funds has agreed to help draw up a set of specified charges. That is good news and a sensible way forward. I shall withdraw amendment No. 146, which has more than served its purpose in eliciting that response.<br><br>
Our discussion of amendments Nos. 180 and 181, however, has revealed indefensible injustice, lack of even-handedness, unfairness and penalisation of the transferor for no reason other than that he is a transferor. No defence has been made against those charges—the Minster sought to pretend that there was not a problem. There is a problem in the Bill and we shall attempt to ensure that it does not remain. Therefore, I shall press amendments Nos. 180 and 181 to a vote.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Leigh</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely this matter can be dealt with on Report. It is unfair that, under the Bill, someone who has built up a pension and is going through a divorce will automatically incur all the costs unless there is an agreement. The Minister must realise that that is unfair and that there is room for improvement. The courts should divide the costs equally. The Minister may not want to reply now, but surely he should offer to reconsider the matter.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0727">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 469</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timms</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have pointed out that, in normal circumstances, that question will be resolved by agreement between the two parties or by the court order. Where it is not resolved by the court, the relevant subsection will act as a default option to allow a pension scheme to recover the costs from the transferor only—that is in the unlikely event that the order does not specify otherwise and the agreement does not resolve the matter. I would refer hon. Members to the comments of the Association of British Insurers on recovery of costs in such exceptional circumstances. It stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"We strongly support this approach to the apportionment of the administrative costs of pension sharing, which should not be imposed on other scheme members or policyholders."</p></blockquote>
That is absolutely right and that is why I stand by the Bill's proposal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is another irrelevancy and another cop-out. First, no one is suggesting that the costs should be borne by other scheme members. Ths issue is whether they should be borne by the transferor or the transferee, or shared between them. Secondly, it is unrealistic to say that in the majority of cases the matter will be resolved by agreement between the parties. Sadly, divorce is acrimonious in all too many cases. Even when it would not otherwise be acrimonious, the legal advisers of the parties tend to ensure that it is, because they argue as aggressively as possible for what they perceive to be the interests of their clients. That is how the divorce system works in this country. That may be regrettable, but it is a fact that we must acknowledge.<br><br>
Furthermore, it is unlikely that the courts will want to assess the matter. That will require further court time and Parliament will already have appeared to indicate that, where there is any doubt or where no explicit agreement exists between the parties, the transferor should pay the costs. That seems to be the signal that the Government want Parliament to send to the courts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flight</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There seems to be a pretence that there will be a problem in recovering the money from persons other than the transferor. As the money goes from the pension scheme to the spouse, I cannot see any practical problem in recovering pari passu from transfer on spouse.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot agree more with my hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs. The money is clearly there and it would be as easy to deduct half of the costs from each side as to deduct all the costs from one side. The Minister does not claim that it is fair and reasonable for the transferor to pay all the costs, but he does not argue the reverse either. The Minister is clearly on the run—he has not produced a single justification. Perhaps my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury can suggest a justification, but none occurs to me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brazier</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As usual, my hon. Friend is being too lenient on Ministers. The explanation is straightforward. A default option would be involved if no agreement were signed. The proposal is a means of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 470</span>
coercing people who think that the arrangement is manifestly unreasonable into signing, because they would otherwise face a huge legal bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There may be an element of that. The clause is an example of the fact that no concept of justice or fairness has informed any part of the Bill's drafting. Anyone who reads the Bill will realise that it carries the hallmark of unfairness.<br><br>
If the amendment is not accepted and if we cannot introduce further amendments on Report or in another place, the Bill will be a disgrace. It will be referred to in our legal system, and in other countries that are aware of our system, as a monument to poor drafting and an example of injustice. It will reek in the annals of our constitutional history for a long time. The Minister brought a bad piece of legislation before the Committee. This pernicious Bill should not be allowed to proceed in its present form. We find little consolation in the fact that the Government are bound to regret it in time. They should be thoroughly ashamed of their handiwork. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
