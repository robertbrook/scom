MINIMUM CROWN SHAREHOLDING</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Amendment proposed</i> [<i>this day</i>]: No. 6, in page 8, line 15, leave out '25' and insert '15'.—[<i>Mr. Streeter.</i>]</p>
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking amendment No. 12, in page 8, line 17, after 'continues', insert
<br><blockquote><p>'for a period not exceeding five years'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development (Mr. George Foulkes)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At the end of this morning's sitting there was some confusion about the 25 per cent. shareholding. I must accept my share of the responsibility for that misunderstanding. For the benefit of the Committee and for the record, I shall make the position clear. As I mentioned earlier, the golden share contains rights over several important matters, such as the investment policy, the right to appoint the two directors and the ability to stop alterations to various provisions of the company's memorandum of understanding and articles of association. Therefore, it was considered that the market would respond more positively to the Government's retention of such rights through the golden share if the Government also maintained a substantial economic interest in the Commonwealth Development Corporation through their ordinary shareholding.<br><br>
During this morning's sitting, I described the importance of that substantial economic interest. A shareholding of 25 per cent. was chosen because it was thought to be the appropriate minimum figure to constitute a substantial interest. It is, for example, the level around which an ordinary shareholder could block a special resolution under the Companies Act 1985. Therefore, it constitutes what might be considered to be a significant minority shareholding.<br><br>
As the hon. Member for South-West Devon (Mr. Streeter) rightly said, it is not an exact figure—sometimes a 75 per cent. vote is needed to pass a resolution. However, there is no direct or formal link; we are aware that a 25 per cent. shareholding will not block a special resolution—more than 25 per cent. would be required for that. The percentage has been chosen intentionally. The Secretary of State has the powers that she requires as part of the rights that attach to the special share, which are clearly specified in the articles of association, so the Government do not intend to vote using the ordinary shareholding
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 78</span>
other than in exceptional circumstances. I hope that I have now made the position clear.<br><br>
Last week, the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) asked about the retirement age of directors. Following her comments I gave a commitment to consider that matter, and we have done so. The article to which she referred simply reflects a requirement on all public companies under section 293 of the Companies Act 1985. However, I am glad to say that that Act is being reviewed. If she wants to pursue such matters, she could do so in that more general context.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Cheryl Gillan <span class='memberconstituency'>(Chesham and Amersham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for pointing out that that provision is a requirement under the Companies Act 1985. However, as that Act is being reviewed, perhaps the Minister could arrange for it to be amended in the way that I suggested. That would show that ageism is being stamped out by the Government, whatever the political nature.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not within the power of this Committee to amend the Companies Act 1985 in relation to all companies. If the hon. Lady and her colleagues want to pursue that matter, it would be better to do so in a wider context, given that the Government are reviewing that Act.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gary Streeter <span class='memberconstituency'>(South-West Devon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying the position of the Government's shareholding. We do not intend to press these amendments to a Division and, therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN, <i>being of the opinion that the principle of the clause and any matters arising thereon had been adequately discussed in the course of debate on the amendments proposed thereto, forthwith put the Question, pursuant to Standing Orders Nos. 68 and 89,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill:—</p>

TREASURY CONSENT</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir David Madel <span class='memberconstituency'>(South-West Bedfordshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to say a few words on what I regard as the Treasury control clause. The list of what cannot be done without Treasury consent is pretty long.<br><br>
I have always thought that the country was overzealously controlled by the Treasury. Receipts from council house sales cannot be spent, arguably because one could not do so without somehow upsetting the public sector borrowing requirement. However, I have never understood why such money cannot be spent straight away on the housing market. I know that that is outside the scope of the Bill, but it is an example of Treasury control.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0239">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 79</span>
I want to deal with two points on the clause. Subsection (1)(d) states that the Treasury must give consent before the Secretary of State can make
<br><blockquote><p>"a determination under section 9(3), 10(6) or 15(3)".</p></blockquote>
Clause 9 appears to be a condition whereby the Secretary of State might want to make an emergency loan to the corporation or an associated company. However, clause 9(2) states that
<br><blockquote><p>"The Treasury may issue to the Secretary of State out of the National Loans Fund sums required for loans under this section."</p></blockquote>
That is a bit vague. Even if the Treasury said, "All right, you can have a certain sum of money for the loan," would the Secretary of State have to go back to the Treasury to get final clearance that the money provided from the national loans fund was acceptable as an emergency loan?<br><br>
There is no doubt in clause 9(3) as to who is in charge of repayments. It states that they shall be made
<br><blockquote><p>"(a) at such times,</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(b) by such methods, and</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(c) with interest paid at such rates and at such times,</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>as the Secretary of State shall determine from time to time."</p></blockquote>
There is no question in that subsection of the Secretary of State having to get permission from the Treasury to determine what he or she wants to do.<br><br>
Clause 10(6) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"A guarantee under subsection (1) or (3) may be given on such terms and in such manner as the Treasury or the Secretary of State may determine."</p></blockquote>
That is interesting. Has the Treasury suddenly relaxed its control and said to the Secretary of State, "You decide that," or will it insist that it has a veto? What happens if there is no agreement? There is some vagueness that should be cleared up.<br><br>
Clause 15(3) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"For the purposes of this section equivalents in sterling shall be calculated as determined by the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
There is no argument about that: it is entirely for the Secretary of State to determine, without reference to the Treasury. However, as we think that we are escaping from the clutches of the Treasury, clause 21(2) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Treasury's consent—
<ol>
<li>may be general or specific, and</li>
<li>may be conditional or unconditional."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
Talk about a catch-all situation! It is almost like Mao Tse-Tung's "100 flowers" speech, when suddenly China felt that there would be a great degree of liberalism, but all the power was taken back to the centre.<br><br>
There is some mystery and vagueness in clause 21. I can see what the argument is about and where it comes from, but the points that I have raised are worthy of the Minister's comments before we proceed with the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bowen Wells <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hertford and Stortford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: One point mystifies me. Under clause 21(1)(c), the Treasury and the Department for International Development
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 80</span>
will continue to have the capacity to lend to the new public corporation. Will the repayment—both the capital and interest—of such a loan go to the Department for International Development to add to the amount of money that it already has available, or will capital be repaid to the Treasury and the interest to the Department for International Development, as happened at one time? I should be grateful if the Minister would clarify the position?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Secretary of State for International Development (Clare Short)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Maxton. I am very pleased to be back in the Committee. I am grateful to the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Sir D. Module) for trying to protect my Department from the Treasury's grip, but I can assure the Committee that the situation is not as bad as it seems.<br><br>
The clause groups together all the issues that require Treasury consent. Grouping them together, rather than dealing with them separately clause by clause, which is a question of drafting style, appears to emphasise the number and the control. In each case, we have considered whether consent should be required before including them.<br><br>
Let us take in turn the points that have been made. Loan funds properly require Treasury consent. It is a national loan fund, and in any well-run Administration, we would all agree that if different Departments are to lend money to outside organisations, there must be some control over the amounts involved. That is appropriate and quite normal practice in all Governments. I understand that that will arise only in the interim transition period, and that there will be no question of loans from the loan fund after the company has been restructured. There will then be a possibility for it to borrow, but not from the Treasury loan fund. At present, the CDC borrows money from the loan fund with Treasury approval, and that arrangement will stay in place until we have a balance sheet and a totally restructured company.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman referred to the interest paid, the rate and the time, as determined by the Secretary of State. We are replicating the current arrangements for the transition period.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wells</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, there will be three stages. The first is when the company is formed with £50,000 capital, and totally owned by the Government. The second stage is when there is a balance sheet and a profit and loss account, and the company is still wholly owned by the Government. Is the Secretary of State saying that at that stage, the corporation will cease to have the capacity to borrow from the Treasury? If so, it will have no other way of borrowing. It cannot borrow in the private market because it is still owned by the Government. I think that the Secretary of State is saying that it is only when the Government have divested themselves of 75 per cent. of the shares, that the corporation can borrow from the private market. Is that right?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Clare Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right about the three phases. In the period when the balance sheet is put in place, we will make decisions on how soon to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0240">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 81</span>
sell, depending on the strength of the balance sheet and the emerging markets. As the hon. Gentleman knows, the market will be judged at the time. There will be a possibility of borrowing in that intervening period, if it is thought desirable. There might be a time when either would be possible. Logically, that must be right; by the time we get to stage three, the borrowing would be from the private sector. Of course, the Department and the Government could put more resources into the company, but they would do that in the normal way.<br><br>
4.45 pm<br><br>
I return to the points raised by the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire. As now, the Secretary of State would set down the interest rates and repayments of such loans. The two provisions for the transition period that we have just discussed are exactly the arrangements that are in place now. The hon. Gentleman drew attention to the power under clause 10(6), which allows a guarantee to be given by the Treasury or by the Secretary of State. Under that provision, if it is a guarantee to the CDC, it will be a guarantee for an associated company. The terms would depend on who is giving the guarantee, but Treasury consent would be required in either case. It is not as absolute an alternative as it might seem.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman said, quite rightly, that the Secretary of State for International Development is given the power under clause 15(3) to determine the exact equivalent rate in sterling. That is not a difficult task, but the values of the various currencies vary because we operate in many different markets. The Treasury is willing to trust the Department for International Development with that discretion. The hon. Gentleman may think that, because we have grouped all the powers together, it seems to be an iron hand; but it replicates a perfectly sensible set of existing powers.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr. Wells) asked whether repayment of capital and interest would go to the Department for International Development while the Government continue to loan to the CDC. That will depend on where we are at. As the hon. Gentleman knows, much of the money owed to the Department for International Development will be restructured on the balance sheet into an equity holding. The interest paid might end up going back into an equity stake in the company. The capital repayment of Treasury loans comes through the Department for International Development, and the interest goes to the consolidated fund. If the loan is from the national loans fund, it will all go back to that fund. I wish to make another logical point: when we structure the balance sheet, there will come a point at which loans that are owing to the Department will be converted into equity. It will therefore become a stakeholding in the company, and will not be taken as a repayment to the Department.<br><br>
I hope that that is clear. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford for trying to protect the Department from too much Treasury intervention, but I have to say that our working relationship with the Treasury is good. Our settlement in the comprehensive spending review was satisfactory.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 82</span>
We kept it rather quiet, but we got the biggest increase of any Department. On top of that, we run a joint office in Washington, and our executive directors go to the International Monetary Fund and the World bank: the bank being serviced from our Department, the IMF from the Treasury. That collaboration is good.</span></p>
<p>4.49 pm</p>
<p><i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>
<p>5.4 pm</p>
<p><i>On resuming</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Clare Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was bringing my remarks to an end by saying that I was extremely grateful to the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire for his concern that the Department should not be dominated by the Treasury. Because all the powers are grouped together, it seems to dominate more than it actually does. In fact, it replicates existing, entirely sensible arrangements. The Department's relations with the Treasury are very good, which is healthy both for our budget and for our collaboration, especially with Washington, in the International Monetary Fund and the World bank. That makes us more influential as a Government, because we have a united commitment to our development efforts and our influence in the fund. I hope that the Committee is assured that the powers are necessary, sensible and replicate existing arrangements, and that the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire is assured that the dead hand of the Treasury will not harm the purposes that lie behind the Bill.</span></p>

HOUSE OF COMMONS DISQUALIFICATION, &C</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir David Madel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make just a small point. During our proceedings last Thursday, we discussed disqualification, and the Minister said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I have yet to check the position of Members of the European Parliament, so I shall come back to the hon. Lady"</p></blockquote>
—my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham—
<br><blockquote><p>"about that."—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee D,</i> 17 June 1999; c. 25.]</p></blockquote>
I understand that Members of the House, Members of the Scottish Parliament and Members of the Welsh and Northern Ireland Assemblies are disqualified. Members of the European Parliament should be disqualified, too. Those who have been newly elected have more than enough to do in putting right what has so manifestly gone wrong over there. That is not an anti-European statement. I hope that the Minister will confirm that they cannot serve either.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I confirm that, under the same provisions as disqualify Members of this Parliament, Members of the European Parliament are disqualified. Powers for disqualification exist in relation to Members of the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh

Assembly, but those powers would have to be used by the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly. Those bodies will therefore have to consider those powers to decide whether their Members are also disqualified. All members of the board that the Secretary of State appoints will be disqualified during the transition period, but after the sale, only the two whom the Secretary of State appoints will be disqualified in the way that I described.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir David Madel</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government have powers of suggestion. Can we take it that they will suggest to the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly that those bodies pass whatever legislation is necessary to ensure that their Members are disqualified?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For consistency, it would seem right that, if Members of this Parliament and of the European Parliament are excluded, Members of the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly should also be excluded. We shall consider the hon. Gentleman's suggestion, and decide whether we should discuss the matter with our colleagues in the Scottish Parliament, when they take over on 1 July, and with the Welsh Assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wells</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister explain his point about the two directors that the Secretary of State appoints after the sale? Will the CDC board appoint its own directors—other than those two—thereafter? Will the Government appoint all directors before that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At the point of transformation, the Secretary of State will appoint all directors, all of whom will be disqualified in the way that I described earlier. After the sale, only the two directors that the Secretary of State appoints will be disqualified.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wells</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Once the company is sold, and the Secretary of State appoints two directors, will disqualification lapse? The other members of the board could be appointed from those disqualified under the clause.</span></p>

SHORT TITLE, EXTENT AND COMMENCEMENT</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Clare Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 9, in page 11, line 28, leave out subsection (3).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 8, in page 11, line 29, after 'until' insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(a) the Commonwealth Heads of Government have given their approval; and</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(b)'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Clare Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Under amendment No. 9, we shall leave out subsection (3), which was reasonably added by the House of Lords and provides that any Act resulting from the Bill should not come into force until the Secretary of State has laid before the House a statutory instrument making such provision for the CDC's tax liability as will encourage private investment and the House of Commons has approved it. It was perfectly reasonable for the Lords to do that, given that we had made a commitment to introduce those provisions but had not yet done so. As the Committee knows, we are doing so today and will be discussing them shortly. Therefore, the provision should be removed from the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government amendment has been grouped with amendment No. 8, which is simple and straightforward. It is designed to act as a vehicle to enable us to probe the sort of consultation that the Government have had with the various elements throughout the Commonwealth. The history of the CDC is long and honourable, as has been highlighted on many occasions in debate. The CDC is admired by all parties. It has obviously sprung up from the Commonwealth and our desire to help those countries that are not so well developed as ours. What consultation has the Secretary of State had with our partners around the world?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Clare Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady for what she says. I thought that amendment No. 8 was a probing amendment because it would mean that the British Parliament would not have the power to modify our arrangements for the CDC without the consent of the Head of Government of every Commonwealth country. I did not believe that the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0242">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 85</span>
hon. Lady would mean to do that; it would involve a new concept of the sovereignty of Parliament.<br><br>
The Prime Minister announced the Government's intention to establish this public-private partnership to increase private investment through the CDC in developing countries at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Edinburgh in October 1997, and that announcement was well received. We have not held formal consultations or asked for approval, but we declared our intention very early on and made all the details clear to the Commonwealth Heads of Government. The general view is that the CDC is treasured and especially valued in countries that receive little investment from overseas. There is genuine anxiety to increase investment, especially from those in the private sector, so there is broad approval for the proposal. We have not had detailed consultation, but we have put it before them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has the Secretary of State received any representation from any Government outside the United Kingdom, or any organisation or company in which the CDC invests? Has there been any interest at all from such quarters, or any comment on the proposals? I should be surprised if there had not been, but if there was not, to what would she attribute that sad lack of input?</span></p>
<p>5.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Clare Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There has been a lot of interaction and interest from similarly structured organisations. Other public sector development investment organisations—Germany and the Netherlands have them, and another is an arm of the World Bank—are watching developments closely and are extremely interested. If we succeed in our objectives and increase investment in certain countries, they might think of making similar arrangements.<br><br>
I occasionally receive representations for specific CDC investments from Government when a good word is wanted, but I have not received any representations whatever about the Bill from countries in the Commonwealth or companies in which the CDC invests. We have strengthened our development relationship with Commonwealth countries and we broadly welcome the proposition that there can be an increase in private sector investment through the CDC and some restructuring. Nevertheless, I have not received such representations. I shall be absolutely accurate. I have met many Heads of Government from such countries and talked about development and the need for investment with them, but no one has made any direct representations on the changes that the Bill will make.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Clare Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 10, in page 11, line 33, leave out subsection (4).<br><br>
Clause 27(4) states that:
<br><blockquote><p>"Nothing in this Act shall impose any charge on the people or public funds".</p></blockquote>
Those words were inserted by a privileged amendment in the House of Lords, because it is a privilege of the House of Commons to control charges on public funds. Now that the Bill is back in the Commons, the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 86</span>
subsection is no longer necessary and therefore it is a technical matter to remove it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wells</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What does the Secretary of State expect to provide for the CDC? The clause states that:
<br><blockquote><p>"Nothing in this Act shall impose any charge on the people or public funds",</p></blockquote>
but in the Department for International Development's estimates, in annex 1 on page 141, it is clear that the Government expect to contribute £3 million this year and £1 million in the subsequent years 1999–2000, 2000–01 and 2001–02. That will be a charge on people and public funds.<br><br>
Will the Secretary of State explain what the Department had in mind when it made those estimates, and whether the Department, on an estimated basis, intends to provide additional loans or grants to the CDC to carry out a purpose of which we have no knowledge?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Clare Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is on a much narrower point, which is to debar the other place from discussing the spending of public moneys. All that we are doing is to remove that, as we can properly discuss such matters now that the Bill is back in the House of Commons.<br><br>
I cannot give the hon. Gentleman detailed figures in response to his question. We expect to continue to support the CDC during the transition period as we do now, but we need the power to do so. As he knows, we shall then move into the period of transition, but no one knows exactly how long that will be. Until we have the new balance sheet, we shall make provision to behave as we do now. We shall then have the sale. I therefore cannot comment on the detailed figures, but I can certainly obtain a commentary for the hon. Gentleman. We shall continue to do that until the sale, when the public-private partnership will be in place.</span></p>

<p>'. Schedule <i>(Tax)</i> shall have effect.'.—[<i>Clare Short.</i>]</p>
<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Clare Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move that the clause be read a Second time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to discuss the following: Government amendment No. 13 and Government new schedule 1—Tax.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Clare Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At last, we come to the provisions on tax. I hope that hon. Members found useful the briefing notes provided by the Department and the notes provided today that record the Department's verbal briefing.<br><br>
The clause serves only to give effect to the new schedule. New schedule 1 sets out all the details of the proposed tax treatment for the CDC. The overall aim of the proposal is to provide the CDC with a level playing field in relation to competitors located outside the United Kingdom, so that it can achieve its goal of investing in developing countries, using private capital
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0243">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 87</span>
raised in the context of a competitive private investment market. It does not seek to give the CDC anything more than that.<br><br>
The key element of the new schedule is that, unless the partnership were to end, the CDC's income and chargeable gains—and the CDC's only—would not be chargeable to UK corporation tax, capital gains tax or income tax. The CDC would remain liable to applicable local taxes, as at present, and investors in the CDC would be liable to tax on their income and gains according to their own circumstances. It is also intended that where the CDC undertakes activities other than investment, such as investment management, that would be undertaken through a separate subsidiary, and be subject to tax in the normal way. I might return later to the comments of the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) on that matter.<br><br>
The schedule makes the detailed provisions. I hope that the Committee will agree that it is a clear, strong way of enabling the CDC to meet the Government's objective of increasing private-sector investment in the poorest countries, which have difficulty in attracting private-sector investment without going offshore. It is a major instrument of British development policy, and it should not go offshore. I note that the <i>Hansard</i> report of the first sitting suggested that I said that the Cayman islands would have been acceptable but that it was not available. I did not say that. I said that it was suggested to us that the CDC could have gone to the Cayman islands, just as it could have gone to Ireland, but that I thought that it was completely inappropriate.<br><br>
We want a simple, level playing field. The CDC should be able to raise funds from the private sector and not be disadvantaged by the fact that it is onshore and thus liable to tax. That would make it unable to compete with private-sector investment organisations, which are offshore because of the better tax arrangements. That is the purpose of the new schedule. I hope that we have achieved it and I hope that the Committee will agree that it is a desirable objective.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Streeter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State will be pleased to know that the Committee supports the aim of ensuring that the CDC has a level playing field. However, subject to further discussion, the Opposition do not support the way in which it is achieved. First, however, I must tell the Committee that we were pleased with many of the Government's replies to our questions and that we appreciate the helpful spirit that has been forthcoming. It has certainly helped to ease our concerns on a number of matters. However, we have now come to a matter on which we may well disagree, and we shall need to debate it carefully. I was grateful for the briefing session yesterday and for the notes that we received this afternoon.<br><br>
In essence, the new provisions mean that, on a day to be decided, the new CDC will become exempt from corporation tax, which includes the income and capital gains of corporations. That will presumably happen on the day that the CDC becomes subject to the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 88</span>
private sector when 75 per cent. of its share capital has been sold or disposed of. Therefore, the provisions are powerful; they mean that the CDC will not pay tax on its profits in this country. So far as I know—perhaps the Secretary of State can confirm or deny this—that is unique in the history of private companies in this country. I am not aware of a Government legislating for a special tax position for a private company, which the CDC will be. That is a matter of some interest, which we must consider very carefully.<br><br>
It is fair to say that, in effect, the provisions will make the CDC a tax exile in its own country. I suppose the Government's implicit admission is that the arrangement—we are told that it is a public-private partnership—will work, and we all hope that it does, only if such an artificial tax provision is put in place. Therefore, it is important to probe the provisions carefully.<br><br>
Until we hear more, we think that the arrangement is artificial and inappropriate and sets an alarming precedent. The real problem is that there is an easier way of doing what the Government want to do. As I have said, we support the aim of giving the CDC a level playing field, but I should like the Secretary of State to say why she thinks that going offshore is inappropriate.<br><br>
We have heard that there will be no objection to the investors in the CDC being from overseas. All its investors might be from overseas, which is not a problem. We already know that the CDC's activity is, by definition, overseas and offshore—that is its sphere of influence. The CDC's profits will be generated overseas from its investments there, yet we are told that it is absolutely essential that while the Secretary of State retains a shareholding in the company it should be a United Kingdom tax-resident company incorporated in this country.<br><br>
At yesterday's briefing session, we learnt that in the event—we were told this morning that it is an unlikely, but none the less provision is made for it in the Bill—of the Secretary of State disposing of her shareholding in due course, the tax exemption would end and the CDC would have seven years to restructure itself. It would effectively have seven years to go offshore so that it would not be subject to United Kingdom tax in future. Therefore, the Government think it perfectly acceptable for the CDC, which will invest in companies overseas, to go offshore once the Government cease to have a minority shareholding in it. So it is only the Government's involvement that causes the Secretary of State to say that it is inappropriate for the CDC to go offshore.<br><br>
I am not one to support some of the dreadful tax evasion that has happened in this country over the past 100 years. As has been said, I used to specialise in company law and used to set up offshore companies in the Channel islands—a perfectly legitimate activity. If a company is trading overseas and its profits are generated largely overseas, it is perfectly legitimate for its tax base to be outside the United Kingdom, so that it is not subject to United Kingdom corporation tax. There is nothing spivvish or unpatriotic in that—it is part of the world that we live in today.<br><br>

I have been checking the Prime Minister's speeches, seeking to learn all that I can from him, and he often speaks about the global society in which we all live, saying that it is vital that Britain should never be isolated and that we must play our part in the global interdependence of the 21st century. "Global interdependence" are the buzz words. Why, then, is the Government's attitude to the issue so "little Englander"? Why is retaining the company in the United Kingdom so important when the Government have only 25 per cent. ownership? Will the Secretary of State explain that to the Committee? It must be more than, "Well, it just doesn't feel right." To set up an artificial, unique tax structure for one privately-owned structure requires substantial justification from the Secretary of State.<br><br>
5.30 pm<br><br>
We know that overseas investors will be welcome, as overseas activities are part and parcel of the company's business. Why is it so important that it is based in the United Kingdom? It is not merely a question of going to the Cayman islands, which conjures up a romantic, mystic, drug-trafficking—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Clare Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Sleazy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Streeter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Sleaze and I do not go hand in hand. It is not only the Cayman islands; the Channel islands would do the job. There is no reason why the company cannot be incorporated in Jersey. The Channel islands are in this country's sphere of influence; there is no question of their being sleazy or downmarket. Anyone who wants to live in Jersey or Guernsey will discover that it is not sleazy, downmarket or cheap. The Channel islands have a high reputation for integrity in managing offshore funds. They are well worth considering.<br><br>
It has taken a long time to do battle with the Treasury and the Inland Revenue to set up this artificial, unique tax structure. I want the Government's assurance that before marching down that avenue they have explored every offshore possibility in the Channel islands and taken account of the tax haven that they provide. We are worried about setting up a new tax status for one company, because it is not the right thing to do.<br><br>
I shall go further than suggesting that the company is incorporated in the Channel islands. Once a company is set up in the United Kingdom, as we heard at the tax briefing, it is jolly difficult to transfer its assets overseas. As the Bill sets up the company, we should take this opportunity to go offshore.<br><br>
It is better not to wait until the Secretary of State has sold her shares and better not to wait for another seven years; it is better to do it now. Now is the right moment to go offshore, when the company has not yet been created.<br><br>
I hope that substantial thought has been given to the matter. The company can still be subject to the same memorandum, articles of association, business principles, memorandum of understanding and investment principles. The same controls can be put in place, it is simply a matter of having its tax base in a tax haven. I hope that the Secretary of State will give
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 90</span>
us substantial reasons why the Government are not taking that route.<br><br>
I go further: the Government are missing an opportunity. The organisation should go offshore to the Channel islands and significant consideration should be given to moving the administrative headquarters of the CDC out of the United Kingdom and placing it in sub-Saharan Africa. What is wrong with that? Why on earth should the company, whose business is generating employment, prosperity and hope in the pre-emerging markets in the poorest countries of the world not relocate its administrative headquarters to Nairobi or Kampala, for example? There is already a substantial DFID presence there which could happily co-exist with the CDC and send a clear signal to our partners and future partners that we are serious about getting to grips with poverty in the emerging world. Many of us have visited those countries and found poverty which made us nauseous. Going offshore and moving the administration to sub-Saharan Africa for tax reasons sends an important signal, and I hope that the Government have thought about that.<br><br>
Why does the company need fancy buildings in Millbank? They are lavish and excessive, given the nature of the business. I apologise to my hon. Friends who may have been working for the CDC for many years and enjoying those lavish premises, but I wonder if they are appropriate for the 21st century.<br><br>
I ask the Government to consider the matter most carefully. I am not yet satisfied with the explanations that have been given. Far too often, we in the north have imposed our wishes and ideas on the south, so let us now see the CDC go south. Let us set up the company in a tax haven offshore and move its administrative headquarters to sub-Saharan Africa. That would send a powerful signal to the developing world.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wells</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If, as my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Devon urges me to do, I am to vote against this new clause, which will give the CDC tax exemption, it will be out of loyalty to him rather than out of conviction. That argument may develop and I might have another suggestion.<br><br>
The CDC should be tax exempt. Over the years, I have always argued that it was immoral for the British Government to tax its proceeds. It has paid a huge amount of British tax and, as a former employee of the CDC, I was responsible for negotiating tax exemptions in four countries in which it operates. Like the World bank, it enjoys tax exemption in many operating areas overseas. Some recipient countries in which it has developed give it tax exemption, but the home country, from which all the money comes, does not. The result is that the tax paid by the CDC is sometimes far greater than the amount that the Department for International Development invests in it. The Department always objected when I deducted from the CDC's proceeds the tax that the corporation had paid. We had many arguments about that in the past, and some members of the Committee will be aware of them.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0245">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 91</span>
Taxation of the CDC means that it has fewer resources to invest in poor countries. That is absurd. The Treasury indulges in the absurdities that I have already mentioned, and in this case it taxed with one hand and returned the money with some difficulty—and usually after a bloody great argument—to the CDC and to the Department for International Development. That is the crazy world in which the Treasury lives. It has long since needed sorting out.<br><br>
It is absurd for the CDC to be taxed in this country. Therefore, I am in favour of it not being taxed. Clearly, my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Devon also takes that view, but the question is whether it should have an offshore base. That is a perfectly good suggestion to which the Secretary of State will no doubt respond,<br><br>
If the CDC were not tax exempt, it would be at a disadvantage when compared to other private investment companies that operate offshore. They save tax and that enables them to pay dividends to their shareholders, which encourages investment in the company and further investment overseas in emerging countries. We agree with the Secretary of State. We should encourage investment in the poorest regions. Therefore, the CDC must be tax exempt if it is to operate in the way that the Government want it to.<br><br>
I want to ask a few technical questions. The Secretary of State will remember that the CDC's annual accounts this year show that it made a loss. The major cause of that loss was heavy provisioning against losses in its portfolio that resulted from the Asian crisis and the corporation's investments in countries such as Pakistan where there was no question of it being able to remit dividends, interest or capital repayments. There was a reason for those provisions and the corporation got them through its audit. Presumably, the auditors felt that they were justified.<br><br>
What will happen after the CDC gains exemption? The Asian economies have recovered and some CDC investments are worth a lot more than was expected, producing dividends and profits. Therefore those economies must come back into the CDC's accounts on the income side and the advance sheet on the capital side.<br><br>
Are those economies taxed retrospectively because they have come out of revisions, or are those add-backs tax free? If so, the CDC will have undergone an interesting exercise in how it addressed its balance sheet for a particular year.<br><br>
That can be likened to private sector practice. Committee members will probably remember that, when we sold off British Airways, the chairman was greatly criticised for writing off all the planes and practically everything that moved before taking the company into the private sector. He did that to enhance company profits. By saying, in effect, "What a good boy am I", the share price went up.<br><br>
Some questioned the legitimacy of that, but the chairman got away with it. Therefore, Asian economies will get a double benefit, should they be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 92</span>
allowed to add back those provisions and get a tax premium. I do not mind that, as it will make the CDC stronger. However, we must be clear that that procedure will be followed.<br><br>
There will be seven years in which to transfer the assets of the corporation now held in a UK company to the offshore company that will almost certainly be formed, should the CDC be sold from the public sector. I am anxious about that, as there are always legal costs involved in such actions and, quite often, stamp duty is payable.<br><br>
Will stamp duty be paid in the UK and/or other countries? Clearly, if the CDC is in a tax haven, stamp duty will not be paid there. However, it may be payable in the country in which the CDC has invested and which is selling that asset to the offshore company. Tax and stamp duty may be payable on that transfer in countries such as Kenya, Zambia and wherever the CDC invests.<br><br>
Will the Secretary of State seek assurances from countries in which the CDC invests that they will not impose such a tax? Many of those countries will have already given the CDC exemption from tax and perhaps stamp duty. However, we must be clear about that, and I would be grateful for a list of countries which may grant such exemption, or for an assurance from the Secretary of State that the matter will not arise.<br><br>
I have raised two major technical points. The CDC must be tax exempt, if it is to be successful in its new form.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Heath</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the crux of how the Bill will work in practice. Of course, in the other place, that matter was raised many times and at that stage, there was no answer to it. We now have the answers and I am grateful to the Secretary of State for the care that she has taken to provide us with information over the past couple of days. I am sorry that I was unable to attend the briefing: I was attempting to ask a question of the Secretary of State for Defence. Nevertheless, the written briefing was extremely helpful.<br><br>
Not for the first time, the hon. Member for South-West Devon has confused me a little. He takes enormous interest in the prospect of providing island homes for the corporation. I have never been obsessed with islands and their special tax arrangements, although I am curious about why no island off the west-country coast has the tax status that others enjoy.<br><br>
The corporation is a creature of the British Government. It has a shareholding within it, held by a Minister of the Crown, which, although not a majority stakeholding is nevertheless a preferential stakeholding in the sense of being a golden share. It would be inappropriate for the British Crown to invest that stakeholding outside UK sovereign territory. I reject that alternative just as it was rejected by the International Development Committee, ably chaired by the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford. It was clear that some form of unique tax arrangement had to be found if this measure was to succeed.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0246">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 93</span>
5.45 pm<br><br>
The hon. Member for South-West Devon was a little disingenuous in suggesting that the difficulty was the particular nature of the private-public partnership proposed and its ability to attract investment. Of course it is not. It is simply the market that it will be working in, and the fact that others have tax advantages that this company will not have unless a particular arrangement is made. I welcome the proposals to produce a solution to this intractable problem. I have questions about the precise nature of that solution, and it may be something that we need to come back to on Report.<br><br>
I have a number of questions that I should like the Secretary of State to consider now. The first concerns European Union rules and state aid. The briefing quite candidly says that there is always a potential state aid angle in any Government sale. Quite so. There is undoubtedly that thread. But that applies not only to the sale: the Government intend to put this new financing arrangement in place prior to sale when the corporation will still be wholly owned by the Government. Therefore, theoretically it will be trading in competition with other EU-based companies and institutions but on a preferential tax basis. That must surely be under threat of challenge at the very least. If the sale is to be successful, we need rather more solid assurances from the Commission that this matter will not be taken up, and will not prove a difficulty in the crucial period when confidence in the corporation is being built and prior to the sale.<br><br>
We must have some sort of assessment of whether the loss of tax to the Revenue has been quantified. I wholly support the view that that should be done, but we would be failing in our duties as parliamentarians if the Committee were not at least aware in broad terms of the loss of tax to the Revenue that might result from this specific and special treatment of the corporation.<br><br>
My biggest concern relates to the other activities, to which the Secretary of State alluded, that the corporation could undertake and which lie outside the tax-exempt status. It is a very knotty problem. I welcome the prohibition of group membership, as that was too obvious a way of manipulating the assets and the trading activities of a number of companies but, as has been said, the corporation has wholly owned subsidiaries, some of which may not be trading in precisely the terms of the memorandum of understanding or the articles of association of the new company.<br><br>
What about non-exempt activities and new acquisitions by the corporation once it has been put into the private sector? If it acquired a wholly owned company, it would not be entering a group but would be forming its own group. How would the tax authorities deal with any differential asset distribution within that new group formed by the wholly owned subsidiaries within the corporation? If a wholly owned subsidiary were then to be incorporated in the UK, would it benefit from the same tax treatment as the corporation would be subject to under the Bill?<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 94</span>
We then have the matter of the associated companies status under clause 24. Are there any circumstances in which associated companies would also benefit from the beneficial tax treatment? If so, does the Bill provide for the Treasury to veto that, or is the matter in the hands of the Secretary of State for International Development? Although they are safe hands, the Treasury will probably be unhappy with such an open-ended cheque. If some profits are derived from activities that are covered by the Bill and others are not, how will the tax liability be apportioned? Who will be responsible for the audit and apportionment function? Will dividends—liabilities on dividends and tax credits on dividends—be apportioned between the origins of the profits in tax-exempt and non-tax-exempt activities?<br><br>
My last point is about cessation. In the unlikely event of a future British Government no longer wishing to hold the golden share, the tax arrangements would rightly fall. They would fall after seven years. That is a helpful period for a company to make its adjustments. However, the Government would not control the company's activities through the golden share during those seven years. Such circumstances—we all hope that they will not arise—would provide an enormous investment opportunity for a company that wanted a safe place to invest. They would provide a United Kingdom-based tax haven for seven years. In such circumstances, would that company's activities be controlled in any way other than through the articles of association? Perhaps those articles constitute the only prohibition, but they would leave a great deal of latitude for additional activities during a seven-year period, with a profitable tax base that might be unhelpful to the British Exchequer and unsatisfactory for other competing companies. I should be grateful if the Secretary of State would answer some of those questions. We may have to return to others on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wells</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I forgot to mention another item in relation to stamp duty. I should be grateful if the Secretary of State would consider it when she replies to the other points that I made on the subject earlier.<br><br>
The CDC—or possibly the Department of International Development—will be liable for stamp duty when shares in the CDC are issued. When it is initially formed into a company limited by shares that are owned by the Government, I assume that the Government will be exempt from stamp duty. However, I should like confirmation of that.<br><br>
When we reform the balance sheet for sale and investment by private sector investors, will the shares and share certificates attract stamp duty?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Clare Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for South-West Devon is unable to admit that all the special arrangements make the company a genuine public-private partnership. I do not know whether he has a stubborn mind, or whether it is necessary for the purposes of political rhetoric to pretend that we are providing for pure privatisation, and to deny the complex special arrangements such as the golden share, the entrenchment of ethical principles and, most important, arrangements for ensuring that the investment is made in poor countries. That would not

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 95</span>
happen if we were providing for a straight privatisation.<br><br>
The special arrangements make the company unique. It is a genuine public-private partnership—that is not rhetoric. Its uniqueness explains the complex, interesting and new arrangements. There is no other company like it. It attracts attention from similar bodies all over the world. If it works, and provides an entrenched development objective that invests in the poorest countries but receives more from the private sector, we shall have succeeded. However, we shall get into those countries only because we have entrenched the development interests—that is the public sector part of the partnership. It is because it is unique that it needs unique tax treatment. We must accept the reality; this is not just any old company, nor is it an ordinary privatisation.<br><br>
I shall try to answer each of the points that have been raised. The CDC will remain onshore—in Britain—as a major instrument of Britain's development policy in which the Government have a major stake. That is perfectly proper, and all reasonable people would agree with it. It has nothing to do with being a tax exile in one's own country. It is a special, unique development instrument that we regard proudly as part of our development strategy, and we are allowing it to behave in a way that would not be possible if it were subject only to market forces.<br><br>
Because of public interest in the Government's stake, we think that it should be in our country, but it should not be disadvantaged by the fact that offshore arrangements exist. We have made provision for a level playing field, which is what it is all about, and we need to consider the intrinsic nature of the public-private partnership.<br><br>
The hon. Member for South-West Devon may have difficulty understanding that. For ideological reasons, or because of some sort of stubbornness, he cannot understand that this is a unique arrangement and a public-private partnership. The main answer to the hon. Gentleman's question is that we need a unique arrangement because we are talking about a unique body. It will be a proud part of Britain's development efforts, which should be headquartered in our country. However, it should not be disadvantaged by being unable to raise private funds because all private funds go through companies that are headquartered offshore, owing to the more beneficial tax treatment. That is the purpose of the arrangement, which should be clear to anyone who thinks about it.<br><br>
The hon. Member for South-West Devon asked about making provision if the Secretary of State disposes of the shareholding, thus getting a full privatisation. Hon. Members will know that I do not want this to become a privatised organisation; it is a development instrument. Resources are given by the Government to bring development. Under this Administration, there will never be a suggestion of privatisation.<br><br>
Why are we making such provision? The Committee can imagine that I asked that question.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 96</span>
All the provisions in the public-private partnership have been designed to be in the Bill right from the beginning, and are not dependent on political discretion and interference. That is why we have gone to all the trouble to entrench everything and to have it written into the Bill. Anyone who invests in the organisation will understand exactly what the arrangement is, and that the way in which the organisation behaves is not dependent on a different Minister or a different party being in power.<br><br>
Our City advisers suggested that certain considerations at the point of sale by anyone thinking of investing in the CDC would be whether there was likely to be a change of Minister or Government, or a change of view, such as getting rid of the golden share and going for full privatisation. They will assess the risk and judge the likely rate of return. In order to make it an attractive investment, I needed to put the procedure into the Bill so that an assessment of risk could be made. I completely accepted that advice. It was necessary to make provision for something that will never come about under this Administration, so that people would have a clear view of what would happen under a future Government who wanted to privatise the CDC. That is why it is so important that it is laid out clearly.<br><br>
6 pm<br><br>
One of the attractive features of addressing this question is that the enormous difficulty of privatising becomes clear to everyone, even people who are absolutely ideologically committed. Without the clever approach of creating a new company without having to transfer all its assets in foreign companies, anyone who tried to move the CDC offshore would have to undertake a fantastic legal and organisational job that would take a very long time.<br><br>
When provisions are made in an attempt to begin privatisation, they trigger a realisation that it is enormously difficult organisationally, which in turn makes it massively improbable. No hon. Member can bind future Governments or Parliaments and make it impossible for them to privatise, but the very nature of the organisation under discussion means that privatisation would be a difficult and complex task. Anyone who wanted to take the company offshore to change it would have to make arrangements for the ownership of its every asset to be changed over in the jurisdiction where it is owned, which would take a lot of time.<br><br>
The seven-year exemption period specified in the provisions was judged to be necessary in respect of people investing before a future Administration might decide to make a change, so that they can have a reasonable sense of the likely returns on their investment. In addition, any process of change will take a considerable time. That has the attractive feature that privatising the body would be enormously difficult organisationally, which is delightful.<br><br>
The provision had to be in place for City reasons, and so that people could make a proper assessment of risk. That is why it is there, but it becomes clear to everyone who works through the details that privatisation is an unattractive and difficult option.

It is therefore very unlikely to occur under any successful Administration, but who knows?<br><br>
The hon. Member for South-West Devon supports Britain's development commitment and its moral duty to work for development throughout the world and for the reduction of poverty for the poorest people. He tried to suggest that we were being little Englanders for wanting to house in this country a company that is meant to encourage more investment in developing countries, and which is led by our Government who have a major stake in it. I think not. How can an instrument of our moral duty to promote development in the poorest countries of the world not be housed in our country? How can a company in which the Government have a major share be based somewhere else? If the hon. Gentleman does not understand that, then he does not understand it, but I think that most people with good will and common sense would do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Streeter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does not the Secretary of State accept that what makes us proud of the CDC is not the country in which it is based, but its terrific heritage, and the fact that we have supported it and allowed it to flourish for more than 50 years? Primarily, we are proud of what it achieves. The Opposition want the company to compete on a level playing field with other offshore funds that are active in this marketplace. Is not it sensible to compete with offshore companies by going offshore? Is not the thing that we are proud of not so much whether the company is based in Millbank, Manchester, Middlesbrough or anywhere else, but what it achieves? That is the key thing, and that is what we should consider.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Clare Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman. It is not where organisations are based but what they do that is important, but the Government of our country has to be based in our country and the instrument of the policy of our Government has to be based in our country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Streeter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is not the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Clare Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, this is a public-private partnership. As the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome said, it has in perpetuity a major Government stake, unless new legislation is introduced. It is operated by a set of arrangements that the private sector would never bring into being, and which are designed specifically to promote development. It is an instrument of the policy of our country and Government. It is right that such an instrument should be based in our country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Worthington <span class='memberconstituency'>(Clydebank and Milngavie)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that it was the policy of the Government and the Opposition to support the World Trade Organisation in its attempts to remove the advantages of going offshore. Does my right hon. Friend agree with that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Clare Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do agree with my hon. Friend. It is important for international trade and international investment that, wherever possible, investment is treated equally and there are not distorting arrangements such as tax havens, where one often finds suspect practices. I thought that the poor little CDC should not bear the burden of the whole reform, but be treated as advantageously as any other investment company. Then, over time, reform will
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 98</span>
take place to deal with tax advantages and the disreputable practices on some of the islands and in other countries that offer such advantages,</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Savidge <span class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my right hon. Friend think that the Conservative party has perhaps been confused by the fact that it is now run from offshore?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Clare Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Streeter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We can all have some fun, but Conservative Members are trying to do what is best for the CDC. Can the Secretary of State get her rhetoric in line with what the Bill actually does? Private investors—many of whom may be overseas—are going to own 75 per cent. of the company. Its employees, as we have learnt today, will not be public employees. The Government will have a minority representation on the board. We are not talking about the Government of Britain going overseas, but about a company in which the Government will have a 25 per cent. shareholding and two employees. The remainder will be private sector, based in the most tax-efficient way in the most tax-efficient place.<br><br>
What is wrong with that? The Secretary of State has still not made her case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Clare Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am beginning to feel sorry for the hon. Gentleman. Although he is obviously intelligent, he has clearly not understood any of the Committee's proceedings or any of the Bill's purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Streeter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Lady answer my question?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Clare Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am answering, but the hon. Gentleman obviously cannot hear me. It is impossible for these rational and clear concepts to penetrate his brain. Beyond the answer that I have given, I cannot help him. If everyone but him is persuaded by it, I am sorry. I could try again later, more slowly and at greater length, if that would help. I have given the answer, and if he does not understand it, that is his problem.<br><br>
I turn to the question of sub-Saharan Africa. During the Committee's first sitting, when I spoke briefly before I had to leave, I described the process that we went through in the Department when I was given the advice that we would have to go offshore to get a level playing field for tax purposes if we decided to proceed with the partnership. I was always strongly attracted by the proposals for the partnership because it would increase private sector investment in developing countries and prove that the private sector can get a fair rate of return. The CDC would then deliver more investment, and other private sector investment would follow because the CDC would have demonstrated that a reasonable rate of return can be achieved in poor countries. That was the objective, and I believed that it was highly desirable and that we needed a partnership to do it.<br><br>
When I was told that in order to be able to raise private sector finance we would have to go offshore, I said that that was a terrible stumbling block, because we could not have a major instrument of British development policy going offshore. I suggested that to be based in sub-Saharan Africa would be acceptable,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0249">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 99</span>
because that would be symbolic of bringing investment to needy countries. The answer I was given is that no-one would invest if it went to sub-Saharan Africa. Investment in such countries is low, and would be seen as politically risky because the Governments concerned might change the law. Therefore, desirable as it might be in principle, and acceptable as it might be in symbolic development terms, it would not work for market purposes.<br><br>
The hon. Member for South-West Devon said that the offices of the CDC were lavish and excessive. I have been there twice, and have had lunch there. It seemed clean and smart, but not excessive—exactly as it should be. I said that any changes that we had to make in arrangements would require new skills because equity investment required people with new skills for the new CDC. Clearly, we should pay the rates that are needed to get people of the right quality. However, the CDC remains a public-private partnership and a development instrument and needs to attract people with a public commitment to successful development. We should not, therefore, seek to imitate the City's lavishness and excessive salaries.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman might feel more offended than I do, but what he says is not true. If he has been to the CDC offices, he will have seen that they are not lavish and excessive, but attractive and fairly plain—they are for working people. It would be wrong not to correct the impression that the hon. Gentleman gave.<br><br>
I come now to the remarks made by the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford, who is the Chairman of the Select Committee on International Development. He thinks that the CDC should have always been tax exempt, and I understand his argument. We are talking about public sector money for development, so what is the point of the CDC paying tax and then being given money out of the public purse again? I sympathise with that point, but we are moving beyond it.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also said that we all agreed about the objective of increasing private sector investment in the poorest countries.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman then asked about the provisions that we made last year for possible losses as a result of the Asian crisis, particularly in Pakistan and so on. He asked what would happen if those losses were made good and there was a big increase in profits in later years. He asked how those profits would be treated for tax purposes. The answer would depend on when they fell. If they fell before the exemption came into effect, they would be taxed; if they fell after, they would not. It is as simple as that.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman then asked whether stamp duty would be paid in the country in which the investment was made if the CDC were privatised and went offshore. The answer would depend on the local tax regime. He said that many countries did not tax CDC investments because they were seen as a welcome development support. If the CDC were completely privatised, however, I assume that those attitudes
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 100</span>
would begin to change across the world. The CDC would start to behave like a normal investment company. The countries involved would take the decision, but I assume that they would start to treat the CDC like any other investment company and that it would be subject to the same tax regime.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wells</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is another obstacle that any company that invests in the CDC to privatise it will have to overcome. Such a company would have to bear the additional taxation involved in forming the CDC into an offshore company in the private sector.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Clare Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes his point well. The tax exemption is not a ruse to prevent the CDC from being privatised; we need it for there to be a level playing field and for the CDC to be an effective development instrument. That means that those who are thinking of privatising it must also think about losing the tax exemption and going through all the complicated procedures involved in transferring ownership of its assets around the world, with all the time, palaver and legal change that that would involve. That is a considerable burden. Those involved would then be likely to face different tax treatment in many of the countries that give privileged tax treatment to CDC investments, which are so welcome because the CDC is a development, not a profit-seeking instrument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to what the Secretary of State has said. What is there to prevent countries from changing the tax status of the CDC when they see that 75 per cent. of the ownership is not with the Government? Is there anything to protect the CDC in that instance?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Clare Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, the tax treatment in the countries concerned is a matter for those countries. As the hon. Lady will know, as well as managing their own public finances better and investing in basic health care and basic education for their people, those of the poorest countries that are reformers desperately want to attract inward investment to speed up economic growth and reduce poverty. The motivation to attract investment through the CDC is high and the interest in the possibility of its producing more investment is high. All Governments are sovereign, and they will all make their own decisions about how to treat companies for taxation, including the CDC.<br><br>
6.15 pm<br><br>
I wish to make clear to the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford, although he did not ask this exact question, that the CDC will not be exempt from United Kingdom stamp duty during the tax exemption period—stamp duty is not included in the provision for which the company is exempt I wished to draw that to the hon. Gentleman's attention—I thought that he might have been assuming that that was the case. Although he moved on towards the end of his remarks, I have now dealt with the hon. Gentleman's points.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wells</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One doubt lingers in my mind about the Secretary of State's answer. Stamp duty will be payable during the period in which the CDC is formed into a company limited by shares, albeit one owned in part at least by the Government. Who will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0250">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 101</span>
pay that stamp duty—the Department for International Development or the CDC?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Clare Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The CDC will pay, and that must be so. In an entanglement of funding, a complicated argument could be made about who pays ultimately. Obviously the organisation must pay its own stamp duty.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) agreed that we were considering an instrument of government development policy, and that it should appropriately be located in this country. He asked several important questions, the first of which concerned whether the tax arrangements constituted a state aid that would contravene EC competition law and require permission to be asked of the Commission.<br><br>
We have already consulted informally with the Commission. The advice that has been given to us, the Commission's view and our view is that the arrangements will not constitute a state aid. As I said on Second Reading, because the question could loom over the CDC before we go to market, we think that we should go to the Commission and get an open statement that the arrangements do not represent a state aid. Anyone thinking of investing in the company could thus have that judgment clearly on the record. That is how we intend to proceed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Heath</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Secretary of State for that assurance. Is she saying that she will seek EU clarification immediately prior to flotation or sale, or that she will do it once the Bill has reached the statute book so that there is no doubt during the interim trading period?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Clare Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am saying the latter—we have already consulted about what we intend to do, but that is not the same as having done it. Once the legislation is passed, we shall immediately consult and get the Commission to make a clear statement so that, before the company goes to market, the Commission's position will be absolutely clear to anyone considering investing in the CDC.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome then asked an interesting question about whether the loss of tax through the company's exemption had been quantified. The answer is no—that has not been quantified because there was never such an option. To have tried to create a public-private partnership for the CDC, and to keep it onshore without any tax arrangements, would have been completely unviable. It was not an option, and so there was never such a costing—the choice was between offshore or special arrangements. It would have never succeeded, so the question is about a loss of funding that never would have arisen.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman then asked about activities, and about the tax treatment of subsidiary companies of the CDC. The company currently has investment funds outside the United Kingdom. It raises funds in Latin America to invest in Latin America, as it does in other places. Those funds never come through the United Kingdom. Such arrangements are already in place. In the future, CDC might well invest in companies that manage funds for others.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 102</span>
The answer is very clear: the tax-exempt status is linked to the golden share and all the powers and duties that that imposes. It belongs only to that company. A separate company that is structured differently will not receive the tax exemption, wherever it is located, even if its headquarters are in the United Kingdom. The tax exemption goes with the golden share and everything entrenched in that, which is the public part of the partnership. If the golden share is ever sold or got rid of, the tax exemption goes as well. Only the company that is controlled by the golden share, under those rulings, is entitled to the tax exemption. If CDC has other companies that it partly or wholly owns, they do not receive the tax exemption. They are separate companies, and are taxed in the normal way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heath</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that point. I am curious to know the position of profits derived from those subsidiary companies that accrue to the corporation, with its tax exempt status, and how they are treated for tax purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Clare Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am using logic: I think that the principle is clear. I understand the hon. Gentleman's question: if CDC wholly owns a separate company that makes a high profit, some of which goes to CDC, how will that profit be treated for tax purposes as it processes through CDC? The answer must be that when the profit is made by the subsidiary company, it is subject to the normal tax law of wherever the company's headquarters are located. Once the funding becomes part of CDC's funding, it is, for any future purpose—because it would become part of the proceeds of CDC—tax-exempt in the way that all CDC's funds and investments will be tax-exempt. But at the point when the profit was made and passed over, it would be liable to whatever tax was in place, such as full British tax, although it is likely that many of these companies will not have their headquarters in Britain. Some of them may be offshore, which might make the hon. Member for South-West Devon rather happy.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome mentioned the seven-year tax arrangements. I have attempted to answer that point already. The seven-year period is necessary because it will take a long time to implement the legal changes necessary to take the company offshore, and also to provide a fair assurance to anyone thinking of making a major investment through CDC that if they did so when it was tax exempt, that would be the likely life of an investment. They would know that it would be treated in that way, and if there was to be any change, it would be made under the new arrangements with a different tax treatment.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked whether there was any room for tax abuse in the interim. If a future Government were foolish enough to privatise CDC and started the process, the hon. Gentleman wants to know whether the seven-year period would allow any opportunity for tax abuse. Not being tax expert, I can only say that I am sure that the Inland Revenue would not allow that to happen. I am advised that once the decision has been made to sell the golden share and arrangements are under way, the exemption falls for any new arrangements. It is not a United Kingdom tax
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V005P0I0251">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 103</span>
haven at that point. The provision allows CDC to go offshore by moving its management and control offshore before the exemption expires. [<i>Interruption.</i>] No, I do not think that that answers the hon. Gentleman's question. I understand his point that before the exemption expires, in the seven-year period, some vultures looking for a quick return could come in and use the tax exemption for their advantage. I do not know the answer, but we can be sure that the Inland Revenue has thought about it. It is, quite rightly, absolutely determined not to create any opportunities for tax abuse. Again, I will take advice from the Inland Revenue on that point and get back to the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford asked a further question about stamp duty. He assumed that shares in the new CDC will be exempt from stamp duty, but the new provisions do not make such an exemption.<br><br>
After all the waiting, the tax arrangements are a damp squib. They simply implement what we said we would implement. I respect the irritation in the other place and elsewhere that the tax arrangements were not tabled sooner, but they have been tabled now, and they achieve the objective that we set. Most members of the Committee believe that it is right that we make proper tax arrangements for the PPP so that its headquarters can be located in our country, because it is an instrument of our development policy. There may be one individual who is not persuaded by the argument, but all eccentrics are welcome in our country. As John Stuart Mill once said, that is a sign of a free country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Streeter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am tempted to open with the comment that it takes one to know one, but I shall not. I am not persuaded by the Secretary of State's argument. We want CDC to succeed. We want it to compete with offshore funds. We think that there are simpler ways to achieve that, and that she has turned her back on the most obvious route, which is to allow CDC to go offshore. I do not think that the country would crumble and come to an end or that the royal family or Government would fall as a result of CDC going offshore. I speak as a proud supporter of the royal family, unlike some people in the Room.<br><br>
The Secretary of State has already made it clear that either CDC goes offshore now or it will be extremely difficult for it to do so in years to come. I do not think that the Government have thought the matter through fully. It is a question not of being spivvy or sleazy, but of doing what is right for the British taxpayer and for those people whose lives we hope to improve by allowing the CDC to expand, spread its wings and do a terrific job in the 21st century.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony McWalter <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hemel Hempstead)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was unable to attend the end of the tax briefing yesterday. It might have helped him if he had been. One of the questions raised concerned what would happen if the regulations governing offshore activities on a world level changed significantly. Even if that happened—if all the tax havens were brought back into standard European tax regimen or
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 104</span>
something else—the Bill's arrangements would be insulated from such changes. That makes them more fire proof than the hon. Gentleman suggested.</span></p>
<p>[MR. DENNIS TURNER <i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Streeter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know of any suggestions that offshore tax havens are under threat over the next few years. However, I am aware that the European Commission could consider carefully this country's arrangements in terms of setting up such a company and all the possible implications of that.<br><br>
We will take further advice because the tax proposals are still new to us. We will not divide the Committee at this stage. We want CDC to succeed well in the 21st century, so we shall raise the matter in the future.</span></p>

I want to ask the Secretary of State a question or two about the liquidation of the company. We all hope that the company will succeed and that liquidation will not happen in our lifetimes, but although we hope for the best we must provide for the worst. She said at our first sitting that the risks would be shared between the private sector and the Government. However, in the event of the company going into liquidation, is it her understanding that the Government would in any way seek to bail out any of the private investors who lose money? I understand that that would not be the case, but I would like her to clarify whether all investors take their own risks, pro rata, in the event of liquidation.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Clare Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

That is the answer to his question, and I think that it is the one that he wanted.</span></p>

INVESTMENT POLICY OF THE CORPORATION</div> <!-- title -->
<p>'.—(1) The Corporation shall at the end of each complete financial year after the day appointed under section 3(3) make a report to the Secretary of State on its investments during that twelve month period and on its policy on future investments.</p>
<p>(2) The Secretary of State shall as soon as practicable lay a report under subsection (1) before Parliament.'.—[<i>Mr. Gary Streeter.</i>]</p>
<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Streeter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br><br>
This new clause is more problematic and much more important. It is the heart of the matter. We want the CDC to succeed and to retain its important focus on developmental objectives. The new clause is designed to be yet another check on decisions that the CDC makes on its development objectives over the next few years.<br><br>
We all want the CDC to succeed and to continue what it does now excellently. The Secretary of State is confident that she has enshrined its developmental objectives in a belt-and-braces way, and I hope that she is right. I do not want to be a boring old lawyer, but I want to test that by asking a question. A future board of the CDC—not the current directors, or the current Secretary of State, who would not permit what I am about to suggest might happen, but we must legislate on the basis that the people involved will change—might decide, because of shareholder pressure, to invest in only the three top listed companies in only three of the countries specified in the first schedule to the investment policy—such as Kenya, India and Zimbabwe. Viable companies exist in those countries, which in many ways are not as poor as others. Would the current framework prevent it from doing so?<br><br>
I am not referring to the likelihood of a new board doing that. That is not the test. The test is whether it will be legally possible for a future board of directors to make such a decision. They may be under shareholder pressure because returns have been poor; the shareholders themselves may be under pressure and need more. Would the current framework prevent such a decision from being made?<br><br>
My test is just one possibility: there may be many others. I cannot find anything in the memorandum and articles of association, the business principles, the investment strategy or the memorandum of understanding that would prevent a future board of directors from making such decisions. They may be bizarre, but if the directors are under enormous pressure to achieve a rapid rate of return for their shareholders, that is not impossible.<br><br>
The amendment is designed to bring back CDC's investment policy and decisions to the House of Commons once a year so that we may look over the Secretary of State's shoulder five or 10 years down the road. It constitutes another pressure on shareholders and directors in future: they will know that the House of Commons will consider decisions, and may debate them.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 106</span>
The amendment would provide other belt or pair of braces—another safety check to ensure that the important and vital developmental objectives are enshrined. I hope that the Secretary of State will not lavish her usual praise on me but will take the amendment seriously, as it is meant. We shall want to return to it at greater length on Report. It is a pity that we are running out of time to discuss this important matter, but I shall leave it there. The question has been put, and I hope that she will respond to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wells</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wanted to make a point about the new clause, which is rather important, especially in the light of our debate. In the report of the Select Committee on International Development, we raised the question of CDC's accountability to Parliament and to the International Development Committee. In paragraph 43, we said that although the Government will hold shares in CDC for the foreseeable future, CDC should report on how its directors have used their voting power, on what changes and returns CDC has made and on what dividends the Department for International Development has received on its shares. As loans from the Treasury and the Department for International Development seem to be envisaged in the first stage of the CDC's new form, and probably in the second, judging from the estimates, it is essential to provide a mechanism and a requirement for CDC to report annually to the House of Commons, as it does now. That is an important consideration. If the Secretary of State feels that she cannot accede to it now, perhaps she will think about it and come back on Report.<br><br>
The right hon. Lady told the Select Committee that she sought to set up an institution that would entrench the public sector and development interests and allow the institution to run itself without intervention unless it departed from those interests. However, it has become clear that until it sells sufficient shares to the private sector to enable it to borrow on the private market, it will be entirely dependent for expansion on investments made by the Secretary of State and the Treasury through the loans board or in the form of further equity.<br><br>
The CDC is, and will remain, very much the creature of the Government, even if only 26 per cent. or 30 per cent. is owned by the Government. A lot of things will change at that point. It is important that Parliament should know the Secretary of State's policy on the CDC from time to time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Clare Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We agree strongly with the hon. Members for South-West Devon and for Hertford and Stortford that there must be full reporting to Parliament. However, the amendment is probably unnecessary. Article 51 of CDC's articles of association require it to report annually on its compliance with its investment policy. The Government will report annually to Parliament on their accountability for the work of the Department. The Department is also accountable to the Select Committee, which has the power to require us to appear before it at any time if it has any worries about how the Government's ownership of and role within the CDC was or was not being exercised. CDC will

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 107</span>
also be under the reporting obligations of a plc under the Companies Act. I accept all that has been said about the need to account fully to Parliament, but we believe that the arrangements that are already in place will achieve that end.<br><br>
The hon. Member for South-West Devon challenged us on whether the requirements of the CDC's ethical policy, and the entrenchment of 50 per cent. and 70 per cent. of investment in poor countries, will be met by free investments—he suggested safe countries such as Kenya, India and Zimbabwe. If all the rules and the entrenched provisions could be met by that requirement, it would be technically possible, and the passing of the amendment would not stop it. It would merely have to be reported on. But the situation in Kenya and Zimbabwe is extremely worrying. It would be a pretty badly organised investment organisation that loaded all of its investments into companies in those two countries, whose economies are in a worrying condition.<br><br>
My fundamental point is that the purpose of the amendment, which we fully applaud, is met by the arrangements that are in hand. It is therefore not necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Streeter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I mentioned Kenya and Zimbabwe not necessarily to discuss the current circumstances in those countries but to make the point that some top-notch, high-flying, high-performing companies already operate in some of those countries. It would be possible, in my opinion, for the CDC to invest in them and still meet its objectives under the documentation that we are discussing today, but it would run counter to all that members of the Committee believe that we are setting up. We want the CDC to continue to invest in the poorest of the poor in the developing world. Kenya and Zimbabwe may not be good examples, but the CDC could invest in top-notch companies in many other countries, such as China. I am not sure that the enshrinement of developmental objectives—the framework put in place by the Secretary of State—works in that sort of scenario.<br><br>
I accept the reply that she gave and that she will not change her mind now. We shall return to the matter on Report, not in an attempt to undermine the Secretary of State, but because we want to improve the safeguards built into the company. Although a future board would be quirky if it made such decisions, it should not be able to take them and blow the 50 years of investment that British taxpayers have made and kick in the face the people who need our help. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</span></p>

<p><i>Brought up, read the First and Second time, and added to the Bill.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the Chairman do report the Bill, as amended, to the House.</p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 110</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Streeter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On behalf of Her Majesty's loyal Opposition, who produced a crack team for this Committee, I thank you, Mr. Maxton, for presiding over this Committee. I pay tribute to your chairmanship, to that of your colleague, Mr. Gale, and to the <i>Hansard</i> reporters and all the House of Commons staff and officials who have made this such an enjoyable Committee to be part of. We have worked hard, but have made progress and got to the heart of the matter. I thank everyone for their efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition got in before me, because the Secretary of State and I were fighting over who should make the vote of thanks—I lost.<br><br>
On behalf of the Secretary of State and my colleagues, I thank you, Mr. Maxton, and your co-Chairman, Mr. Gale. I also thank the Clerks.<br><br>
At one point during the middle of a speech, I turned round to see that the Clerk had grown a beard, or so I thought. However, it transpired that a different Clerk had arrived.<br><br>
I thank the <i>Hansard</i> reporters, who do a remarkable job making sense of what we say, the officials and our advisers, including those from the Inland Revenue. I thank my colleagues and, last but not least, those on the Opposition Benches—the Conservatives and particularly the Liberal Democrats. In a manifestation of great generosity, I say that if I bump into members of the Committee or officials later tonight, I shall be happy to buy them half a pint or a small sherry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank both hon. Members for their kind remarks about me and Mr. Gale. I will not respond to the hon. Gentleman's kind offer. However, I am having dinner with him, so he can buy that instead.<br><br>
I am sure that all the officials, <i>Hansard</i> and the other officers in the Room will have heard the remarks about them and will pass on the thanks to their colleagues who were present at other sittings of the Committee.</span></p>
