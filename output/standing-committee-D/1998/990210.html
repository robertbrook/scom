	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Chope 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Christchurch)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><q><p>That the Committee has considered the Hallmarking (Hallmarking Act Amendment) Regulations 1998 (S.I., 1998, No. 2978).</p></q>
It is a pleasure to move the motion under your chairmanship, Mr. Cunningham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition prayed against the regulations so that we could have a proper discussion about them. There is much confusion about the Government's policy on hallmarking. Are the Government introducing the regulations because they have to or because they want to? Michael Winwood, the secretary of the British Hallmarking Council said:
	<br><q><p>"We have had to accept the situation. We had no choice."</p></q>
I hope that we will find out from the Minister how the regulations interact with the European Union's proposed directive on precious metals. Do the Government support the directive, which would force all EU countries to use the same hallmarking system and require all silver and precious goods to have the E symbol on them?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The starting point for our debate is that article 30 of the European Union treaty promotes the free movement of goods. Who would have presumed that that article would, 20 or 30 years later, be interpreted in such a way as to outlaw the ancient and revered practice of hallmarking in this country? Hallmarking is one of the original ways in which we ensured consumer protection. We have had a British lion silver hallmark uninterrupted since 1544—for more than 450 years. Is that simply to be abolished and replaced by symbols that nobody understands and which have no tradition, relevance or meaning for the British consumer? Is this yet another example of the erosion of our sovereignty, which Europe continues to salami-slice away?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations make the situation much more complicated for the ordinary consumer, who is familiar with the concept of sterling silver. It now appears that we will have many varieties of silver. We will not quite know what they are unless we look at the detailed number on them. Many varieties will come from other countries in the European Economic Area. Some will be manufactured to different levels of fineness from the old sterling silver. Will that benefit the consumer or will it lead to consumer concern and confusion?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consumer protection is at the heart of the issue. It is an offence for any trader to sell or describe an article in gold, silver or platinum unless it is hallmarked. Hallmarking provides the customer with a guarantee of the fineness of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
the precious metal content. The most recent changes to hallmarking system, which incorporated platinum into it, were introduced by the Labour Government in 1975.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our concern is that the present system of clarity is being replaced by one of confusion. It will no longer necessarily be possible for consumers to know the date on which a precious item was manufactured. They will find that items that are not manufactured in this country can carry the lion hallmark, but they will know that it is purely a decorative symbol. There is much concern that if the next directive, which is currently being discussed, comes into effect, it will prevent the use of the lion on English silver altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So we would like the Government to answer quite a few questions this afternoon. In particular, we would like them to confirm that they still believe that manufacturers' self-certification, as practised in some continental countries, offers a lower form of guarantee to consumers than does the independent marking of precious metal articles, as practised by the UK assay offices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is causing people outside much concern. What proposals has the Department to enlighten the British consumer about the contents of the regulations, which have already been passed into law, notwithstanding our prayer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Teddy Taylor 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rochford and Southend, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While accepting that there is a terrible shambles, I hope that my hon. Friend is not saying that it is the Government's fault—or is he?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend asks me to ascribe responsibility and blame; I shall not do so. My hon. Friend knows more about this matter than any member of the Committee. What appears to have happened is that when we signed up to the European Union single market, we had not realised all of its implications. We have had to comply with rulings of the European Court of Justice, especially in the Dutch case that lies behind the regulations, which appear inconsistent with the original basis on which we entered the single market and accepted its system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend that we should not place all the responsibility on the broad shoulders of the Minister, and that responsibility goes wider—in particular with respect to the way in which European jurisprudence enables the European court of Justice to interpret European treaties in a way that no one intended when we signed them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.37 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Competition and Consumer Affairs (Dr. Kim Howells)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope) in saying how good it is to serve on a Committee under your chairmanship, Mr. Cunningham. This is the first time that it has happened to me—and, I am sure, to many other members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Christchurch focused on the most crucial issue: whether we will be able to help consumers to understand what they are purchasing and to make the right decisions. That ought to underpin any consumer strategy of any Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0039">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
If I may, I shall give an account of what we have done through the Hallmarking (Hallmarking Act Amendment) Regulations 1998, and what we have not done, to remove any confusion that may have arisen in the minds of members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations, which amend the Hallmarking Act 1973, were made for three reasons. First and foremost they were made to align UK law with European Union rules on the free circulation of products in the single market. We have ensured that UK legislation reflects the existing position in Community law. That is therefore a matter of clarity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the regulations are intended to ensure that United Kingdom manufacturers are not disadvantaged by the new freedom to trade in articles of precious metal in Europe on the basis of national hallmarks—indeed, to ensure that they can take full advantage of it. That is important: it is a question not just of the validity of imported precious metal but of our ability to export.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, given the need to amend the Hallmarking Act 1973 in line with European rules, we have also taken the opportunity to update the Act to take account of long-standing concerns of the British Hallmarking Council and of a part of the trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should stress at the outset that there is no question of reducing the high level of protection that hallmarking and the Hallmarking Act 1973 afford to consumers in the United Kingdom. The hon. Member for Christchurch was right in that respect—we must be very careful. Some of the amendments made by the regulations will, however, increase consumer choice and make hallmarks more readily understandable to consumers. I hope that both those factors will strengthen the value of hallmarking in the future. Greater freedom of movement of hallmarked articles of precious metal will be of benefit to UK exporters, given that UK hallmarks will be accepted throughout the EEA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall briefly list the changes that the regulations have made to the Act. The definition of "approved hallmarks" in section 2 of the Act has been amended to allow for the recognition of specific hallmarks from other EEA states. that follows the 1994 Houtwipper judgment at the European Court of Justice and earlier case law, which made clear that our hallmarking legislation, like that of other hallmarking states, was in breach of article 30 of the EC treaty. We will, however, recognise only hallmarks that have been struck under the law of another member state by an independent body, and which provide information equivalent to that provided by our own hallmarks and which is intelligible to consumers in the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Teddy Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose—</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I shall give way; I was looking in the hon. Gentleman's direction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Teddy Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that the legislation will make a total and complete shambles that will leave consumers unprotected? While he is rightly trying to preserve the advantages of the hallmarking system—for which I praise him—consumers will see
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
goods coming from at least 10 other European states where self-certification is permitted. How the blazes will the consumer judge one or the other? Will we have notices? Will not unscrupulous people who sell things be able to take consumers for a ride? Will not the protection that we have had for years simply fade away because of the new competition, for which I certainly do not blame the Minister?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the hon. Gentleman's anxiety has a great deal of validity, and I am glad that he expressed it. I just said that no item imported into Britain without a valid mark made by an independent and mutually recognised marking organisation such as the British Hallmarking Council will be allowed to be sold. Self marking done by firms themselves will not be allowed. The matter is not to be confused with the regulations' remit, although it is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Currently, an EC directive is being considered that would do away with the need for hallmarking. I understand that it is the subject of a stalemate, which is not surprising. Under the directive, we would be confronted with imported goods that might or might not have hallmarks, but it would not matter, because they would have to be sold, accepted and so on. That is a real danger, but it dos not concern the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Owen Paterson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Shropshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How does the Minister square his remarks about the validity of foreign assaying with comments from a major jewellery business in my constituency? I have a letter which states:
	<br><q><p>"We have imported jewellery from European countries from time to time, and the metals on occasions are below the correct carat. Sometimes we receive 9 carat when the goods are said to be 18 carat, and occasionally the carat level is narrowly missed."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously I do not know about that particular case. Britain has trading standards officers who regularly test for and find fraudulent goods on sale. Such goods are as likely to be manufactured in this country as in Italy, Germany or anywhere else. There is a danger of fraud, and if we do not get hallmarking under control and ensure mutual recognition of the standards being introduced, we will be in big trouble. That is why the Government have brought the regulations before the House—to ensure a degree of clarity that does not currently exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall explain about the new measurements of fineness of imported material and material that is made in this country. Part I of schedule 2 has been amended to abolish the distinct hallmarks which were, until the end of last year, struck on imported articles. The same marks can now be struck both on imports and on UK-manufactured articles. In other words, goods that are imported into this country can be hallmarked by British hallmarkers. Reputable firms—on the continent, at least—are increasingly seeking information about how that is done, so that they can enjoy the same advantages of recognition in this country as they do on the continent. The distinction between imports and UK articles that are hallmarked at UK assay offices was also considered to be in breach of article 30 of the treaty, because it discriminated against articles of precious metal that were manufactured elsewhere in the EEA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0040">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
The same part of the schedule has also been amended to increase the range of finenesses to which UK assay offices can hallmark—the point that was made by the hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson). That is intended to ensure that UK manufacturers can produce articles of precious metal to the same principal standards of fineness as their competitors in Europe. It limits the likelihood of standards of fineness appearing on the UK market with which UK manufacturers would be unable to compete. We have not, however, extended the range of finenesses to include all those which exist in Europe, but the principal standards only. That is because it is generally agreed that it is not in the interests of consumers to encourage—as the hon. Member for Rochford and Southend, East (Sir T. Taylor) put it—a proliferation of standards that would make it difficult to compare value for money and could lead to confusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new standards of fineness which have been added are those that appear in the agreed international standard, together with additional "pure" standards which have been agreed by all member states in the context of negotiations on a proposed directive on the marking of precious metals. The schedule has been further amended to require that all UK hallmarks should include a millesimal indication of the standard of fineness. I hope that all members of the Committee have before them a copy of the explanatory leaflet. We are going to ensure that those leaflets are placed in retailers' shops so that people can see for themselves exactly what the emblems and figures mean.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the increased range of finenesses which will appear on the market, it is more important than ever that consumers should be able to understand the information about fineness that is contained in hallmarks. However, the existing traditional fineness symbols—such as the lion for sterling silver and the crown for gold—will continue to appear, alongside the millesimal mark, as voluntary marks. In practice, the assay offices are continuing to strike traditional marks unless a manufacturer specifically requires them not to do so. Information from the London assay office has indicated that the vast majority of its clients continue to want traditional pictorial marks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 4 of the 1973 Act has been amended to remove the requirement that hallmarks should include a letter indicating the year in which the article was hallmarked. To be candid with the Committee, that is the part of the legislation about which I feel most uneasy. I have been told that it is a device that is mainly used by experts—we see it on the "Antiques Roadshow". It is another consequence of European case law, which prevents member states from requiring an article of precious metal to be re-hallmarked merely because it does not bear an indication of the date of hallmarking. Because the requirement cannot be made of imported articles that were hallmarked elsewhere in the EEA, it would be unfair to make such a requirement with regard to articles that are hallmarked here—although, in practice, most UK manufacturers are likely to continue to ask for the date letter to be struck on a voluntary basis, as is allowed by the amended Act. The leaflet indicates the letter for this year, which is, I think, Z.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
The process of formulating the regulations has been long and difficult. It required widespread consultation and liaison with the European Commission, which is never easy; it also meant a good deal of liaison and consultation with British retailers and manufacturers. The result is a careful balance between the requirements of European law and the needs of consumers and the industry. I think that we have got the balance right by maintaining a high level of consumer protection and ensuring that manufacturers and consumers in the United Kingdom can benefit from the new freedom of movement of articles of precious metal, while at the same time meeting our European obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basic principles of hallmarking have not changed. Recognised hallmarks, whether or not they have been struck in the United Kingdom, will continue to consist of an indication of the registered sponsor—that is the manufacturer or importer of the article—the assay office where the article has been tested and hallmarked, and the fineness of the precious metal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps it would be useful if I end my speech at this point and listen to what Committee members have to say. I shall try to answer any specific questions later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.51 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian Cotter 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Weston-super-Mare)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join the hon. Member for Christchurch in saying that I do not want to apportion blame to this Government or to the previous one. We have found ourselves in a difficult situation. I hope, however, that we can engage in a constructive discussion and search out the points that need to be dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Association of Goldsmiths and the British Jewellers' Association both have concerns about the Government's proposed amendment, although I accept that the Government are putting it forward in good faith, to try to correct the situation. However, a European directive is on the chocks, so I hope that the Minister and the Committee will examine the matter seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like it or not, there is trading within the Community, so we must ensure that it is carried out satisfactorily in terms of both the trade and product quality. Trading within the Community offers the opportunity for clear standards, competitive prices and a range of products for consumers in this country.

On behalf of the National Association of Goldsmiths and the British Jewellers' Association, I urge the Committee and the Minister to bear in mind the need to adapt to the situation in which we find ourselves today, despite the obvious respect for our own hallmarking traditions. I was speaking to a jeweller only this afternoon who very much likes the assay system. The fact remains, however, that the directive is imminent. I hope that the Minister is considering how we can work within it while making our views known. If we do not do that, we could find systems emerging with which we do not agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Change is on the way. Although we may not be entirely happy with the system operating in European mainland countries, a number of checks on quality and consistency have been made—a matter to which the hon. Member for North Shropshire referred—and no failures have come to my attention. I understand that the four assay organisations did that work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Raymond Whitney 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wycombe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise with some diffidence, because this is not an area in which I can claim any expertise.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Cotter), I wish to voice the concerns expressed in a letter from the National Association of Goldsmiths and the British Jewellers Association, which I presume has been circulated to all members of the Committee. The letter raises concerns that should be aired and, I hope, answered, during the course of our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two concerns in particular which I should like the Minister to set at rest in his reply. First, it is not known which European hallmarks will be valid here. The letter says:
	<br><q><p>"A great many, an unquantified number, of foreign marks will be valid, and this is confusing for the trade and hopeless for the consumer."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Teddy Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Raymond Whitney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend and I will differ later. 	<i>[Laughter.]</i> However, I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his support up to this point. According to this—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Rochford and Southend, East (Sir T. Taylor) must behave himself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Raymond Whitney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The letter continues:
	<br><q><p>"The British Hallmarking Council, which has the duty, has been unable to provide illustrations for the new marks".</p></q>
I hope that we can approach this bread-and-butter issue without bashing Europe or defending Brussels at all costs, and without this Government bashing the previous one. I hope that we can look sensibly and calmly at the position that has been reached and decide how best to move forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I start from a position of instinctive support and pride for the old system of assay and hallmarking. The criterion must surely be to protect the British consumer and the British producer, and to give them the best opportunities. We should ensure that if there are other opportunities overseas, they should be made available to British producers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Sheerman 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Huddersfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman and I would agree that it is a pity when a Committee such as this ends up wrangling over pro-and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
anti-European views rather than discussing the real concern. I think that this is happening because of the antipathy that the hon. Member for Rochford and Southend, East has to Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not have the briefing from which the hon. Member for Wycombe (Sir R. Whitney) has just quoted. I cannot see what is wrong with the regulations. They keep the old system, as far as I understand it. I know a bit about this, because my wife has dealt in antique jewellery for many years. The regulations also add provisions regarding what will come in from other countries. The regulations strengthen the position rather than do any damage. Could the hon. Gentleman articulate a little more clearly the concerns of the National Association of Goldsmiths and the British Jewellers Association?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Raymond Whitney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would be misleading the Committee if I suggested that I had become an instant expert. The concern is that the status of the marking of imports from other European Union countries would be questionable. Also, it is not know which hallmarks are valid. Perhaps the Minister can lay these concerns to rest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sheerman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From what I know about this, it seems that at present jewellers are concerned because buyers must be very careful about where they buy jewellery or silver. There are all sorts of unknown marks on the continent and other places, and they must be carefully approached if people want to be certain of the quality of their purchases. The regulations will improve the situation and do nothing to harm it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Teddy Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Raymond Whitney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East asks how, and that is a valid question. Clearly, British and other European Union consumers must be protected. I believe that the trading standards approach and system offers that protection. It has been put to me that that is adequate protection; I would welcome a ministerial view on whether the Government consider that to be the case, if it is set against the alleged confusion which the measure will cause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cotter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, am seeking clarification. Will the hon Gentleman accept that because of the proposed directive we want a standardised system? Without such a system, trading in Europe will be very difficult for our producers. It will also be difficult to identify products from the Community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Raymond Whitney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman. Most of us have an instinctive emotional attachment to the old hallmarking system because it has a quaint, attractive Britishness, but we have moved passed that point and now have other criteria on which we should base a sensible relationship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The allegation made by the association is that in Germany and Italy, for example, the producer or sponsor produces marking for which they are responsible and it has been a shot in the arm for silver and precious metal producers in those countries. If that is true, we have a duty to consider such a successful system, not only
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0042">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
because there is a proposed European directive but in the interests of British consumers, provided, of course, that they are protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the author of the letter has his own axe to grind, but he assures me that low-quality producers, cowboys of any sort, be they British, German, Italian or any other nationality, can be taken care of through the trading standards system. It is extremely rare for the bad boys to become involved because there is a mark on the products, which are therefore easy to trace. Also we should not ignore the good principle of caveat emptor— let the buyer beware.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Teddy Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What does my hon. Friend suggest that a trading standards officer should do if someone sells a product from Italy or Germany with its own mark in my hon. Friend's constituency? What the blazes does he think any trading standards officer could do about that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Raymond Whitney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the standards are clear, products either attain the degrees of fineness or they do not and, be they German, Italian or British products, they either pass the test or they do not. I do not understand the difficulty that worries my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.3 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Teddy Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that hon. Members will think about the appalling situation we are in, and about our inability to do anything useful about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Huddersfield, who is a European Union fanatic, says that we must not think of the measure as for or against Europe. I want him to think about whether it is for or against democracy and, more importantly, about a process by which all the things for which we had responsibility are, slowly but surely, being transferred to European control, without our being able to do anything about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What did we start with? In Britain, for many years, consumers had the protection of the assay office and hallmarking. That means that constituents of the hon. Member for Huddersfield and every other hon. Member could go into a jeweller's shop and feel safe and secure in the knowledge that they were buying something of high quality, because of the independent assay officers. I know that it annoyed many goldsmiths and jewellers because an item that may have cost only £1 had to be hallmarked. It may have been a nuisance and an inconvenience but consumers knew when they bought from a goldsmith that they were well protected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cotter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a small point, but would not the hon. Gentleman accept that having a small-cost item checked adds a great deal to its cost? Another system might be just as good, especially for low-cost items.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Teddy Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point. He says that missing something that costs only a pound might be costly and that that is a shame. Would it not be splendid if Parliament—as an elected body—had the power to decide that? However,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
the tragedy is that the hon. Gentleman's views do not matter a damn. The Government's views do not matter either, because they cannot do anything about such issues. The hon. Gentleman may believe the situation to be wrong, right, silly or unfortunate, but his views do not matter because we will not decide the matter at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been a Member of Parliament for a very long time, and I find it most upsetting to see hon. Members sometimes practically crying when they decide on matters in which their power has almost disappeared. I remember our great debate on the homosexual age of consent. Bishops said on the radio that such a matter was terribly important, and in the Chamber hon. Members were almost crying—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Teddy Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not go into the matter—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am on my feet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the hon. Gentleman is upset—we all get upset from time to time—but I urge him to come back to the point and conduct himself a little better. He should not quarrel with Committee members, but try to convince them of his argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Teddy Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is very good advice, Mr. Cunningham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Committee members should appreciate that we are debating matters over which we have no control and on which our views are irrelevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What has gone wrong in hallmarking and assay offices? Many hon. Members happily voted for the Single European Act, although I voted against it. Consequently, the European Court of Justice made the Houtwipper decision of 1994, but that has not affected our law. The Government still have the power to say that nothing can be sold here unless it is hallmarked. Sadly, there is an unfortunate situation in which European law is different from British law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Houtwipper decision means that, under European law, it is valid to sell something in this country, but selling that same item is invalid under British law. How on earth can we resolve such a problem? We might initiate a case at the European Court of Justice. We could tell the court that European law allows something that is not allowed under British law, and ask it to decide the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do the Government think that there is a case for spending money going to the European Court of Justice? They have considered doing so before. The hon. Member for Huddersfield is old enough to remember the Merchant Shipping Act 1988. When the Act was passed, we all waved our arms with joy. The European Court, however, said that the Act was dead or kaput.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only way to resolve the hallmarking problem is to go to the European Court of Justice. However, the Government are conscientious about looking after taxpayers' money, so they may take the view that that would be a pointless and costly exercise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ludicrously, things can be sold in Britain under European law, even though that contravenes British law.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0043">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
The unfortunate Government have to cope with a situation that has arisen partly as a result of the European Court's decision and partly as a result of the Single European Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How serious is the situation? Many continental countries, especially Germany and Italy, have a wonderful system of self-certification. The bloke who makes the stuff puts a mark on it. Under European law, it is possible that goods from at least 10 European Economic Area states may be sold in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What should the Government do? We have heard about the advice of that ridiculous organisation, the National Association of Goldsmiths and the British Jewellers Association. Following that advice is the easy way out. That organisation consists of a crowd of people trying to protect their own jobs. What it recommends costs a lot of money, so why not scrap it all and go for a European directive? Europe will set the standards and everyone will be happy. That is typical of what happens time and again. The Government say that we are in a Euro-mess, so we should pass the matter over to Europe. However, if we do that, we move away from the old system, which has afforded wonderful protection to the British consumer. Under that system, consumers know that they are buying something of quality, and that an independent office has said that it is good.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sheerman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making a meal of it. I have never been described as a Euro-fanatic; I have always regarded myself as a reasonably positive Euro-pragmatist. The European measure seems, for once, to help the consumer and to be sensible in a European trading situation. Most of our exports go to Europe. Hallmarking dates from the time of the medieval guilds. The guilds devised the system; it was not established by Government regulation. People understood that systems and it became known. How do the regulations that we are considering harm the consumer? The hon. Gentleman has not convinced me, even if he has convinced other members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Teddy Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman. He claims that we trade mostly with Europe. That is true of imports, but not of exports. Since we joined the European Union, our deficit in trade with Europe is £155,000 million. However, that is a separate issue. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be careful when he talks about the majority of our trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to consider a crucial matter, which is not the fault of the Government of the regulations. The effect of the decision of the European Court of Justice is that the universal sale of hallmarked goods will end. That is sad, Even if the hon. Member for Huddersfield claims that that is a good idea, his views do not matter a damn. The views of the Committee or the House do not matter because the decision is made elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had a good system, which benefited consumers like me. We could buy an item from a jeweller's shop and know that it was of high quality. That will come to an end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are doing their best. They could take the easy way out and go for the European directive, leaving the consumer to choose hallmarked goods or self-certified goods. I am sure that the hon. Member for Huddersfield appreciates the advantages to consumers in the Green Paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Raymond Whitney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, if the proposal in the directive was accepted, hallmarks of the assay offices could still exist. If our constituents want to buy hallmarked English silver, wicked continental Europeans will not prevent them from doing that. Why is my hon. Friend worried?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Teddy Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend knows, it will still be possible to buy hallmarked goods if that system is kept going—it may not be. However, there will be two differences. First, some hallmarked articles will be marked with a big E, while self-certified goods will be marked with an additional small e. Will my hon. Friend's constituents be aware of those differences? When they buy a ring or a watch, will they check whether those items are hallmarked or self-certified in German or Italy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Raymond Whitney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should not continue the double act for too long. If my hon. Friend buys silver, does he look for the hallmark? Does he get out his reference book to make sure that he is buying what he wants? Why cannot our constituents do that in future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Teddy Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose—</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not want to prevent or curtail debate. Hon. Members realise that others are waiting to have their say. There is no sense having a ding-dong here. I am sure that the hon. Members can sort it out somewhere else. Could I also ask hon. Members to listen respectfully to the speaker? They may disagree with him but he is entitled to a hearing. Could the hon. Gentleman also speed it up a little?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Teddy Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Cunningham. I will stop very soon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The big difference between the hon. Gentleman's constituents and mine, whether they are intelligent, as his obviously all are, or not, as some are not, is that they have the full knowledge when they go into a jeweller's that everything is assayed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cotter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Much selling and buying in jewellery depends not so much on consumers' knowledge but on their trust in the person they buy from. That is no different now from how it will be in the future. We all go along and get advice from people who build up their trade from giving good advice. Most consumers do not understand and depend on a good adviser. I could say more about that, but the main point is that we depend on advice. That will continue to be the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Teddy Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a good idea. Go to a nice shop and everything will be all right. I hope that that is the case. The fact is that we have had this system of assay and hallmarking, which is a guarantee whether one goes to a nice shop or a not nice shop. Sometimes people believe that all will be well, but in future, sadly, it will not. The Government have tried to hold on to a bit of what we have at present, but they will be well aware that in doing so they are creating a problem. Under European law they will not be able to stop goods coming in from quite a number of EEA countries.

I am sorry that I have spoken for so long, but I feel passionately that something good, which has helped to build a major industry in Britain of £3 billion employing many people and bringing great satisfaction to consumer, is being scrapped. The Government are trying their best to save what is there and the great tragedy is that irrespective of the words, smiles and ignorant remarks of members of the Committee, our views are totally irrelevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a question for the Minister. The penultimate paragraph of the fine brochure that he has circulated states:
	<br><q><p>"In line with European rules the UK now recognises marks from other European countries as long as they have been struck by an independent body and are subject to that country's legal controls."</p></q>
That is clear. However the letter from the National Association of Goldsmiths and the British Jewellers Association talks about "sponsor marking and self-certification", which does not seem to mean
	<br><q><p>"struck by an independent body".</p></q>
The letter also says:
	<br><q><p>"Sponsor marking is the sole means of consumer protection in such diverse countries as Germany and Italy (which has the world's biggest industry)".</p></q>
Does that mean that nothing from Germany and Italy is valid in this country? That is how I read the brochure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The letter goes on to make some interesting points. It sees the precious metals directive as the ultimate solution to the problem. Does the Minister see this measure as a half-way house towards adopting the directive at some stage? Mr. Eric Poyser, the director of NAG—the National Association of Goldsmiths—says that under the directive articles will be cheaper for consumers and that they will have greater choice. He is fairly rude about the four assay offices in this country whose
	<br><q><p>"main tactic is to try to scare the consumer that sponsor marking lowers consumer protection."</p></q>
He also claims that:
	<br><q><p>"Sponsor marking will give the UK industry the chance to compete internationally"</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
which perhaps answers some of the concerns of the hon. Member for Rochford and Southend, East that we are not exporting enough because of barriers to our competing internationally. It seems that sponsor marking will enable us to do that, and will afford us
	<br><q><p>"the break-through the motor industry received in 1896 when the Red Flag Act was repealed".</p></q>
I do not know if it will have quite such a dramatic effect on the market as that. However, I should be grateful if the Minister would resolve my confusion, arising from what the leaflet states and the points made by the National Association of Goldsmiths.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.20 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sheerman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make only a couple of points. I seem to have annoyed the hon. Member for Rochford and Southend, East when I intervened on his remarks. I did not mean to, because I respect his views. He is a great champion of his causes. I do not share his anti-European view, but he is an asset to any Committee or debate in which he takes part. I defend his right to hold the views he does. I think that he was upset because I was smiling, but that was because he is such a good performer. He always amuses me, and my smiling during his remarks was meant as no disrespect. He was giving a classic performance and I appreciated it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman accused me of being ignorant, but I know something about the subject, and I wanted to make a point by intervening. I had not intended to make a speech. The measure seems to be a common-sense one. Yes, it flows from the European Court of Justice and is intended to make matters easier for industry and consumers. If all the jewellery in this room were handed to any one of us, I suspect that hardly any of us would be able to tell the year, assay mark or anything else. In normal commerce it is necessary to go to a trusted person who can interpret them. We depend on goldsmiths and silversmiths, in this country's great tradition of knowledge based on marks going back to the great guilds of the middle ages. I know that my right hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Benn) knows a great deal about that history. If I thought that the measure that we are considering would abolish the traditional right to place those marks, and to impart the information in them to consumers across Europe, I would be angry. However, that is not happening. The measure still allows those marks to indicate date, origin and quality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why do not we just accept this sensible bit of European legislation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.22 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: North Shropshire is not known for its jewellery industry, but there is one shining exception—a young guy who was at school with me. He was a swot. He sailed through his A-levels and got a 2:1 in part 1 at Oxford. Then he began to dabble in trinket shops and entered the jewellery trade. He became bored with the law and left Oxford early. He now employs more than 100 people in purpose-built premises half a mile from my home. He is the classic entrepreneur, whom all parties would, I understand, now support, now that most Labour Members have turned their backs on state socialism. He

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
is just the sort of person whom we all want to support. He turned his back on a profession, made money and employs people in an area where many jobs have disappeared following the crisis in agriculture. He is vehemently opposed to the legislation that we are discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main point that he makes in correspondence with me is that the hallmark is an internationally recognised standard. It has worked for 600 years. It is recognised in Osaka, Arezzo and Santiago in Chile. It is the world standard and no one doubts it. The obvious question is why change it? The measure before us treats it as a system designed purely to protect the consumer from dishonest or incompetent manufacture. My constituent makes the case that it is more than that. A few tiny marks enable people to identify the name of the sponsor, who is usually the manufacturer or importer, from the sponsor's mark, the year or marking from the year letter—usually the same year in which the piece was manufactured and supplied— from the year letter, and whether the item is of British manufacture or imported.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The blind drive to harmonisation will set the industry backwards. That is the firm conviction of my constituent, who believes that no one will gain—not the consumer, the manufacturer or the retailer. His belief is:
	<br><q><p>"Consumers do not want to lose the information contained in hallmarks including the date letter."</p></q>
They like traditional symbols; they do not want them replaced with anonymous numbers. He continues:
	<br><q><p>"The loss of the date letter makes it hard for professional jewellers to identify products to their time of manufacture and supply. This will greatly facilitate the role of defending barristers in criminal cases as it will no longer be possible for the trade to be certain when items were supplied."</p></q>
He believes, furthermore, that proposals to introduce self-marking for manufacturers without audit would be disastrous. As I said when I intervened on the Minister, that will lead to errors and international under-carating. He also argues that it will be
	<br><q><p>"a doddle for manufacturers to work in the black economy, as there will be no authority able to confirm or deny the existence of goods."</p></q>
Assay offices, which have existed for 600 years,
	<br><q><p>"stand as a block to the informal or black economy in precious metals. Other European countries have an appalling record in this regard."</p></q>
Why should we help the crooks extend their market share?

The hon. Member for Huddersfield was right to say that hallmarking was established by ancient guilds. Hallmarks were recognised as an untouchable standard throughout the world. But the European proposals will enable manufacturers and traders to deceive their customers as to the origin of the merchandise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My constituent continues:
	<br><q><p>"Italians are importing their silverware into Birmingham, calling them Victoria Silverware, hallmarking them as British made. The assay offices are not enforcing the law rigorously, as they are merely waiting for this practice to be made the normal practice. To the man in the street this is wrong."</p></q>
Furthermore:
	<br><q><p>"The Germans and the Italians have no assay offices and they claim that it would be too expensive for them to set them up. If they did set up properly run assay offices, we could accept their merchandise ready marked from their countries. Why should we come down to their level?"</p></q>

I will end with a brief quote from a recent letter—sorry, two short quotes for the 	<i>Hansard</i> writers. Here is the first:
	<br><q><p>"If Italian manufacturers try to maintain that their goods are made in Birmingham by selecting the traditional pictorial symbols of the Birmingham assay office and then producing brochures with traditional British names, then how can the Trading Standards enforce a law which says that this is fundamentally illegal, and probably criminal when the activity apparently receives full government support?"</p></q>
That was precisely the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East.

It is an industry of which we are proud in the west midlands. Secondly, I hope that the clear message from the Committee is that if we want a guarantee on quality, we should buy British and look for the British hallmark. I hope that the Committee can agree on both those points. I should like my hon. Friend the Minister to confirm that hallmarks are compulsory and here to stay—some Opposition Members do not seem fully to have grasped this point—and I hope that we can make rapid progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope to answer questions quickly, as hon. Members would wish. The hon. Member for Weston-Super-Mare (Mr. Cotter) urged the Government and the Committee to look carefully at the directive which I described as being stuck somewhere in Brussels at the moment. I assure hon. Members that we are looking at it carefully. The last thing that the Government want is for consumers to be handicapped by incomplete or wrong information by comparison with what they now have.

I was much surprised to see Opposition Members holding a letter from the National Association of Goldsmiths and the British Jewellers' Association—NAG, as the hon. Member for Cheltenham called it. None of my hon. Friends in the Committee has received such a letter, which is a sad reflection on those bodies. If they are interested in having a proper debate, they should not try to turn it into a cheap political stunt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it is because they realise that had it not been for Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition the debate would not be taking place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could not possibly contradict that, of course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel strongly about the subject. The whole business of verification of goods and the protection of intellectual property rights, will be one key to the successful trading of economies in the future. I do not accept that the Government do not care about it; they care a great deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to the hon. Member for Wycombe, the detailed explanation of what these concepts mean in the United Kingdom, as well as precisely which marks should be acceptable at any time, are spelt out, I am told, in guidance produced by the British Hallmarking Council. I expect retailers to use the BHC guidance, rather than the wording of a legal instrument, as the first point of reference. In addition, the local authorities co-ordinating body on food and trading standards has produced guidance for training standards officers and a moral guide for business. I hope that I have gone some way towards reassuring the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Raymond Witney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that and for his earlier remarks. It is alleged—I say no more than that—that the British Hallmarking Council has been unable to provide illustrations of the new marks, which seems a fairly serious allegation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. As I have said, I believe that there are illustrations, but I shall check that, and if there are not, I shall write to the hon. Gentleman about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the hon. Member for Cheltenham that the United Kingdom is not recognising manufacturing marks of articles that have come from, for example, Germany, without hallmarks, or articles that have been hallmarked by manufacturers. They will have to be hallmarked in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for—it is certainly not from Westmorland—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: North Shropshire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Collins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Westmorland and Lonsdale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Westmorland is a very fine place. Come to see it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been there—I am a mountain climber. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I mean Westmorland, not north Shropshire, nice place though that is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
No doubt the hon. Member for North Shropshire did not intend to denigrate the work of assay officers or trading standards officers throughout Britain regarding the rigour of their approach to marking articles. It may surprise him to learn, as it did me when I read it, that more than half the articles of precious metal hallmarked in this country are struck with common control marks rather than the traditional UK hallmarks. If the hon. Gentleman has watched the "Antiques Roadshow", as perhaps we all have, he will know that it thrives on wonderful pottery made in Stoke masquerading as Ming dynasty pottery and that the interchange of precious articles, be they jewels, gold or pottery, across the world has an ancient genesis and I suspect it has taken place since people began trading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can tell the hon. Member for Rochford and Southend, East that that is the crux of the issue. For better or worse—he may think that it is for the worse; I think that it is for the better—the trading of goods will become more prevalent rather than less so. We must ensure the consumers in this country can understand the significance of hallmarks that have been made elsewhere. It is important that we should—as the hon. Member for North Shropshire put it—raise Europe's standards up to ours instead of facing a decrease in the amounts of information that we are able to give to consumers, thereby weakening their abilities as customers in shops and as consumers of these products.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to answer my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, South (Mr. Pearson). I cannot remember when I last went into a jewellery shop to buy anything. I am always told that that is because my ancestors are from Cardiganshire—the Cardigan-Pembroke border—and that I am therefore too tight to do so. However, if I were to do so, I should look carefully at British products before any other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The concern remains as to whether the Government are unequivocally committed to ensuring that there will always be independently tested marks in this country. The precious metals directive, as currently drafted, would allow marks which have not been the subject of independent certification to be on precious goods circulating in this country. Will the Minister confirm that the Government will ensure the continuation of independent testing, as the leaflet states?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The regulations do not dilute that commitment in any way. Indeed, article 30 does not outlaw hallmarking. The Houtwipper judgment has confirmed that hallmarking is legitimate for the protection of the consumers, wherever it takes place. That is why the regulations will reinforce hallmarking by recognising equally valid systems in Europe and not recognising systems that are inferior.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Christchurch has made an important point. I hope that he recognises that the regulations strengthen the hallmarking system; they do not take away the ability or right of manufacturers and

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Chope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister assure the Committee that the Government will continue to oppose the current draft of the precious metals directive?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
