Draft Professions Supplementary to Medicine (Clinical Scientists Board) Order of Council 1999</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>4.33 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Health (Mr. John Denham)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Professions Supplementary to Medicine (Clinical Scientists Board) Order of Council 1999.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the draft Professions Supplementary to Medicine (Speech and Language Therapists Board) Order of Council 1999 and the draft Professions Supplementary to Medicine (Paramedics Board) Order of Council 1999.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The orders extend state registration under the Professions Supplementary to Medicine Act 1960 to the professions of speech and language therapists, clinical scientists and paramedics. We considered the case for each group on its merits. Their very diversity highlights the enormous range of skill and dedication deployed in the modern health care team.<br><br>
Some members of this Committee were members also of the Standing Committee that considered the Health Bill, which recently spent many hours debating the need to strengthen and modernise professional self-regulation. The nine professions that are already state-registered are united in warmly supporting the proposal to widen the scope of the regulations to include the three professions that we are debating today. I know that the professions are all anxious to make progress and to update the framework within which they work.<br><br>
The Health Bill will allow the Government to consult on proposals to bring existing legislation up to date and will reflect the enormous changes in health care provision, professional practice and education that have occurred since the enactment of the 1960 Act. It is right to proceed with the order, not only because of the work that the relevant professions have put into building a case for registration but because they and the public will benefit at the outset from any revised statutory framework.<br><br>
Speech and language therapists work across the range of communication disorders, although the majority work with children. Communication problems may result from learning difficulties, stroke, head injuries, cancer of the mouth and throat and degenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease. Speech and language therapists enable clients to communicate to the best of their ability by assessing
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
the nature of the problem and providing treatment, advice and support, sometimes through sign language, communication aids or other methods of communication. They work closely with families, carers and members of other professions in a wide range of settings.<br><br>
Clinical scientists apply scientific principles to the delivery and development of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and services, working closely with medical staff and other health care professionals. They develop equipment, participate in problem-orientated research and development and are involved in the audit of the services provided. Clinical scientists practice in one of several disciplines, including audiology, biomedical engineering, clinical biochemistry, clinical physiology, clinical microbiology, embryology, genetics, haematology, immunology and medical physics, working in different ways depending on the speciality. Some clinical scientists interact directly with patients and others give advice on which critical decisions are based.<br><br>
Paramedics provide immediate care for patients in acute clinical emergencies. They systematically assess, treat and monitor patients according to national clinical protocols, adapted to the requirements of local communities. The treatments provided include invasive procedures such as intravenous cannulation, incubation, the insertion of chest drains and the administration of a specified range of emergency medication, including analgesics. Paramedics would typically be the first health professionals on hand in an emergency.<br><br>
The broad effect of the order would be to extend the 1960 Act to those professions, alongside the nine that it already covers. Each order establishes a professional board within the umbrella of the Council for Professions Supplementary to Medicine. The function of the boards will be to promote high standards of professional education and conduct, within the framework of the CPSM, which has the duty to co-ordinate and supervise the activities of all boards. Each board will also have a duty to prepare and maintain a register, approve institutions, courses of training and qualifications leading to state registration, determine applications for admission to the register on the basis of qualifications and experience obtained, in the UK or elsewhere and set up investigating and disciplinary committees to produce guidance on conduct and deal with individual cases of misconduct. Once registered, practitioners will be entitled to call themselves state-registered speech and language therapists, state-registered clinical scientists or state-registered paramedics. The use of those titles by unregistered persons will be an offence, as will the use of any title or description that falsely implies that someone is registered under the 1960 Act.<br><br>
The Act requires that the board should have a majority of members from the professions concerned. The boards will each have a total of 15 members appointed by the CPSM, of whom nine will be nominated in the first instance by the profession and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0568">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
thereafter elected by registrants. The remaining members will include medical practitioners, educationalists—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Philip Hammond <span class='memberconstituency'>(Runnymede and Weybridge)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has told us that once the order is passed, the professions in question will benefit from protection of common title but he also told the Committee on the Health Bill that the Professions Supplementary to Medicine Act is inadequate, particularly in regard to protection of common title. Why has the Minister chosen to make the order under the Act, rather than waiting for the new legislation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For clarification, I did not say that the order will lead to protection of common title because it will not. It will lead to protection of the title of "state-registered". Given the imminence of the Health Bill and its order-making powers, we consider whether it would be better for the protection of the public, which is the central issue that we are addressing, to proceed with registration under the 1960 Act, thereby putting these professions, which have developed to the point at which they should be registered, in a good position to benefit from the new changes, or whether it would be better to take no further action until the order-making powers under the Health Bill could be used.<br><br>
We took the view that in the interests of the protection of the public, it was better to move ahead, even though some way down the line, further changes will need to be made, as we discussed during the Committee stage of the Health Bill.</span></p>
<p>4.40 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Evan Harris <span class='memberconstituency'>(Oxford, West and Abingdon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: While we are on the subject of the protection of common title, it is a good time to question the Minister about his future intentions with regard to the protection of title. He said that all that can be protected under the existing legislation is the title, "state registered", and we discussed during the proceedings on the Health Bill whether it was possible to protect the actual title, such as physiotherapist, as well. Will the Minister clarify whether he envisages that the statement will include not merely the words "clinical scientist" for that group, but will include hospital physicist, clinical biochemist and clinical geneticist, so that the public are not duped simply because the words "state registered" are not on the plaque?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be wrong to suggest that we have resolved the question that we discussed in Committee about the range of titles that should be protected. I freely acknowledge that it is an important point that will have to be considered for each profession, especially when the use of a common alternative title is perhaps increasing. In the Health Committee, we discussed the development of the term "physical therapist" as an alternative to physiotherapist.<br><br>
It is not an issue that I would dismiss, but it is one that needs to be examined carefully as we develop the order-making powers and use them for each
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
profession. We may have to revisit the issue from time to time if new terms are used. We discussed the difficulty of putting into legislation the protection of generic titles, such as "practitioner". I acknowledge the point made by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abindgon (Dr. Harris) and accept that we shall have to consider the matter carefully in consultation with the professions when we come to use the order-making powers under the Health Bill.<br><br>
I was discussing the make-up of the members of the board in each case. Eight from the profession concerned will form a majority. They will be nominated by the profession in the first instance and elected thereafter by registrants. The remaining members will include medical practitioners, educationalists, representatives with special interests in each profession and, in a development strongly supported by the Government, representatives of employers, patients and carers.<br><br>
If each measure is approved, the membership of the CPSM will also increase from 27 to 36 because the Act requires that all boards have a professional representative on the council, and that the number of medical and professional members should be equal. The third lay member of each board preserves the balance of representation between professional, medical and other members.<br><br>
Statutory regulation is a privilege and should not be granted merely because the profession concerned aspires to it. It should be justified because it provides safeguards to the public that would not otherwise be available. We are satisfied that unlicensed practice in any of those fields has the potential to harm patients and that state registration provides better protection for patients and the general public.<br><br>
Currently 7,500 speech and language therapists are registered with the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists. The training required is exacting and the route to qualification is a four-year honours degree course, leading to a certificate to practice issued by the college. Speech and language therapists work with some of the most vulnerable members of the population, including children in pre-school settings, nurseries and community clinics, and in mainstream and special schools, with children who have communicated difficulties that may be part of a physical, learning or emotional difficulty. Some of the children seen may have autistic spectrum, stammering or severe language disorders, which make access to the school curriculum difficult. Adults with learning difficulties may be seen in their own homes, while adults with neurological problems may be seen in an acute hospital setting.<br><br>
Perhaps the most common danger to the public is the promise of easy cures or simplistic diagnosis, leading to psychological damage, financial loss and deterioration in the patient's condition. Patients and their carers need to know that a registered speech and language therapist will offer a service based on accredited training and professional guidelines, and that complaints will be appropriately dealt with.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0569">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
The national health service in Great Britain employs an estimated 2,500 clinical scientists, of whom 1,700 are voluntarily registered. All entrants to basic training require a first degree in an approved science subject. Following the satisfactory completion of designated vocational training, graduates are eligible to join the voluntary register held by the Registration Council for Scientists in Health Care.<br><br>
Clinical scientists work with a broad range of patient groups, from before birth to extreme old age. Most clinical conditions directly or indirectly involve the services of clinical scientists, who provide advice directly to doctors, and apply scientific principles to the delivery and development of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and services. It follows that clinical scientists have a great capacity to do harm if they lack or misapply the skills required of them. Protection of the public can be achieved only if high standards of education, training and conduct are applied to ensure that clinical scientists are competent to practise.<br><br>
An estimated 9,000—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Harris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister moves away from clinical scientists, I should like to ask when registration will take place under the order. Under the voluntary scheme, applicants may become clinical scientists on completion of their first degree, but receive more specific, vocational training only after they are employed. Does he envisage provisional registration, as occurs in medicine, on taking a clinical scientist post, before full registration later? If so, that will have implications for comments that I shall make later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with that matter at greater length in response to the hon. Gentleman's questions. One of the functions of the boards and the CPSM is entry to the professions, so that will be determined through the system of professional self-regulation. However, I shall respond with the latest thinking about how the system is likely to develop when I reply to the debate.<br><br>
Some 9,000 qualified paramedics provide an integral part of pre-hospital care. All entrants to training are required to complete a 400 to 600-hour course at ambulance service centres. Syllabus qualifications and awards are supervised nationally by the Institute of Health and Care Development, which issues a paramedics certificate for people who demonstrate professional competence at the conclusion of the training programme. The profession promotes and manages effective and efficient ambulance services in the public sector, and tries to develop education and training for higher standards of pre-hospital care.<br><br>
The practice of paramedics routinely involves invasive or risky procedures. The capacity for harm by staff who are inadequately trained or inexperienced is considerable. Paramedics act on their own initiative and exercise their own judgment, often in an unsupervised capacity.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
Each of the professions has consulted widely on the proposals. The professions have balloted their members, who overwhelmingly supported them. The proposals are fully endorsed by the CPSM, which has secured the support of all nine of its existing boards.<br><br>
The professions have also canvassed support from a wide range of other health professions. The sole expressions of anxiety have come from the Institute of Biomedical Science, and two non-NHS ambulance services. The IBMS supported state registration of clinical scientists, but favoured a joint board for them and for medical laboratory scientific officers, who are already covered by the 1960 Act. Similarly, the ambulance services support state registration of paramedics, but want to strengthen participation by non-NHS staff in spheres such as access to and recognition of training.<br><br>
We accept that scope exists for closer collaboration between the professions and the boards, which we have strongly encouraged them to pursue. Equally, we are satisfied that it would be wrong to lose the immediate benefits to the public of proceeding now.<br><br>
The merits of state registration begin and end with the patient. State registration offers the public an objective assurance of the high standards of training, conduct and practice to be expected. It also offers incidental benefits, such as providing a benchmark for employers; assisting work force planning, by enabling a continuous record of appropriately qualified staff to be kept; offering an opportunity to strengthen collaboration between the family of health professions; and providing a coherent mechanism to deal with overseas-qualified practitioners, including those from the European Economic Area who want to exercise their rights to freedom of movement.<br><br>
The Government are committed to promoting excellence in the NHS through the introduction of clinical governance and to ensuring the protection of patients and the public. More open and accountable systems of professional self-regulation have an integral part to play in those aims, and we want to work with the professions to develop and strengthen them.<br><br>
The CPSM has striven over the years to improve its accessibility. It is responsible for 103,000 registered practitioners. Adding these professions will further increase the number of registrants and provide an opportunity for the CPSM to play a leading role in strengthening public protection. The orders will provide a scheme of self-regulation at arm's length from Government, funded by practitioners themselves. We are satisfied that the three professions have developed sufficient standards, identies and purposes to join the family of mature professions regulated by the CPSM. I commend to the Committee the making of these orders by the Privy Council.</span></p>
<p>4.51 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed that we have been asked to consider all three orders in a single debate. The Minister will recall that, during the debates on the Health Bill in Standing Committee, I asked him how the orders made under the new legislation would be dealt with and expressed the hope that they would not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0570">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
be pushed into Committee in great batches with inadequate time for consideration. He gave us an assurance that that would not happen with the new legislation. Therefore, it is strange that the tail end of the old regime should be used to force through three orders on the regulation of three important professions and many thousands of professionals in a single one-and-a-half hour debate.<br><br>
Although I accept that the orders are relatively straightforward, various issues need to be explored, including general issues relating to the use of the current legislation in these circumstances and specific issues on the individual orders. I know, for example, that my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley) has a great deal of knowledge about clinical scientists and has much that he would like to say. Undoubtedly, we shall not have enough time in Committee today to explore such matters in as much detail as we should have liked.<br><br>
All three professions are extremely worthy. They do a fantastic job in the national health service and, indeed, some of their members work outside the NHS. Anything that I say today in questioning the Government's motives for pushing forward these three professions, rather than the others that have a similar claim, should not be interpreted as casting any doubt on their validity or value. However, we must consider such matters in the wider context of the many other aspirant professions that seek similar registration.<br><br>
As the Minister said, we had an opportunity to discuss the basis of, and reasons for, professional registration in debates on the Health Bill in Committee. Those reasons are well understood. The power to self-regulate is the essence of the professions. The protection of title is an important aspect, as is the ability to impose discipline and entry standards and to operate and maintain a register of those entitled to practise. All those matters taken together form the basis for public confidence in any profession.<br><br>
We must, however, consider the orders in the context of the Health Bill, which may receive its Third Reading next Monday and then return to the House of Lords for further consideration. The Health Bill will abolish the Professions Supplementary to Medicine Act 1960 under which the Orders of Council will be made. The Government have stated their intention to create a health professions council to replace the Council for Professions Supplementary to Medicine, but in Committee the Minister was unable to suggest when the council would be set up or to assure us that it would be in the lifetime of this Parliament. When a Minister cannot say that something is likely to happen in the lifetime of a Parliament, most of us take that as a suggestion that it is unlikely to happen in the lifetime of a Parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to intervene, and I will need to check the record, but I think that I said that we wanted to make progress as quickly as possible. I certainly did not promise that progress would be made in this Parliament, but the hon. Gentleman may have misread what I said to suggest that the Government believe that progress would not be made in this Parliament. I do not want to give that impression.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I have misinterpreted the Minister's remarks and that, come the next general election, I am able to say to him, "I'm sorry that I was wrong about that, I'm delighted that you were able to get those things through before you left office." The interpretation that I put on the Minister's remarks was that we could not rely on the matters being dealt with during this Parliament.<br><br>
The Health Bill will replace the regime for professional registration and regulation currently in primary legislation with a regime to be founded in secondary legislation. It is imporant that the Committee understands that the number of professions that can be registered is limited to 12 under the existing Professions Supplementary to Medicine Act 1960. In one fell swoop the available slots are being filled, only 22 days before the Health Bill envisages that section 10 of the Professions Supplementary to Medicine Act will cease to have effect, and thus the entry door will slam closed. From that point onwards, once the 12 existing professional slots are filled, no more professions will be able to gain entry to registered status until the Government have made the necessary orders to create the health professions council and subsequent orders to establish additional professional boards under it.<br><br>
Today, we must consider the arguments not only on the merits of the three professions to acquire registered status, but the comparative arguments for putting the three professions in "under the wire". I used the phrase before and the Minister objected to it, but pushing three Orders of Council through 22 days before the disablement of the legislation under which they will be made smacks of ducking something in under the wire.<br><br>
Why those three professions rather than other aspirants? That has to be a question of priorities. Which of the many professions that seek registration has the greatest claim on our attention? Given the Minister's evident dissatisfaction with the existing arrangements, never mind the limit of 12 professions, why is it necessary to push the measures through under the old regime, which has been found inadequate and which the Government have introduced measures to replace? In Committee, the Minister said that clause 54 of the Health Bill would
<br><blockquote><p>"improve and modernise the arrangements for professional self-regulation of the health care professions."</p></blockquote>
Later, he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"the Professions Supplementary to Medicine Act 1960 is inadequate, particularly in the area of protection of common title. While the title "state-registered chiropodist" is protected, any individual can set up practice calling himself a "chiropodist" … As a priority, we will use the order-making power to replace the 1960 Act with a stronger, more modern self-regulatory system, as recommended by the indepedent review in 1996."—<i>[Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 20 May 1999; c. 914–5.]</p></blockquote>
I accept much of the Ministers criticism of the present arrangements, but he has not made his case for using that old-fashioned, outmoded and "inadequate" legislative regime to push through the orders today for those three professions.<br><br>
Why those three professions? The Minister told the Standing Committee that
<br><blockquote><p>"Those professions had already expressed a wish to come under
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0571">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
the 1960 Act when the independent review was announced so they have been waiting for some time."</p></blockquote>
The Minister then told the Committee that
<br><blockquote><p>"The Government believe that those professions are ready for self-regulation and have accepted the CPSM recommendation."—<i>[Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 20 May 1999; c. 937.]</p></blockquote>
The criterion should not be the wishes of one profession when other professions are competing for scarce space—only three slots are available—but the need to protect the public. A comparative analysis is required.<br><br>
I did not hear the Minister say anything that sounded like a comparative analysis of the claims to those three professions against the claims of other aspirant professions. Other members of the Committee may have been more fortunate, but it is noteworthy that I have received no papers for today's debate. I have not received copies of the petitions made by the professions; I have not received copies of the objections that the Minister referred to so briefly; I have not received copies of evaluations of the cases made by those professions; and I have not received copies of the Department's comparative studies of the claims of the three professions against the claims of other professions. I suggest that the Committee is disastrously ill-prepared for the task before it.<br><br>
That contrasts rather sharply with the procedure that will be used when orders are made under the new legislation. When an order is made under the Health Bill, the explanatory notes to the Bill state that
<br><blockquote><p>"The consultation will be on the basis of the draft. He"—</p></blockquote>
that is the Secretary of State—
<br><blockquote><p>"must publish the proposed Order in draft three months before it is laid before Parliament. Following consultation a draft Order will be laid before Parliament… and must be accompanied by a report about the consultation."</p></blockquote>
It seems to me that the Committee would have benefited from a more detailed and rigorous explanation of why the Government had allowed the registration of those three professions rather than others that aspired to registration.<br><br>
If the only significance of getting those three professions under the wire is that, under the old legislation, the freeze-out means that after 1 July or after the orders have been made, no other professions would be able to register until the necessary further orders have been made, which may be quite a long time, we should consider all the other applicants for those three slots. We should consider the priorities, including patient protection. Such consideration would, of course, take account of the circumstances in which the members of the various professions found themselves working, and of whether they had access to controlled and dangerous substances; it would have to take account also of the numbers of people involved in the professions, and thus the public's exposure to them.<br><br>
I suspect—I cannot make a rigorous analysis because I do not have the data to do so—that ambulance paramedics would readily qualify under those criteria. However, I am not so sure about speech
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
and language therapists—who belong to a worthy profession, as I have acknowledged. Has the Minister evidence of people coming to serious harm or dying as a result of the profession being unregulated? What evidence is there of a threat to the public? How has the Minister evaluated that threat and compared it with that of lack of registration in other professions? The Minister will know my interest in operating department practitioners and clinical perfusion—a profession that we discussed in the Health Committee—where there is clear evidence of harm to members of the public as a result of an inadequate regulatory regime.<br><br>
I emphasise that nothing that I have said should be taken as detracting from the importance of the work done by speech and language therapists. However, we should consider the risks to the public from improper regulations of the profession.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Lansley <span class='memberconstituency'>(South Cambridgeshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not have the privilege of sitting on the Health Committee, but in referring to the discussions in that Committee on clinical perfusionists and the protection of the public, does my hon. Friend have in mind the particularly sad case of baby Hannah Shepherd, as reported to the Department of Health by Her Majesty's coroner? Sir Magdi Yacoub, president of the Society of Perfusionists, wrote to the Department and said in his letter:
<br><blockquote><p>"The practice and science of cardiopulmonary bypass has evolved to such a degree that it now deserves to be recognised and strictly regulated … Compared with other professionals already regulated I cannot think of a group who have a higher level of responsibility."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention and for quoting from such an eminent source as Sir Magdi Yacoub. That is the point that I am making. Members of the Committee, who are charged with scrutinising the orders, are asking the Minister to substantiate his case. Where is his analysis of the competing claims? How has he determined that the claims of speech and language therapists are of greater priority in terms of protecting the public than those of clinical perfusionists? By what method has he evaluated and dismissed the opinion of Sir Madgi Yacoub, among others? If we are to have transparent government, we must be satisfied that a rational appraisal of the competing claims has been made and that the three professions have been found to have the greatest claim for inclusion in the limited number of slots available under the legislation. Nothing that I have heard reassures me that the rigorous comparative analysis that we are entitled to expect has been made.<br><br>
The issue of clinical scientists is somewhat different because of their inter-relationship with medical laboratory technicians, who are already included within the 1960 Act, clinical perfusionists—who, as we have said, are not included and will continue to be excluded under the new legislation—and other groups of scientific and technical staff. In the increasingly technological environment of our hospitals, there is an argument for all scientific and technical staff to be regulated—and certainly an argument for some form of unified body to cover those professions.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0572">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
I am not an expert on this subject, unlike my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire, and I do not intend to go into great detail, as he will no doubt have something to say about it later. Where are the appraisals? Where are the evaluations? What other professions has the Department evaluated in reaching the decision to push these three statutory instruments forward? The Committee is being asked to make a decision today without evidence or evaluation.<br><br>
Important issues of prioritisation are involved. We are talking about an Act that has been in force since 1960. Originally, six or seven professions were included, and in the 39 years of its existence, another two have been included. Now, in the last 22 days of its existence, the Minister is asking us to approve the inclusion of another three professions. Perhaps I have a suspicious mind, but I cannot help it. The Government have already identified the existing regime as flawed and have introduced measures to replace it. After 39 years, in which nine professions have been registered, the Government feel that it is now appropriate in the last three weeks of the life of that legislation to squeeze in another three professions. If the only significance of that was the possibility of other professions being frozen out for a period after the 1 July deadline under the Health Bill, that, in itself, would be a significant issue.<br><br>
There is not only the problem of prioritisation of applications from different professions to get in ahead of the deadline, but the further question of the creation in perpetuity of a two-tier system of professional regulation. Professions that are regulated under the Professions Supplementary to Medicine Act—the nine professions already regulated, plus the three that we are being asked to approve today—will always have a different regime from those that will be regulated under orders to be made under the Health Bill. The old professions—those under the Professions Supplementary to Medicine Act—will always have a single regulatory regime, covering the whole of the United Kingdom. The regulation of those professions will remain a reserved matter in terms of the Scotland Act 1998.<br><br>
The regulatory regime of the new professions— those that are first regulated under the new Health Bill—will be a devolved matter. There is at least the possibility, or the inevitability in the longer run, of a divergence between the regulatory regime that will apply in England and Wales and the regime that will apply in Scotland.<br><br>
We debated the issue at some length in the Health Committee and I do not intend to go into it in any further detail at present. However, it is worth bearing in mind the fact that a divergence between the regulatory system in Scotland and that in England and Wales must increase the risk to patients. There will be an increased risk of gaps through which rogue operators can slip. Once again, we should focus our minds on ensuring that the professions that will be regulated under the tighter regime under the Professions Supplementary to Medicine Act are those involving the greatest risk to the public.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
The Minister has consistently denied that there will be a difference in the regime between Scotland and England and Wales. During the Committee's deliberations, the Minister said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We intend to continue to apply UK-wide provision to the professions so that patients are afforded the same protection wherever they live. There are to be no artificial barriers to free movement of professionals within the UK."—<i>[Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 20 May 1999; c. 932.]</p></blockquote>
Unfortunately for the Minister, the Labour party did not win outright in the Scottish elections, so he cannot say that there will be a single regulatory regime. Even if the Minister's Liberal Democrat fellow travellers are happy to agree with him now, he will have to acknowledge that there is a power for the Scotish Parlaiment to set up a separate regulatory regime for the professions that are first regulated under the new Health Bill. It is possible—it will be surprising if it does not happen in practice—that over time, those professions will eventually have separate regulaory regimes with divergences between the practice in England and Wales and the practice in Scotland. It is arrogant of the Government to assume that they will always control both ends of the pipeline and ensure that whatever they want to put in place in England and Wales can be mirrored in Scotland.<br><br>
I a further question for the Minister, which is relevant to the general issue of the regulation of professions supplementary to medicine. Will the existing professions, including the three that we are now considering, retain the rights of appeal to the Privy Council when the Council for Professions Supplementary to Medicine has been replaced by the health professions council, or have the Government decided that the successor body should lose those rights?<br><br>
If the professions supplementary to medicine are to retain those rights, it will futher emphasise the distinction between those that are regulated under the old regime, including the three that we are considering today, and those that will be regulated in the future.<br><br>
There has been a woeful lack of a coherent argument for prioritising these three cases. We heard from the Minister good arguments, with which I do not take issue for a moment, about the value of those professions and their readiness to take on full professional self-regulatory status and the excellent work that they do. That is not enough. We need to set it in a comparative context and understand how the Minister reached the conclusion that those professions, above all others that are currently unregistered, should be the ones to be bulldozered through in the last few days in the life of the Professions Supplementary to Medicine Act—at least, section 10 of that Act.<br><br>
The Minister has made a case for changing the system in the Health Bill. Provided that Members in another place do not decide to disrupt the Government's intentions, we shall have in place a shiny new system of registration powers over the health professions. Why does not the Minister wait? He need wait only for a few weeks, and then, instead of using what he has described as inadequate provisions, he can use the shiny new provisions that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0573">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
have been tailored to his every requirement. That would have the additional benefit of putting the Government under pressure to get the necessary orders made to set up the health professions council and the professional boards. I fear that by pushing these three measures through under the wire, the Minister is trying to remove some of the pressure that would otherwise be on him and his colleagues to set up and activate the new regime under the Health Bill.<br><br>
For better or worse, professional regulation of those professions that are not already regulated will be a devolved matter under the Scotland Act. I am not a Member of the Scottish Parliament, but if I were recently elected as such and realised that a devolved responsibility, such as the regulation of professions, included the caveat that any profession regulated before 1 July 1999 would be forever a reserved matter dealt with at Westminster, I would think that what the Minister is doing—pushing through these three orders in the dying days of the old legislation—was not in keeping with the spirit of devolution and the Scotland Act.<br><br>
Unless the Minister intends to make orders under section 30 of the Scotland Act, so that, notwithstanding the Health Bill, other professions brought into regulation later will be treated as reserved matters, today's action represents a breach of good faith with the people of Scotland, given the Government's intentions in drafting the Scotland Act. I hope that the Minister will deal with those matters and that, despite the lack of circulated papers and information, the Committee will do its best, perhaps with the benefit of the Minister's input, to consider the issues on their merit and in a comparative context.</span></p>
<p>5.21 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Harris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I pay tribute to all the important professions that we are discussing. They have been of immense help in my clinical practice. I do not think that much is to be gained by our trying to work out the relative risks or merits of registration and the inclusion of these professions rather than others. Those matters should be evaluated, but it is difficult for us to do so on the basis of gut instinct.<br><br>
For example, although speeech and language therapists do not seem to be involved in risky therapies, they deal with vulnerable people and often work in isolation, with little of the perhaps inadequate clinical oversight experienced by clinical perfusionists working in a busy unit. Some of the judgments that speech or language therapists make about the ability of very sick patients to swallow can be a matter of life and death. If their diagnosis is wrong, inhalation pneumonia could result because of the premature feeding of someone who could not swallow. It is difficult for those of us who are not in those roles to make judgments.<br><br>
The points made by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) are generally correct. One must ask why the three professions have been chosen now, after such a wait,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
and whether, because of their inclusion, the Government will think that including other professions is not a matter of urgency. I would include psychologists in the list that the hon. Gentleman mentioned, because we are talking about not only quasi-therapeutic or pseudo-therapeutic interventions, but the risk of misleading people into thinking that techniques are efficacious, some of which might not be.<br><br>
Of course, there is little efficacy in techniques performed by those with inadequate training who are not acting in patients' best interests. That is a problem with some groups who describe themselves as psychologists, and with other groups. That is why there is a move for properly trained clinical psychologists to be registered. Patients have more contact with those groups than with clinical scientists, who usually have no direct contact with patients and work with clinically qualified staff.<br><br>
Paramedics are an extremely important group, not only for the work that they do, but because of the work that they might do. It is now clear that early intervention is important, especially in trauma cases. That puts the onus on the paramedic first on the scene to give that intervention, whether it be cannulation, the insertion of a chest drain or perhaps, in future, the giving of life-saving treatments such as clot-busting drugs. Ideally, a surgeon or doctor would be on the scene immediately, but given the recruitment crisis in those professions, it is unlikely that we shall ever have the number of people required to provide that sort of service. Indeed, rural areas must not only have adequately trained and regulated paramedics, but sufficient of them to provide those functions. That will make a big difference to the outcome of cases, which is what it is all about.<br><br>
I wonder whether the Government have given any thought as to whether the order will increase more easily the number of people seeking to become paramedics, by giving the profession a higher status, or whether they envisage short or medium-term recruitment or qualification problems because of the more onerous duties that might apply. That may be difficult to forecast, but I would be interested to know what impact the Minister and his advisers believe the order might have on the staffing shortfall. That, of course, applies not only to paramedics, but to speech and language therapists and others.<br><br>
I am concerned mainly about registering clinical scientists under a single board. I question the Minister's intentions with regard to that profession and the associated profession of biomedical science, represented by the Institute of Biomedical Science. Medical laboratory technicians and medical laboratory scientific offiers—MLSOs—are an important group. However, it is fair to say that they and others are worried about the registration of clinical science.<br><br>
That important group of scientific laboratory staff has significant recruitment and retention problems. Indeed, in a written answer yesterday, the Minister said that
<br><blockquote><p>"the Whitley Council … has been discussing MLSO pay in the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0574">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
light of reported recruitment and retention problems and will meet on 10 June to consider the … management side's offer to substantially improve the pay".—<i>[Official Report,</i> 8 June 1999; Vol. <i>332,</i> c. <i>283.]</i></p></blockquote>
The problem is recognised, but the Minister must be careful not to antagonise a group who feel that they have a right to be consulted. MLSOs and clinical scientists feel that their futures are inextricably linked and that they should share entry qualifications, education and functions. I shall take the Minister through some of the worries passed to me by the Institute of Biomedical Science and others. Many of the functions of MLSOs and clinical scientists are similar, but not in every way. Indeed, the description that the Minister gave in his introduction to our debate did not necessarily distinguish between those functions that were common and those that should be common. It is thought that clinical scientists may have a direct clinical involvement that MLSOs do not have, but even in the NHS, it can be hard to tell who is doing what job, and why someone is not doing a job that is being done by someone who is similarly qualified.<br><br>
The key point is that, unlike other professions, those two medical science professions have similar core entry qualifications. For instance, nurses and midwives both have graduate entry, but not necessarily with further post-graduate qualification. A cohort of biochemistry graduates may go into either the MLSO profession or clinical science, whereas one might argue for entirely separate boards for nurses and midwives because the entry qualfications are different; a separate register is needed ab initio. I know that the Minister believes that many functions in nursing and midwifery can be covered by a single council. Indeed, we discussed that matter when debating the Health Bill. However, if one accepts that things should be done jointly, the argument is quite strong for registration to be combined.<br><br>
Anxieties have been expressed about inadequate consultation with intereseted groups, including—but not restricted to—biomedical scientists, who feel strongly that they want joint arrangements. I should have thought that it would be automatic for the CPSM, outside its final decision-making body, formally to consult them through their institute to ensure that there view was considered. I have read letters that say that such consultation would take place, but I have an understanding—which I believe the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire, who may want to add to my comments, shares—that it did not.<br><br>
Biomedical scientists are also worried that separate, as opposed to joint, registration might work against the concepts of staff flexibility and fitness for purpose, which are central to the current NHS executive agenda. Indeed, at times of staff and skill shortages, I should have thought that the NHS has an interest in ensuring, without a diminution of quality, flexibility between who carries out various functions, so long as certain quality criteria are met.<br><br>
The proposal for separate registration seems to ignore the findings and recommendations of the Evetsin research project into the evaluation of vocational training of science graduates, which the NHS executive commissioned. Among other
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
recommendations, its report strongly suggested that there should be more joint postgraduate educational working. It also suggested that separate registration might cause confusion and difficulty in the provision of education for NHS-employed scientists, and might encourage the education and training programmes of biomedical and clincial scientists to diverge at a time when common issues and agendas are being sought.<br><br>
A view has been expresed that the proposal goes against the views of, or, at least, stimulates the anxieties of, other key pathology professional bodies such as the Royal College of Pathologists and the Association for Clinical Pathologists, from which I have received a letter saying that it is worried. I was rather surprised that the Minister did not include some of those groups in the list of people who opposed the proposal. Perhaps that information has not been passed on to him through the council, which has been criticised for not consulting widely on the proposal. Other anxieites have also been expressed.<br><br>
That alarm is shared by some important people, such as the Chief Scientific Officer of the Department of Health, Dr. Peter Greenaway. In a widely-copied letter of 6 October to the Council for Professions Supplementary to Medicine, he presented what he considered to be a compromise proposal. Like me, he supports the inclusion of clinical scientists and their professional self-regulation.<br><br>
Dr. Greenaway asked whether it would
<br><blockquote><p>"be possible to create, under the existing Act. a new Board either de novo or by drastically altering the name, remit and composition of the MLT Board"</p></blockquote>
that is, the board for biomedical scientists. In such circumstances, professions supplementary to medicine
<br><blockquote><p>"All Health Care Scientists (Biomedical Scientists, Clinical Scientists and those currently outside the frame such as clinical physiologists, medical physics technicians, perfusionists …) would be eligible to join subject to fulfilling the necessary criteria approved by the relevant professional body."</p></blockquote>
Dr. Greenaway said that he thought that that
<br><blockquote><p>"may seem a bit clumsy but if it was feasible it would solve a number of current issues as it would include all"</p></blockquote>
science and technical
<br><blockquote><p>"groups wishing to be registered whilst at the same time preserving professional boundaries and entry requirements. It would also provide the public safety and confidence required … The creation of a federated board may be difficult under the … PSM Act but it may still be worth considering. In any case, some of this ground will need to be"</p></blockquote>
considered
<br><blockquote><p>"once new legislation is put in place and so time spent in discussing practicalities now would not all be wasted."</p></blockquote>
That is why I am raising the issue now. Such anxieties about what might happen in future have been expressed not only by Dr. Peter Greenaway but by other people. Will the Minister give some relief to those anxieties?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lansley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman observed that one of the existing boards—for radiographers—is a joint board that embraces both radiographers with diagnostic responsibilities and those with therapeutic responsibilities? In many hospitals, the relationship between MLSOs and clinical scientists is that between a diagnostician and someone engaged in the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0575">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
therapeutic application of the same principles. To have two professions working under a joint board is not unknown under the Professions Supplementary to Medicine Act 1960.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Harris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right and that is a good analogy. In a letter to the Council for Professions Supplementary to Medicine last June, the pro-vice chancellor of research at the university of Ulster pointed out, exactly as the hon. Gentleman said, that there is a precedent in the radiographers board that:
<br><blockquote><p>"provides an overarching frame of reference for the quite distinct functions of diagnostic and therapeutic radiographers."</p></blockquote>
Given the sensitivities that appear to exist between clinical scientists and the MLSOs, he thought it appropriate for a joint board to be established as an interim measure. That would still enable separate registers for those who merit that through additional qualifications. From my experience of the health service, where there may be tensions between professionals doing similar jobs on different pay scales, continued separation of registration is not necessarily the best receipe for long-term harmony.<br><br>
I fear that the Minister might suffer continued difficulties in recruitment and retention if consideration is not given to that matter under the new arrangements. It chimes with what he said, in defence of my concerns relating to the treatment of the Royal College of Midwives and midwives generally, about wanting as much as possible to be generic. Where there are no different educational criteria at entry, it is hard to justify entirely separate councils, registers and processes of educational verification.<br><br>
Time is drawing short, the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire may want to contribute and the Minister may want to reply, so I shall give only one more example of such concerns. Professor Rogers, the chair of heads of university centres of biomedical science at the university of Portsmouth, wrote to the Clerk of the Privy Council in August and stated, as all those concerned have done, that it is appropriate and important that clinical scientists be registered soon. He says:
<br><blockquote><p>"HUCBMS is opposed. however, to the establishment of a new Board for clinical scientists separate to that for Medical Laboratory Scientific Offiers (MLSOs). Any justification for a clear distinction to be made between the roles of clinical scientists and MLSOs has long since disappeared if indeed it ever existed. Graduates from our member universities and colleges enter the Health Service as MLSOs or clinical scientists and there is no correlation between class of degree awarded and employment category."</p></blockquote>
Professor Rogers concludes:
<br><blockquote><p>"In view of these observations and irrespective of the adoption of a single spine structure for clinical scientists and MLSOs, HUCBMS can find no evidence to support separate Registration Boards for the two groups and believes that the best interests of patients and the Health Service can only be served by a single Board registering both groups."</p></blockquote>
That is also endorsed by the Association of Clinical Pathologists, which complains that it was not formally consulted.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
Will the Minister consider the issue? In a modern health service and within adequate quality standards, flexibility is increasingly needed. For a long time, I campaigned for nurses to be able to do jobs that were previously done by doctors—not doctor's jobs, but jobs done by doctors—and for doctors to do work that they had previously considered could be done by nurses only. Such jobs should depend on who is the most qualified or appropriate to give care at the time. The separation of the two groups for no good reason, certainly in terms entry registration, will damage the functioning of the health service in the long term.<br><br>
I have considered representation from the Association of Clinical Biochemists to get both sides of the story, and I see where it comes from. However, I believe on reflection that the representation made by the Institute of Biomedical Science is valid. I should be grateful if the Minister would suggest that the separation is not the final word on the subject and that he would be wiling to see some sort of joint board under the new legislation.</span></p>
<p>5.39 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lansley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not being a member of the Committee, I am grateful for your leave to have the opportunity to speak about the issues raised today, Mr. Jones.<br><br>
I share with my colleagues the general welcome to the Orders of Council, especially those for speech and language therapists and for ambulance paramedics. I shall confine my remarks to the Order of Council relating to clinical scientists. My hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge and the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon have covered much of the ground and I shall confine myself to a couple of points and leave time for the Minister to reply. As my hon. Friend said, we could have a substantial debate on each order and it may seem to those reading the report of our proceedings that our debate of the three orders has been unbalanced. I fear that that is a consequence of the Minister's decision to take the orders together rather than dealing with them separately.<br><br>
I should declare a family, rather than pecuniary, interest. My father was chairman of the Institute of Biomedical Science—when it was the Institute of Medical Laboratory Sciences—for some years and chairman of the Medical Laboratory Technicians Board for a decade, principally in the 1970s. Through his interest, and continuing interest, in those matters I have therefore taken a close interest in medical laboratory scientists—which, when he began his career, were called medical laboratory technicians, then medical laboratory technologists, then medical laboratory scientific officers.<br><br>
A reflection that arises from what the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon said is that those in the medical laboratory scientific professions will recall that one reason why people become clinical scientists was that, unlike medical laboratory technicians, they had a degree-based entry to the national health service. One of the changes that has occurred in recent decades is that the profession of MLSOs is now degree based. Considerable effort has rightly been made to try to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0576">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
ensure that MLSOs in the NHS receive the status and recognition that they deserve, given the degree of responsibility that they carry. As the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon said, that has implications for remuneration but I shall not dwell on that question now.<br><br>
It would be a retrograde step if the separate registration of clinical scientists meant the reintroduction of an inflexibility in and barrier between the professions of MLSOs and clinical scientists. We could run the risk—which has too often been run in the past—of creating a situation where those with primarily technological expertise do not rise to senior positions within the NHS. Flexibility between the professions provides the opportunity for those entering the NHS in a technological function to occupy positions of responsibility—even those, with additional training, involving a clinical relationship.<br><br>
I have several concerns—the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon referred to some of them—not about the proposal to register clinical scientists, which has considerable merit, but about the manner in which it is being undertaken. Those concerns include that mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge about the timing, but more importantly about the degree of consultation that has taken place and about how well the measure fites into the proposals that the Government are considering on the way in which professions in the NHS should regulate themselves.<br><br>
One of the matters to which the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon referred was the consultation document of April 1996 on the operation of the Professions Supplementary to Medicine Act. That document, and the advice upon which the relevant part of the Health Bill is based, advocate flexibility between the professions. That flexibility will be prejudiced by the change that the order would effect to the structure of professions. That view was also reflected in the evaluation of the vocational training of science graduates in the NHS, a project to which the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon referred.<br><br>
It would be burdensome to the Committee to deal with that project in detail, but it includes a helpful analysis of the relationship between the functions of clinical scientists and those of MLSOs. Those professions occupy some 37 separate categories, but there are only about six differences in the way in which they are asked to exercise their functions.<br><br>
As has been said, those differences are primarily in the relationship that the professions have with the clinicians. To put it in a nutshell, MLSOs work in laboratories, clinical scientists work all around hospitals and interact directly with clinicians. Therefore, it is clear that the two professions have a high degree of complementarity not only in their initial education and training, but in subsequent aspects of their work.<br><br>
That project's conclusions not only point to the need for the profession to have a clear identity, but make it clear that it is desirable that scientists and technicians can transfer easily from one profession to another, so
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
that their talents can be better used in the NHS for the benefit of patients. Anything in the registration process that impedes the transfer of staff between those groups is detrimental.<br><br>
As is often the case, more questions are asked than answers given in these debates. However, in introducing the proposals on clinical scientists, has the Department a clear understanding of the structure, skill mix and professional demarcations and descriptions that are proposed for the NHS? Generic titles, such as "health care scientists" or "clinical scientists in health care" have been suggested, but that it is not necessarily the best way forward.<br><br>
From the letter from the Chief Scientific Officer and from representations made to me, it seems that, even if one generic title for scientific staff in the NHs is not used, it should be possible to create a registration structure in which professions that retain a more distinct identity but have a high degree of complementarity are linked, maximising the flexibility for scientists to move between related disciplines.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will offer greater assurances than he has done so far, because I fear that the proposals will work against such a structure, whereas the Health Bill—for which the Minister has had responsibility in the House, and which will be debated again on the Floor of the House next Monday—is designed to create precisely the flexibility sought by many scientists working in the NHS.<br><br>
I want to leave time for the Minister to respond, but I shall refer to two other matters. The Minister will proceed with the orders unless he is persuaded otherwise during this debate. Whatever the outcome, clinical scientists should be registered. I have had a conversation with Professor Christopher Price, the professor of clinical pathology at the Royal London hospital. He is one of my constituents, but I do not speak on his behalf—our conversation was not sufficiently lengthy for me to do so. His description of the work done over serveral years to set up the voluntary register to which the Minister referred has persuaded me that clinical scientists have every grounds for securing state registration. However, from that conversation, it is also clear that we are dealing with clinical scientists and life scientists who are also physical scientists and physiologists. We are already dealing with groups who operate in related disciplines. It is all the more difficult, therefore, when one can see the relationship between life scientists, medical laboratory scientific officers and clinical pathologists, not to proceed down that path when the relationships, the complementarities and the overlaps are so many.<br><br>
Finally, to complete my trio of interests in this matter, Papworth hospital in my constituency is one of the leading heart and lung hospitals in the country. About 20 perfusionists are employed by Cambridge Perfusion Services Ltd, which is based at that hospital. That makes it the largest employer of clinical perfusionists in the country. Cambridge Perfusion Services has made strong representations to me, which date back to the autumn of 1998, and on which I have corresponded with the Department. It describes the role of perfusionists thus:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0577">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"During open-heart surgery Perfusionists are responsible for the patient's circulation whilst the heart and or lungs are being repaired … This also includes the control of the patient's oxygenation and temperature control, all of which is skilfully maintained using a combination of highly technical equipment.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Unlike other medical technical disciplines within the NHS, where the majority of their work is diagnostic, Clinical Perfusionists have direct intervention whose actions have a direct impact on the well-being of the patient."</p></blockquote>
The review of the Professions Supplementary to Medicine Act by JM Consulting Ltd was referred to by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon. On statutory regulation, the review stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"The key test is whether there is the potential for harm arising either from invasive procedures or application of unsupervised judgement made by the professional which can substantially impact on patient/client health or welfare."</p></blockquote>
It seems to me that perfusionists entirely match that criterion. As my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge makes clear, approving the orders would effectively close the door to the state registration of clinical pefusionists. They may not be many in number, but their work seems absolutely to fit the criteria for state registration. Will the Minister explain why he has proceeded with the orders, and not included clinical perfusionists?</span></p>
<p>5.25 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall endeavour, in the time available, to cover as many as I can of the points raised in this well-informed and useful debate.<br><br>
The orders rely on section 10 of the 1960 Act. Under that Act, if the CPSM considers it appropriate for the Act to be extended to a profession that appears to it to be supplementary to medicine but which is not already regulated under the Act, it can make a recommendation to that effect to the Privy Council.If the Privy Council agrees with the CPSM's recommendation, it may, by order, provide for the Act to have effect as though the profession were regulated under the Act. Before an order can be made, however. the CPSM and the Privy Council are required to consult any existing boards created under the Act that appear to them to be affected. The CPSM and the Privy Council have consulted all the boards existing before the order was laid. No order is to be made unless a draft has been laid before, and approved by, Parliament.<br><br>
I set out that legal position because, although a number of professions have, at some point in the past, made informal approaches to the CPSM with regard to regulation, only three—the three that we are discussing today—have been subject of formal petitions to the CPSM and recommendations from the CPSM to the Privy Council. In recent months, the Government have been faced with the question of whether to proceed with the petitions and recommendations that were in the pipeline, notwithstanding our intention to make changes to the regulations, or whether to say that those professions would have to wait until we had made the proposed changes. We have not had the choice to weigh, as the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge invited us to do, between those professions ad others that may be subject to self-regulation in future.<br><br>
We shall have to deal with some important areas of professional activity. Perfusionists have been cited as an example. We inted to write to all health authorities and NHS trusts, saying that they must ensure that the employment of clinical perfusionists is limited to people who are accredited by the Society of Perfusionists or to trainees under the direct supervision of an accredited perfusionist. In the short term, that measure should restrict employment to those people, and by taking that route, we can maintain a dialogue with the professions on the scope in the longer term for statutory regulation of clinical perfusionists.<br><br>
As we discussed in the Committee that considered the Health Bill, an opportunity to consider operating department practitioners may arise as a result of the review of support workers recommended by the review of the Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors Act 1997. That would give us some scope to examine whether the review recommendations might consider groups such as ODAs and ODPs.<br><br>
Regulation raises some important issues that are not, however, subject to our consideration this afternoon. Because of procedures involved and the way in which matters work through the pipeline, that choice is not being considered.<br><br>
It is important to acknowledge that even speech and language therapists, who are not, perhaps, as obvious a case as paramedics, present a risk to the public if they do not do the job properly. For example, a child who does not speak clearly needs a hearing test to rule out deafness. An untrained therapist could miss nodules or, perhaps, cancer of the vocal chords. Moreover, as the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon said, speech and language therapists also specialise in feeding and swallowing difficulties, so even what may seem to the layperson a non-threatening profession can have serious consequences if practitioners are not up to standard. I am aware of cases of speech and language therapists who have been struck off the existing register for various reasons but who are now involved in private practice, so we have grounds to be worried. To say that each of the professions under consideration has a justifiable case for state registration is not to say that we should not worry about other fields.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hammond</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister seems to imply that the council has the option of considering only those professions that have petitioned for extension of registration to them. I can find nothing in section 10 of the Professions Supplementary to Medicine Act 1960 that refers to petitioning. As the Minister said, that Act provides that if the council considers it appropriate, it may recommend to the Privy Council extension of the regime to additional professions. Why is he suggesting that the option to consider other professions is not available?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0578">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The procedure that the council chooses to adopt, through which recommendations to the Privy Council are made, relates only to the three professions under consideration. We are not discussing five recommendations to fit three places— indeed, the Privy Council would be breaching its responsibilities if it proposed that—on behalf of five professions and choosing among them. The choice is whether to proceed.<br><br>
All hon. Members who have spoken have recognised the intrinisic merit of the three professions in their own right. Our judgment was that it was better to proceed, albeit while acknowledging the inadequacies of the 1960 Act, with regulation of the three professions rather than simply to block any further activity until the replacement for the CPSM had been established and further orders had been passed. That was the right judgment, because a balance must be struck between improving regulation for professions that have developed to the point that these have, albeit under inadequate registration, and causing these three professions to wait. A substantial volume of work must be undertaken in establishing the replacement of the CPSM and a raft of draft orders— as the hon. Member for South Cambridgeshire described it in Committee—need to be introduced for a variety of professions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Lansley</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose—</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am concious of the time, and should like to refer to some of the points made specifically about clinical sciences.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lansley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrrupt the Minister, but I think that I should do so as I have an application from the Society of Perfusionist to the CPSM for admission to the board. It was submitted in June 1996 and revised in October 1998. I do not see that the society has not petitioned the CPSM precisely as the Minister says the other professions have done so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that I am right in saying that those three professions are the only ones that the CPSM has recommended to the Privy Council. That is what a Minister has to consider under the circumstances.<br><br>
There are important differences between clinical and biomedical scientists. For example, there are different entry requirements to the two registers. Biomedical science requires a degree and one year of vocational training, but clinical science requires an honours degree and four years' vocational training or six or more years of postgraduate experience.<br><br>
It is also important to acknowledge that we seek to encourage closer working between the two professions. We considered all the representations carefully, including the concerns expressed by the Institute of Biomedical Science around the career and education pathways for biomedical and clinical scientists. We are anxious that the boards and professions concerned should explore all possible avenues for closer joint working. I am pleased to say that Baroness Hayman has asked the chairman of the CPSM, Professor Brian Edwards. shortly to convene a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
meeting of all the interested organisations to explore the scope for greater collaboration. Several issues will be under consideration, including those of a joint secretariat, the exchange of observers and members, and a joint education forum.<br><br>
Although it has not been directly the subject of our discussion, there is also scope for further exploration and dialogue between all parts of the paramedic profession—<br><br>
