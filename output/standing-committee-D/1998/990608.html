Draft Army, Air Force and Naval Discipline Acts (Continuation) Order 1999</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for the Armed Forces (Mr. Doug Henderson)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Army, Air Force and Naval Discipline Acts (Continuation) Order 1999.</p></blockquote>
It is a great pleasure and privilege, Dr. Clark, to be a member of a Committee under your chairmanship. We have known each other for many years and I know that you will be extremely fair and even-minded when dealing with our debate—a view that is shared by other members of the Committee.<br><br>
The purpose of the order is to continue in force for a further year the Army Act 1955, the Air Force Act 1955 and the Naval Discipline Act 1957, which together provide the statutory basis for discipline in the three services. The Committee will be aware that, since 1961, an Armed Forces Bill has been brought before the House every five years with the primary purpose of continuing in force the Acts that provide the disciplinary powers of the three armed services.<br><br>
Each Armed Forces bill is an opportunity for the services and Parliament and, indeed, the Special Select Committee that is constituted to consider the Bill to review service discipline. Between each five yearly Bill, the disciplinary code is renewed annually by the continuation order procedure which involves an Order in Council that is approved by a resolution of each House. The Committee will be aware that the most recent Armed Forces Bill was considered and enacted in 1996. I am asking the Committee to give the necessary annual renewal to the discipline Acts by agreeing to the order.<br><br>
I also take this opportunity to advise the Committee of some of the changes that have been made to the service discipline structure and to provide an update on the progress that has been made on several social matters. Hon. Members may recall that, at the time of the passage through Parliament of the Armed Forces Act 1996, it was suggested that the death penalty should be abolished. In response, the Ministry of Defence carried out a fundamental review of the matter and, in July last year, my predecessor announced that it had been agreed that the death penalty for service offences should be abolished—as it was under the provisions of the Human Rights Act 1998. I am pleased to inform the Committee that the necessary legislative steps are being taken to effect that decision. However, detailed consequential amendments must be made to the service Acts and I am still considering how best to achieve that as soon as possible.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
I conclude my remarks by paying tribute to the men and women who serve in our armed forces. Their professionalism and dedication continue to be admired by the House and by the nation as a whole—a point that strikes me each time I visit service communities or communities, in general. Some personnel do, however, occasionally stray from the disciplined conduct to which we expect them to adhere, but they are exceptions. The majority of our men and women maintain excellent standards and should be recognised for that. The service discipline Acts are designed to create a suitable environment to enable that good order and discipline to be sustained. I therefore invite the Committee to approve the order.</span></p>
<p>4.34 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Key <span class='memberconstituency'>(Salisbury)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I echo the Minister's words and I wish to say what a pleasure it is to serve under your chairmanship, Dr. Clark, in this special Committee. It is sometimes assumed that a continuation order is a formality and not a subject for great debate. However, it is a particularly important subject and we should take it seriously. I am grateful to the Minister for flagging up some of the issues that have caught his attention during his time as Minister for the Armed Forces.<br><br>
I served on the Committee considering the Armed Forces Bill in 1996. I know what an important Bill it was for all three armed services. The way in which that Committee operates is unique; it is a lesson for the House. It turns itself from a Standing Committee into a Special Select Committee; it travels, takes evidence, listens to the forces in all three services and to their families; and then deliberates and reports to the House in a special report. It is, I suspect, an important way forward for other Committees of the House—indeed, there is already some progress in that direction—and, as someone who has had the privilege to work in the House for 16 years, I commend it.<br><br>
We read from time to time in the press of high profile disciplinary cases. Whether they be cases of soldiers misbehaving overseas or inter-service cases involving deep human emotions, traumas and problems, they do little to improve the image of the forces. That, of course, has an impact on recruitment and retention. Even if the subject is acquitted, high profile courts martial can sometimes end in administrative discharge—a sort of double jeopardy for our service men and women.<br><br>
We need to be particularly careful in what we propose. The fact is that Ministers will have a particularly difficult choice to make when considering what to propose in the next Armed Forces Bill. We, of course, support the continuation: it would be unthinkable that we should not, because wherever in the world they serve, our forces deserve a framework of justice in which they—and we—can have confidence.<br><br>
I echo the Minister's words in praise of our armed forces, but the military now face a starker choice than ever between being a reflection of society and a breed apart. That is a real and difficult choice for every soldier, sailor and airman and woman. For instance,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0388">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
the Secretary of State for Scotland, the right hon. Member for Hamilton, North and Bellshill (Dr. Reid), formerly the Minister for the Armed Forces, believed passionately that members of the forces should be a reflection of society at large. Some would say that that is a German concept and that he was talking of citizens in uniform. That contrasts sharply with the uncompromising views of others such as General Sir Michael Rose, who believe that the military can never be civilians in uniform but that they are a people apart, who operate to higher and different standards. The chiefs of staff will have to make harsh and difficult judgments, and politicians should tread with extreme caution.<br><br>
The forces will have to conform to civil law, except where a derogation is in place or if fighting or operational effectiveness has been impaired. But the forces also face the absolute need to recruit. That can lead to unrealistic demands for particular standards or a particular way of doing things that would not be acceptable to most young people. The forces will find a way to achieve that, as they always have in the past. However, they will need not only firm leadership but the help of the House in getting the balance right.<br><br>
I have made it my business to find out what the young men and women now going into the forces think. They have different attitudes, if not values, from those of my generation. They have a different approach to life, are more tolerant, probably more mature, are considerably less prejudiced, lead more complex lives and have always faced more and more difficult moral choices but are better able to handle them. I suspect that some of the deeper fears expressed by the phrase "falling standards", in society and in the forces, are unfounded.<br><br>
When the order was considered in another place, on 21 May, the Minister for Defence Procurement made an astonishing statement, which I would be grateful if the Minister for the Armed Forces could endorse—or deny—today, although he may not find it fair to have to respond in that way. He was asked by my noble Friend Lord Burnham if he could assure the House that discipline in the armed forces would in no way be affected by the Human rights Act 1998. The Minister replied
<br><blockquote><p>"I am now sure and can tell him that the position is unchanged since the last time we discussed these matters."</p></blockquote>
The substance of his argument was that there would be no change. He went on to say
<br><blockquote><p>"I have no concerns over these matters."</p></blockquote>
That is extraordinary. He said that the Ministry of Defence's plans for the next two years were under review—that is the best way of putting it—
<br><blockquote><p>"to ensure that we have all our existing summary discipline procedures in place and that they are all consummate with the requirements of the Human Rights Act."—[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 21 May 1999, Vol. 601, C. 267–8.]</p></blockquote>
I hope that that is found to be the case.<br><br>
I was astonished by the Minister's assertion because wherever I go commanding officers and others express extreme concern about the effect of the Human Rights Act on military discipline; they are much more worried about that than they are about, for example,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
homosexuality in the armed forces. Some people argue that article 3 of the European convention on human rights—which the Act implements—on the prohibition of inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, would cover the supposed exploitation of young recruits by being forced to carry heavy weights on their backs cross-country, for example, and that military personnel who sought to exercise their right to complain would be victimised. Under article 5, the right to liberty and security, no one is to be deprived of liberty save in several specific cases; that would strike at the heart of a commanding officer's power of summary discipline. He would no longer be able to detain a soldier or any other service man or woman.<br><br>
The right to a fair trail under article 6 has serious implications for the court martial system. On the face of it, that right and the right to the prohibition of discrimination, under article 14, would require the right of access to courts for military personnel to be no less favourable than for civilian personnel, unless the differences in treatment could be justified. There are huge grey areas such as, for example, article 8, which provides the right to respect for private and family life, home and correspondence. Members of the forces are currently forbidden from talking to the press. That prohibition could, under article 10 on freedom of expression, be construed as a deprivation of a human right. Article 14, on the prohibition of discrimination, would apply to the question of homosexuality in the armed forces. All those factors would have an impact on ordinary service life as we know it.<br><br>
Those are some of the Opposition's concerns about military discipline, which we shall undoubtedly address in the next Armed Forces Bill. In addition, Army Legal Services are dramatically under-resourced. In February 1998,I asked the then Minister for the Armed Forces how many qualified lawyers Army Legal Services employed in the United Kingdom, Germany and elsewhere. He answered that 41 qualified lawyers were employed as Army officers in the United Kingdom, 15 in Germany, and five elsewhere and that the establishment was expected to increase over the next year to approximately 70. That is quite inadequate for the volume of work now coming before the courts. In answers to parliamentary questions, I have received statistics about the number of cases being brought against the Ministry of Defence, and it is very substantial.<br><br>
The Army legal services branch of the Adjutant-General's Corps does an extremely fine job. I have visited Upavon twice in the past couple of years, and I know how hard the people work there. I hope that the Minister will accept this not as a criticism but as encouragement to ensure that the Army legal services are strengthened substantially as we face an ever-growing burden of legislation.<br><br>
My final point relates to the consolidation of the three service Acts. In the previous Parliament, I served on the Select Committee on Defence, which was extremely critical of the previous Administration. The Committee considering the most recent Armed Forces Bill, on which I also served, recommended in its special report
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0389">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"that the Government ensures that the necessary resources and Parliamentary time are made available to allow for the consolidation of Service law before the passage of the next Armed Forces Bill."</p></blockquote>
That means that we should expect consolidation to have taken place. However, in a memorandum from the Lord Chancellor's Department prepared on behalf of the Law Commission, we were told the most extraordinary story about how legislation is presented to the House. That memorandum, in annex C, on page 175 of "The Select Committee on the Armed Forces Bill", states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Substantial consolidation work can be undertaken only by some of the Parliamentary Counsel who are seconded to the Law Commission; and lengthy and complex consolidations may need to be handled by one of the senior draftsmen (of whom there may be only one seconded to the Commission at any one time). It is estimated that it would take a draftsman about two years to complete the consolidation of the three Service discipline Acts if he or she took it over now."</p></blockquote>
That was in 1996. It follows that the work could have been completed by now if it had been started in 1996. However, it was started much earlier. In the same memorandum, we are told:
<br><blockquote><p>"It has been a shortage of resources which has prevented the completion of the consolidation of the Service discipline Acts, rather than the priorities of the Law Commission … Work on the project was begun in July 1991 by a senior draftsman on secondment to the Commission and continued until the time when he returned to the Parliamentary Counsel Office in the summer of 1993. At that time work on the disciplinary provisions relating to the three Services was at an advanced stage."</p></blockquote>
We were then told:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Law Commission understands that, unfortunately … demands on his time generated by current Bills have been such that the time needed to complete the armed forces consolidations never materialises."</p></blockquote>
It goes on to say that
<br><blockquote><p>"the current proposals relating to courts-martial"</p></blockquote>
—that is, in the previous Bill—
<br><blockquote><p>"would make such substantial changes to the original legislation that consolidation in advance would be wholly inappropriate."</p></blockquote>
They started in 1991, realised that it was too much work, and subsequently realised that it was "wholly inappropriate" even to try. That is unacceptable for service men and women. Members of our armed forces are in the Balkans with their lives on the line, and we do not have the resources to provide the proper legal framework in which to revise the military law on which they may ultimately depend for their life and safety. I hope that the Minister will put that right. I asked some questions that probed the Lord Chancellor's Department. I hoped that I would have received the answers before the Committee met as they were due at 3.30 pm, but had not arrived by 4.28 pm. I stress that my criticism is not of the Minister but of the system in our country as it relates to the three service discipline Acts.<br><br>
Given those few remarks flagging up some problems and suggesting subjects to which we will have to return, I repeat the Opposition's support for the continuation of the order.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
<p>4.50 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Joan Walley <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: In giving my welcome to my hon. Friend the Minister's statement I have no wish to detain the Committee unnecessarily, as I am sure that it will be pleased to hear. However, I want to highlight a specific issue that has concerned me during my 12 years in this place. I am concerned about discipline and the way in which the armed forces deal with individuals forced, perhaps because of bullying, to go absent without leave.<br><br>
My right hon. and noble Friend Lord Ashley of Stoke and I had considerable cause under the previous Government to be concerned about bullying. I feel strongly that, when we review future disciplinary procedures and scrutinise the extension of existing proposals, we should make sure that we are sensitive to the bullying that has, unfortunately, occurred in our armed forces. I speak as someone who has spent time with the armed forces parliamentary scheme, and who has a great deal of regard for the work of all members of our armed forces.</span></p>
<p>4.52 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mike Hancock <span class='memberconstituency'>(Portsmouth, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I say, Dr. Clark, how nice it is to have you chairing the Committee? It would be churlish of me not to follow the example of the Minister and the hon. Member for Salisbury (Mr. Key) in welcoming you.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Salisbury's final point, which I support, was the consolidation of the level playing field for all three armed services. I reread with great interest the record of the Defence Committee that served in the previous Parliament. Its clearly stated objective of unification and consolidation is long overdue and I cannot believe that there is now a reasonable argument for not proceeding with it. There are good reasons why we should do so, and I cannot believe for the life of me that it will take a great deal of parliamentary time to achieve it. I would genuinely like some explanation about whether it will happen, and if not why the Minister believes that it is not possible.<br><br>
I also support the hon. Member for Salisbury's line on legal services, not only in relation to the Army but to the way in which legal services are provided to service men and to the forces. Representing an area such as Portsmouth and living there all my life, except when I have worked away, I have read with great interest of the courts martial that have occurred; the notoriously public ones that have featured long and hard in the tabloid press and the not so nationally renowned cases. I remember an old boxing colleague of mine, known as "Flogger Phil", who was court-martialled in the Navy. He was reprimanded during a court martial for looking under the table. When the court martial president asked him what he was looking for, he said that he was looking for justice under the table because none was coming over it. That is an old joke but a true one, and I am glad that the Minister can smile at it. Flogger Phil built a reputation out of that saying, in and out of detention barracks.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0390">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
Service men and women, especially those who have problems, say that sometimes proceedings are dragged out for long periods—years, in some instances—from initial arrest to facing charges or to charges finally being dropped. Service careers have been ruined in the time that it takes. Such delays damage not only an individual's service career but their family structure and the morale of those who work with them. There is a need to come to terms with the representation that is available and the time that it takes to deal with proceedings within the armed forces, and the length of time must be addressed seriously.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Salisbury spoke about the breed apart, but I do not share that line. I do not know whether he supports General Rose's view that the men and women in our armed forces are a breed apart, or whether he supports the view of the citizen service person expressed by the former Minister for the Armed Forces, now the Secretary of State for Scotland. I support the latter view.<br><br>
Tens of thousands of service personnel live in and around my constituency, as do 16,000 naval personnel and their families. Many thousands of Army and Air Force personnel are stationed in the area. I know that many of them would not like us to think that they are a breed apart; they believe that they have chosen to do a particular job on behalf of the nation. They do not believe that that gives them any special privileges; it proves that they are committed to the nation. They expect the same sort of justice that the rest of us experience in civilian life. That is why I am sorry that the Government have not proposed changing the regulations on sexual orientation that affect service men and women.<br><br>
It is patently obvious to most reasonable people—this touches on the point about human rights made by the hon. Member for Salisbury—that it cannot be right in this day and age that men and women, especially those in Government service, can be pilloried, bullied, pushed and finally kicked out of the service of the nation. We would not accept that in any other employment measure. Men and women who have proven loyal service over many years—sometimes close on 20 years—have been pushed out of the service of the nation at great personal cost to themselves and their families and loved ones.<br><br>
It cannot be right and proper that, two years into this Government's term of office, they still have not introduced proposals to make a fundamental change and give equal rights to men and women who choose to serve the nation, as opposed to those of us who choose not to do so. I am sure that we would all be bitter if a sexual orientation measure prohibited men and women serving in Parliament, yet we are prepared not to take action to change the regulations that affect those men and women who choose to serve the nation but do no share the same rights as the rest of us.<br><br>
I hope that by the end of this Parliament we will have come to terms with the issue and that there will have been some fresh thinking and a recognition that many people, whatever their sexual orientation, want to serve the nation in the armed forces and that they want to be seen as proud members of armed forces.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
I share the views of those hon. Members who have worked closely with the armed forces over many years and have learned to love, respect and admire their dedication to duty. I have not met anyone who, because of his or her sexual orientation, was any less of a sailor, soldier, Wren or member of the Royal Air Force. We, as a nation, poorly judge those people and do a gross disservice to them. I hope that we will have a sensible, constructive dialogue and move towards that change.<br><br>
Members of the Defence committee and I have had first hand experience of being deployed with 1,000 Royal Marines, many of whom—officers, non-commissioned officers and enlisted men—made known to use their strongly held feelings, both for and against the argument. I understand the concerns that those in the armed forces have about the issue, and I understand and accept that differences in the House, but most men and women believe that human rights should be applied under the law to everyone, irrespective of our chosen line of work. I hope that there will be a breakthrough in that direction.<br><br>
In my advice centres, I see—unfortunately on a more than weekly basis—the effect of overstretch on discipline and the morale of the family, as well as the downside on the service personnel who are on long deployments. Overstretch is a continued pressure on service men and it leads in some instances to a breakdown in their normal firm discipline. Mistakes are then made, whether it is a bar fight in Cyprus or a problem with men and women serving at sea.<br><br>
Lots of these issues are about pressure on our service men and women. Much of it is needless pressure that is created by improper provision and a lack of resources. We need to see a significant improvement. I would not like to think that we have seen no improvement in the past two years, but the figures prove that there is a worsening of morale and discipline. Disciplinary problems have been genuinely attributed to the pressures that individuals have been put under because of more being demanded of them in difficult circumstances.<br><br>
I hope that the Committee will agree the recommendations. Enough has been said by the hon. Member for Salisbury and me, as well as by the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Ms Walley), to sow some seeds in the Minister's mind for the next time we consider this matter, and more importantly, to pursue an Armed Forces Bill, in which many of these points could be incorporated.<br><br>
When I walk around the streets of Portsmouth, I see far fewer problems associated with service discipline today than I did as a youngster growing up there. That may be attributed to the fact that all service personnel used to have to go ashore in uniform, so the problems were more obvious to spot. However, I know from the pubs and clubs in my city and the rest of Hampshire, including Aldershot, that nobody would suggest that the young people in our armed forces today are any less committed than their forebears, or any more of a problem to the community—I believe that they are less of a problem—than they were 30 or 40 years ago.<br><br>

There is a problem within the services; bullying is a classic example. Whether we like it or not, young soldiers, sailors and airmen are bullied for one reason or another. Contrary to what most people think, young officers go through similar systematic abuse, which some of them cannot and do not take. We lose good people because of it. The continuing problem of bullying in our armed forces, at many different levels, is a problem that we must tackle. We will not get large numbers from the ethnic community joining the armed forces while there are well publicised cases of enthnic groups being deliberately intimidated within the armed forces. A substantial number of young people are put off because of bullying generally.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will accept what I have said in the spirit in which it was intended, which was meant to be helpful. We have little alternative but to agree the order today, but I hope that we shall have an opportunity in the very near future to debate some of these issues in depth.</span></p>
<p>5.4 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor <span class='memberconstituency'>(Solihull)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I have ever intervened on the matter of the death penalty either in Committee or on the Floor of the House, but I want to do so briefly this afternoon. As I have given the Minister no notice of a question that I admit comes from an unusual angle—indeed, I only thought of it during his remarks about the death penalty—I should be happy if he were to respond by letter to the points that I am about to make. I am sure that it would be regarded as an extended courtesy if, when doing so, he wrote also to you, Dr. Clark, and to other members of the Committee.<br><br>
I was born in 1941, so I belong to the category of people who were notified in the 1950s that they would not have to undertake national service. I am a member of the oldest age group that did not do national service. I have never been a soldier, a sailor or an airman and my questions are those of a layman—and a representative of taxpayers in my constituency.<br><br>
If the Minister were to tell the Committee that the death penalty could be used in the armed services in peacetime, I would be very surprised. I cannot think what action by a member of the armed forces in peacetime would merit that punishment. The death penalty was available for treason and arson in a naval dockyard, but I am not sure whether such provisions are still on the statute book. Indeed, I very much doubt that they would be enforced even if they were.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hancock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Portsmouth, South (Mr. Hancock) said that such provisions are no longer on the statute book, so it seems that my assumption was right.<br><br>
What is the position in active service in wartime? Let us suppose that there was a severe act of treachery or of assistance to the enemy when in action in the field. If that happened on board ship, it would be possible to take the man below deck and lock him up. It would not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
even be necessary to lose the active service of a member of the ship's crew to stand guard over the locked cabin door. On a ship, it would probably be the modern equivalent of, "Clap him in irons".<br><br>
However, there are no custodial facilities on the move in the field. My next question is not intended to be deliberately dramatic, but surely the answer to an act of severe treachery or assistance to the enemy in the field must be summary execution. If a commanding officer took it into his own hands to respond with such punishment, would not that be a lawful act? The record may read something different from that after the event, but surely there is only one response that the commanding officer can take, having the responsibility for the safety of the rest of his service men and women, and there being one person in the midst who is part of the danger and no custodial resources. It is brutal; it is unattractive, but there is only one answer to my question. It is a tricky and serious subject. I would not blame the Minister if he took time to reflect on my question, but I should like to know whether such a response by a commander would be lawful.</span></p>
<p>5.9 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Doug Henderson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal first with the single issues that have been raised by members of the Committee, after which I shall deal with those that have been raised in common. In response to the hon. Member for Solihull, there is no death penalty for treason or arson in a naval dockyard in peacetime. We must distinguish between summary execution in the field, and the death penalty that has been applied after a trial. I shall reflect on the hon. Gentleman's question and write to him. Indeed, I shall be happy to do so; it would be better if I took legal advice, although I know how hard-pressed our lawyers are.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister take it from me that the response that he has given is all that I ask for.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Henderson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful that the hon. Gentleman accepts what I propose.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North asked about bullying. I make it absolutely clear that the current service discipline Acts enable the service chiefs to take whatever action necessary to root out bullying wherever they find it. The Government take an extremely dim view of bullying being tolerated. Firm guidelines have been given to the chiefs of staff, although they do not need them because they take the same view. They know that it is damaging to morale and operational effectiveness. They also know that, if tales get back to recruiting areas of the lack of fair treatment in our services, it can deter recruitment. Tackling bullying is a priority, but we already have sufficient powers to do what is needed.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Portsmouth, South (Mr. Hancock) asked about sexual orientation. Parliament will have the opportunity to consider that matter during the passage of the next armed forces Bill. The hon. Gentleman referred to the Select Committee procedure, which is one opportunity for Parliament to consider the implications. However, Parliament will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1998-1999V008P0I0392">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
have other opportunities to express a view during the passage of the Bill. The Government will further consider the matter in the light of Parliament's deliberations.<br><br>
Other questions were asked by the hon. Members for Salisbury and for Portsmouth, South. I thank both hon. Gentlemen for their support for the continuation order. The consolidation of the existing service Acts will not change anything, but it will bring the legal basis for action into one documentation system. That will be separate from considering the need for greater consistency among the three services in dealing with disciplinary matters. The Government give that review priority, too. It will be dealt with as part of the strategic defence review: I and my Department officials have already given some attention to the matter and we are still working on it.<br><br>
That review is extremely complicated and it needs much consultation, not only with those involved but also with the wider community, which will be a separate process. Those two processes will continue at different speeds. The second process involves social-value judgments, political-value judgments, and operational considerations. The first process, the consolidation of the existing legal basis, is essentially a technical matter; it is complicated but we are pursuing it.<br><br>
Once those matters are completed at a technical level, we shall still require parliamentary time to bring about the consolidation. However, our bid for parliamentary time has to be put in a pot and judged against other bids for parliamentary time—within our Department and beyond it. We are proceeding with the work and, at the first opportunity, we shall bring our proposals to Parliament.<br><br>
On the question of tri-service, as I have said, we are continuing with that work, but further consideration has to be given on the matter, and I cannot say when I might be able to bring proposals to the House. However, we are committed to doing so.<br><br>
I have learned that many legal matters arise when dealing with the armed forces, and our lawyers are extremely busy. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Portsmouth, South for all the questions he asks. Our lawyers have to scrutinise all the answers and the hon. Gentleman gives them plenty of work. They are always grateful to be able to enlighten him.<br><br>
Our lawyers have a heavy agenda and I am responsible for ensuring that the necessary legal backing is in place to deal with the various issues that arise, whether scrutinising legislation, advising Ministers and chiefs of staff on operational matters or
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
dealing with court or individual cases. That is a heavy, time-consuming business. We do not rely totally on internal legal resources but often employ external resources, whether solicitors or counsel, on issues where a specific expertise is not held within the Department but is better provided from outside. I am grateful for the support of the Committee—particularly should there be any conflict with my dear friends in the Treasury over any submissions that we make.<br><br>
The final point raised by the hon. Member for Salisbury was that of the Human Rights Act 1998—another piece of legislation that involved onerous legal scrutiny by the Department. That Act does not introduce any new rights; it gives greater access to rights that already exist under the European convention on human rights. The Act puts greater pressure on society to change legislation that is found to be in contravention of the requirements of the convention. There will therefore be much more work, not only in our Department but in all Departments, to ensure that new legislation is consistent with the requirements of the convention, as incorporated in the Human Rights Act, and to examine existing legislation to ensure that it too is consistent with it. Where it is not consistent, great pressure will be brought to bear to bring it into line.<br><br>
I am currently undertaking that exercise and examining the Human Rights Act in detail, particularly the area of discipline, to consider the implications for the legal base of the Ministry of Defence. I hope to make some form of statement to Parliament on those matters in the not too distant future, but that is dependent on several factors, some of which are outside my control—such as how quickly the Department receives advice on specific questions that have been raised. I hope that that puts at rest the fears of the hon. Member for Salisbury.<br><br>
I do not think that any other specific questions were raised; if I have missed any, I would be happy to follow the commitment that I gave the hon. Member for Solihull. I will also willingly write to hon. Members should they think of questions that they did not ask today and which they think are germane. I am confident that they will submit questions to me for reply. I commend the order to the Committee.</span></p>
