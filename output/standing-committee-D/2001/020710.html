	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Health (Jacqui Smith)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><q><p>That the Committee has considered the Local Government Finance (England) Special Grant Report (No. 102) (HC 943), on Children's Services (Quality Protects) Special Grants for 2001–02 and 2002–03.</p></q>
I am pleased today to have the opportunity to debate this special grant report—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Yes, I really am. The Government are committed to high-quality and well resourced services for vulnerable children so that they have the best possible life chances. The quality protects programme sets out clear objectives for children's services and has been a central plank in the wider strategy to tackle social exclusion. It focuses on the most vulnerable and disadvantaged children in our society—those looked after by local authorities, those in the child protection system, and other children in need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The children's special grant, which supports the quality protects programme, has grown from £75 million when the programme was launched in 1999–2000 to £230 million this year. The grant has also been supplemented by transfers from other Departments so that the total grant to support quality protects will be £462 million this year. That includes money for implementing the Children (Leaving Care) Act 2000. However, that money is being paid under section 93 of the Local Government Act 2000, rather than this special grant report, and so is not the subject of today's discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The allocations to local authorities of their share of this grant were announced in December. I know that hon. Members, particularly the hon. Member for Cheadle (Mrs. Calton), will be interested in the allocation method. The allocation was as follows: 50 per cent. on the basis of the 1998–99 standard spending assessment formula for children's social services and 50 per cent. on the current formula. That formula has been in use since the start of quality protects in 1999–2000 and has proved—I hope that I do not come to regret this—uncontroversial. We will, of course, be looking at the formula for 2003–04 in the light of changes to the SSA system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
Assuming that today's report is agreed, money will go out to authorities for the first quarter of this financial year in the next few weeks. As there are at least seven of us here today who were at the equivalent grant report debate last year it is worth noting that I apologised to the Committee for having brought forward the grant report in December and I promised that I would do better this year. We have done significantly better. The hard work of officials in the Department deserves praise. I know that the report will be welcomed by local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What has been achieved and where will we expect to see progress in respect of the payment of this grant? First, we have seen more and better corporate working across councils. We have seen more partnership working with voluntary organisations. Young people leaving care have been getting better support as a result of the Children (Leaving Care) Act 2000, which was implemented in October 2001. Moreover, the percentage of those leaving care who were aged 18 or over has risen dramatically from 33 per cent. in 1998–99 to 46 per cent. in 2000–01.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a decrease in the number of placements experienced by children in care. We all understand the importance of stability for children who will already have had considerable instability in their lives. Only 16 per cent. of children now experience three or more placements in one year; 20 per cent. did so in 1997–98. More councils are listening to children and young people in their care; more councillors are asking the all-important question, "Would this be good enough for my child?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have established a national young people's reference group to inform the policy and such groups influence policy throughout the country. There have been improvements in the collection and use of management information. This year, as last year, £15 million of grant is earmarked for services for disabled children and their families. That focus, and investment, has already led to a lot of good, innovative work. More family support services are being provided, particularly home-based respite care and sitting services. Every authority gave examples of additional services being provided to enable disabled children to undertake sport and arts activities. Our commitment is clear: in 2003–04, the amount of money earmarked for disabled children will rise from £15 million to £30 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also making progress in the education of children in care. That is crucial; if our own children need the life chances and choices that educational achievement provides, looked-after children need them even more. Care leavers too often continue to be significantly over-represented among the homeless and in the prison populations, which remains a great concern to the Government. Care leavers do not achieve the educational outcome that we would want for them. However, joint guidance was issued by the Department of Health and the Department for Education and Skills to local councils in May 2000, and it has been backed up by implementation work setting down practical measures for schools and those responsible for care to take to improve the education of children in the looked-after system. As a result,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0095">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
there has been some improvement: the latest attainment data for the year ending 31 March 2001 shows that 37 per cent. of care leavers aged 16 plus achieved one or more GCSEs and GNVQs, up from 30 per cent. the previous year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the attainment gap between looked-after children and their peers is still too wide. That is why the social exclusion unit was asked to conduct a study, looking at how the attainment of looked-after children can be raised further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This year, there is a new capital element to the children's services grants, specifically designed to increase access to information technology for looked-after children and care leavers. Increasing numbers of children have access to computers at home to help them with their homework and to develop the IT skills that are so important for modern life. The new grant of £9.5 million this year and next will help to ensure that looked-after children are not left behind in this important respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Through the quality protects programme, we continue to identify areas for action, such as placement choice. Although our statistics show that placement stability is improving, councils still struggle to meet children's needs, with insufficient foster carers and insufficient specialist support to help when placements are at risk. Early this year, therefore, we embarked on a major review of placement choice and fostering services called choice protects. The review is focusing on helping councils to improve commissioning and to deliver effective placements and services for their looked-after children, with a special emphasis on fostering services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The review is also looking closely at the issues that put pressure on foster carers, at the support, training and reward of those carers, at the contribution of independent foster agencies, at the role of care by family and friends, and at the effectiveness and need for various types of therapeutic provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report also covers the payment to authorities for regional development workers; 8.5 full-time equivalent experienced social services managers have been appointed to drive forward progress in the quality protects programme, working with individual authorities, developing training and sharing good practice. The payment to authorities for their services is included in this report. Last year, we had some discussion about planning and management action plans. This year, we have continued to ask authorities to submit their quality protects management action plans to the Department of Health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The MAPs set out councils' plans to address the quality protects objectives. The MAPs were evaluated and, if they were found wanting, they were resubmitted after discussions with the social services inspectorate. Subsequently, all 150 MAPs were approved. As we near the end of the quality protects programme—it ends in March 2004—we have begun the mainstreaming process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The MAPs that councils submitted in January will be the last that they send to the Department. Although MAPs have been a catalyst for improved planning at a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
local level—it is important that local planning on a multi-agency basis and the involvement of children and young people continue—as part of our drive both to embed quality protects into mainstream practice and to reduce centrally imposed planning requirements on councils, we will not require the submission of MAPs in relation to next year's allocations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, I am pleased to bring forward the special grant report in order to enable local authorities to go forward in developing the important work that the quality protects programme has enabled them to do for some of the most vulnerable children in our communities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Tim Loughton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Worthing and Shoreham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We welcome money to provide extra support for children's services, on which the special grant report concentrates. The recent survey of directors of social services up and down the country conducted by the Association of Directors of Social Services found that 69 per cent. of the £1 billion shortfall in social services funding from which departments in local authorities say that they are suffering is in children's services. Although all the headlines and many of the debates that we have had in the House have been about the pressure on services for the elderly such as care homes, not enough attention is paid to the pressure on children's services, which are often robbed to pay for shortcomings in care for the elderly. Many aspects of the special grant report are therefore welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I particularly welcome both the additional money that is being concentrated on services for the disabled and the Minister's point about providing £9.5 million to provide technology at homes for looked-after children. Hon. Members who have been round schools in their constituencies or elsewhere will be well aware of the gap that is opening up in educational attainment between children who have access to computers not only in school but at home and those who do not. Technology is such an important tool, and it is absolutely right that children in the care of local authorities and children who are looked after by other organisations should have equal access to it to give them a fair start in life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, the Minister has referred to quality protects many times in the past, and each time she mentions it the amount of money seems to double. It is only right that we should draw attention to and ask questions about the details of the report rather than taking headline figures at face value. As with the last special grant report on which she and I met, will she comment on the influence of the new star rating system for social services on the calculations that have been made as part of the special grant report? Has there been bias in the figures apart from in the calculations for the previous and current standing spending assessments?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask the Minister specifically about provisions that may have been built into the grants to deal with asylum-seeking children. In 1996, 631 unaccompanied children applied for the asylum in the UK. In the last year, that figure has risen tenfold to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0096">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
6,000 of whom 1,400, who mostly entered through the port of Dover, applied in Kent alone. An awful lot of them were also in my own county, West Sussex, coming in through Gatwick airport. They have given much additional work to West Sussex social services, which I must say has coped with that exceedingly well and been commended by some of the Minister's inspectors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the allocation of funds to local authorities, do the criteria take any account of the pressures on certain authorities from asylum seeking children who, obviously, often need specialist care and help? In my local authority, we have had a problem with unaccompanied girls arriving from west Africa, particularly Nigeria and Sierra Leone, who, after being taken into care by social services, have then ended up in prostitution in northern Italy, as part of a child-trafficking ring. The needs of those children have brought some £1 million additional expense to West Sussex.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures show that West Sussex fairs averagely well, with a total children's services grant of £1.486 million compared with Kent, which has the very special problems that we have mentioned, and which has a £3.193 million budget. Many local authorities that do not have the entry points that I have mentioned receive varying amounts, such as Essex, which received £2.7 million, Hampshire, which received £2.3 million, Lancashire, which received £2.9 million and Norfolk, which received £1.5 million. Can the Minister comment on what provisions have been made for services for asylum seeking children in particular?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the way in which the SSA allocation is made, the London boroughs of Newham and Haringey, for example, have been awarded substantial grants because they are classified as outer-London boroughs. However, in being defined as outer-London boroughs, they miss out in the SSA allocation, despite their considerable inner-city social problems. Can the Minister comment on what compensations have been made through the grants for that situation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On joined-up action with other schemes, can the Minister tell us how the quality protects programme interacts with other child-based schemes and initiatives such as the sure start programme? Is there an overlapping of work or funding between different schemes with the same objective? It has often been observed that a plethora of "regeneration schemes" frequently overlap and compete for the same resources and local personnel. Can she assure us that there is not repetition in the work that the grants are funding?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the management action plans to which the Minister referred, were there any authorities that were initially refused approval by the Secretary of State for their MAPs—for the progress and implementation of their previous plans and for future MAPs—which had to resubmit to receive funding for this year? Can she comment on how well the MAPs that are now coming to an end were received previously?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
Can the Minister elaborate a little on how the regional development worker grants are working? Of the special grant of £120 million for 2000–01, I can calculate that £730,000 has been set aside to meet the cost of the equivalent of eight full-time regional development workers and their assistants to work in partnership with local authorities and colleagues in the regional social services inspectorate to deliver the programme of change. Can she tell us how many regional development workers are currently employed, what plans she has to increase that number further, and the likely cost of that? Touching on the relationship with the adoption and performance taskforce, can the Minister comment on the role of regional development workers in connection with that taskforce?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recent media reports, which I think are well-founded, and various missives from the Department responsible, stated that the Government are planning to reform the current SSA formula substantially. Consultation is taking place on that plan, which will see a number of councils likely to lose out financially, not least those in the south. How will that impact on local councils and their plans to implement children's services after the end of quality protects?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On that score, can the Minister say at this stage what will happen after the quality protects programme ends in 2004? It was, quite rightly, extended from three to five years, but the events that quality protects is there to fund are not one-offs, but part of an ongoing, long-term process. Perhaps the Minister will explain what will happen after 2004 if local authorities do not reach the 11 key objectives that they are tasked to reach as part of the quality protects scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is as aware as I am, from my service on the Special Standing Committee that considered the Adoption and Children Bill, that the number of looked-after children has increased by around 17 per cent. during the past four years and stands at around 58,000. Can she give an indication of trends during the current year and whether the number of looked-after children is falling or increasing at the same rate, in which case the money will have to be spread among a much greater constituency of young people?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to touch on the subject of social workers coming into the profession. The Government are committed to increasing the number of people applying for social work training by 2004 by around 5,000. Can the Minister assure us that the quality and professionalism that is needed in dealing with sensitive cases is not being compromised to meet those targets? I gather that the figures to 2001 show a small rise in the number of students studying social work at university and in higher education from 13,400 to 13,700. Can she tell us the current intake figures and the number of students who are, more importantly, going into social work training and becoming key social workers, particularly in child support services and child care, which have the biggest gaps of all social services departments?

As usual, I have given the Minister quite a long list of detailed questions, but I am sure that she will have no problem dealing with them in her response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Patsy Calton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cheadle)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, have a few questions to ask the Minister. For those who have not been here on previous occasions, may I say that I have been a chair of social services? The quality protects grant has been an important part of the funding of social care during the past few years. Its purpose is to improve the management and delivery of services to children. I am pleased that the Government are focusing on this important area and are determined to bring about change in the quality of services provided to young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Minister for her recognition in advance of my concern about transparency. It is important that we know how the money is allocated. The total sum awarded to local authorities appear to be skewed when comparing like with like and I believe that the Government should act to demonstrate their commitment to fair distribution that meets need. I emphasise that because most of us recognise that when standard spending assessments are used to achieve the distribution, they do not always reflect need. Considerable work has been done in Stockport, where I was chair of social services. It was clear that the relative affluence of the borough did not in any way predict the level of need for children needing the services of the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should feel considerably happier if the methodology by which the grants are allocated were tabled simultaneously with the report. I recognise that the Government are acting within the terms of section 88B(3)(c) of the Local Government Finance Act 1988, which was amended by the Local Government Finance Act 1992, but the matter is not as transparent as it should be. If we were dealing with small sums it would not matter so much, but £1.3 billion was allocated via ring-fenced grants in personal social services alone last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased to see that information technology for looked-after children features, and that section 24(1) of the Children Act 1989 extended assistance to 16 to 21-year-olds who have been in the care of a local authority. That is my interpretation. I am assuming that a young person who is still at university or some sort of higher education after their 21st birthday will not have their computer removed. I would be particularly concerned about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that we have already had the answer to my next question. I was going to ask if the amounts indicated for capital expenditure on IT in annexe A have any relationship to need. Obviously, if they have been calculated on the basis of SSA, we have already discussed that. It would be possible for local authorities to say precisely how many bits of kit they needed to meet the needs in children's homes, or foster homes—if provisions extend that far. Some local authorities have already been able to provide computer equipment for those categories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What assessment has the Minister made of satisfactory process with the MAPs, and were any local authorities penalised by refusal of grant, or part of grant? The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton) has already focused on
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
that area. Has the money already been paid for the current year? I acknowledge what the Minister said: we have come to the matter sooner than we did last year. However, that does not alter the fact that we are still several months into the financial year. I think that it rather undermines the work of Parliament if we are given information after the event, rather than at least at the same time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If local authorities know that the money is coming, or it is already there, they may simply spend the sums that they would have spent on other things. The Government can ensure that the money is spent on what they want, but that does not alter the fact that it may be a temptation to local authorities simply to move things along, if they know that the money is coming anyway. Is the Minister not worried that the effect of the grants is centralising? They effectively take away control and responsibility for bringing about change from elected members of local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the quality protects regional development worker grant, I am absolutely in favour of spreading good practice—	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must ask hon. Members to be quiet when someone is addressing the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Calton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hood. How were the seven councils selected for annexe D(3)(a)? New section 88B(3) in schedule 10(18) to the Local Government Finance Act 1992, which amends the 1988 Act, clearly states:
	<br><q><p>"where the Secretary of State proposes to make two or more special grants to different authorities he shall, before making the grants, make a determination stating with respect to the grants—</p></q>
	<br><q><p>(a) to which authorities they are to be paid".</p></q>
Annexe D(3)(b) states:
	<br><q><p>"any other authority which incurs relevant expenditure during the relevant period".</p></q>
There is no identification there. I wonder whether it is lawful not to specify which authority is the "any other authority", particularly part of the way through the year when presumably part of the money has already been spent. What guidelines have been given for maximum expenditure, and has the Treasury agreed to any maximum sums?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.58 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Wilshire 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Spelthorne)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Hood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support in principle the objectives that the Government have set. I would be churlish not to welcome an injection of money into these services. The children whom we are talking about are among the most vulnerable people in our society and it is quite right that we should give as much attention and help as we possibly can to all children, especially to those with particular needs. I support the report in principle, but I have to say that I am worried about some of the detail, and I should be grateful if the Minister responded to my questions and put my mind at rest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My first worry is methodology. A few days ago, I said in one of the Committee Rooms that I had heard mention of the dreaded initials SSA. The moment I hear the term SSA, I worry about the methodology
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0098">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
used to do any calculation. When, later. I address the annexes to the report, I shall explain my apprehensions in greater detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My concern over methodology and the effect of SSA leads me to worry about the fairness of the exercise. Although I have no difficulty with the principles, I do have a difficulty with any distribution of money that is unfair to some parts of the country. I make no apology for highlighting again the effects of the reports on my county, Surrey, where other people are convinced there are no problems and little deprivation; I have been told before that we have enough money of our own, so we do not need help from the Government. However, things are not quite like that, and we need to explore the idea of fairness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another worry is the timetable to which the Government are working. As the hon. Member for Cheadle pointed out, we have already started this financial year—in fact, we are a quarter of the way through it. However, only now is Parliament being asked to authorise the exact details of the report. If I set off on my domestic budgeting for the year and got a quarter of the way through without knowing my income, I might get into problems, and certainly my bank manager would be on the phone to ask what was going on. Why does a local authority have to get a quarter of the way through the year before it knows for certain what it will receive?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are probably two explanations for that delay. One is that there is incompetence in the Government and they simply cannot organise things in time, so any old time will do. That is the more charitable of the two explanations. The other relates to the development of the principle of total contempt for Parliament. Any time will do, because there is never any possibility of proper debate. However much scrutiny Parliament can provide, the thumping great Labour majority will ensure that a mindless, unthinking strategy will be rolled out to rubber-stamp what the Government have decided. That is the less charitable explanation. Perhaps the Minister can say whether the reason for delay is incompetence or a much more sinister contempt for Parliament; it must be one or the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of split responsibilities also worries me. That general issue has been highlighted by the way in which the Minister introduced the special grant. She explained how much money we started with in 1999—I believe that it was £75 million—and said that it had grown to £230 million. She then said that the figure is not really £230 million, but is actually double that if one includes the contributions from other services, and other parts of local government and central Government. She said that the money available for the work that we are discussing is therefore growing to £462 million. Here we have the Department of Health taking the lead on an initiative that we all support in principle; it says that it is being active. However, we then discover that that is not what is happening at all; if the Minister's figures are correct, and if I understand them correctly, we are considering only half of that figure for investment, because the other half is coming from somewhere else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
That is a splendid example of split responsibilities. I have said it before, and I will say it now and in the future: we need to examine how we co-ordinate services. We should not deliver packages of care to particular groups of people—in this case, the more vulnerable children in our society—on a split basis. We should put together an agency effort, so that all the money is channelled through one source. If that means upsetting Departments' arrangements or treading on the toes of certain people in local government, so be it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that half the money would come from one grant and half from another, which shows that bureaucracy and service providers matter more than the people who receive the service. Those people would get better value for money and more attention if the care was not split up. It is all very well to say, as the Minister does in the document, that the Secretary of State will monitor what is happening and has powers to take away and to require. I support that, because it has to be done somehow, but that is only half the activity required. Someone else must monitor the other half and take away, if necessary. The proposed set-up cannot be sensible. If a local authority is failing under the terms of the special grant, we can be certain that its services are failing elsewhere. Responsibility for any intervention should not be split. One Government inspectorate or independent body should be able to look in from the outside and encompass the entire investment in this very desirable service, not just the half that we are considering this afternoon. Those are my concerns about a measure with which, in general, I agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are told that
	<br><q><p>"(2) Amounts payable to authorities"</p></q>
are to be determined by SSA. Will the Minister tell us which children's indicators under the SSA are being used? Will she tell us what else is being used? The last time I had this discussion with the Minister, we were talking about special grants to the elderly. On that occasion, the distribution formula under the SSA was calculated on the basis of some figures and star ratings in relation to the elderly, which is right. However, to a certain extent it also took into account SSA and star-rating considerations for children's services. The way in which local authorities received money for the elderly therefore depended on how they dealt with children. If that is so, I fear that the Minister may tell us that the reverse is now true, and that consideration is given not only to certain parts of the SSA formula that relate directly to children, but to parts that overlap. It would be useful if the Minister could tell us which parts are relevant, rather than referring generally to the part of the SSA that relates to children. The SSA has many parts, only some of which are relevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jacqui Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can shorten my response to the hon. Gentleman's questions by clarifying the fact that the personal social services SSA does not include a series of children's sections. The SSA includes four blocks: children, other adults, and two blocks related to older people. The allocation under consideration is calculated solely on the basis of the children's block.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0099">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilshire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is helpful, and addresses one worry; the SSA focuses totally on children. However, it also raises the question why, on previous occasions, we could not exclude the children's block from consideration of the elderly. The Minister may exclude everyone but children on this occasion, but when I suggested the other day that others should be excluded from the calculation for the elderly, the answer was that that could not be done. I find that riveting. It can be done on Mondays, Wednesdays and Friday, but not on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. Today happens to be a Wednesday, but what the Minister will say when we discuss these matters again under the next statutory instrument, I do not know. She will probably say again that we cannot do it. That is inconsistency of the highest order. It is not good enough simply to say, "Oh, those are the children's figures."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For my sins, I served quite a long sentence in local government, and it was my misfortune to have to try to understand local government finance and to be involved in the discussions that introduced the SSA. We went round the course of saying that the previous system of block grants was unfair, unreasonable and unwieldy, and what happened? The new and simpler SSA system was introduced. The formula had fewer parts, and people thought that it would be fine, but now there are again many parts to it. I shall touch on those that relate to children in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it enthralling that the SSA is to be replaced. We are consulting about that. My hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham raised the matter, and I shall be interested to hear the Minister's answer. What representations will she make about the children's element of the grant and how it will be calculated? It is amazing and amusing that we got rid of the old system and introduced the SSA because it would be simpler, but it has now become so complicated in its turn that we shall have to replace it with something simpler. I have heard all that before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The moral of the story is that when we go simple, we go rough and ready, and unfair. Bit by bit, as more complications are added to the formula, it becomes fairer in most people's view. That is why it is not possible to get away with the comment, "Oh, children are a separate block." We should be considering how the children's block is calculated. What allowances are made for deprivation? We are focusing on the most deprived children in our community, and rightly so, but we must be clear about how we arrive at knowing who the deprived children are and how many there are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I mentioned in my introduction, there is a great temptation to say that Surrey, almost by definition, is not as deprived as other places. That might be true in some respects, but it is not true in others. One of the strangest statistics in some people's minds is that Surrey is one of the local authorities with the highest percentage of children who have special needs and are statemented. One would not expect that, but that is how it is. The levels of deprivation among children are not quite as simple as those for the elderly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jacqui Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot resist this. For the second time, the hon. Gentleman has suggested that special
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
educational needs correlate with deprivation. Does he accept that that is not the case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilshire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what I am asking the Minister about. What indicators are being used? If we were debating the health of the elderly, the ages at which people die and the diseases that they die of would be good indicators, but in the case of children, is it the number of children who are abused, the number at risk, the number without parents or what? That is what we need to know. What are the statistics?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Annex A has columns stating the amount of money to be given to each local authority. We are asked to say whether that is reasonable and fair, but I have not the slightest idea how we can make a judgment. The most obvious point is that we do not know the total number of children in each authority. It would be helpful if we knew that. When the Minister gives the definition of deprivation that she thinks we should be using, will she say how many of the total number of children are in the deprived category?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we talk about whether the distribution is fair, it is much more significant to know the percentage of the total number who are deprived. It is not good enough simply to say that Surrey has a population of X and somewhere else has a population of Y, ergo we can work it out. We cannot do that, and we have no other means of knowing from the tables. For example, we do not know how to make any comparison on deprivation or how many children are fostered in each authority. We need to know that, as well as how many children are in care in homes. How can we make a judgment about the fairness of the distribution? We need to know about the supervision arrangements and to what extent the social services being provided to children can be compared, like for like, between each authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Using the standard spending assessment is a recipe for disaster. The Minister should be able to give us hard facts about the numbers and the elements of deprivation that she and the SSA are using. How many children are at risk in Surrey compared with somewhere else, and to what extent is that relevant? We must go through the entire list of possible measures of deprivation before we can say whether the amounts payable to each authority are right, and even if we get it right, it will all be torn up. What will we have then? What assurances can we have for long-term planning? We should not do this on a year-by-year basis; there should be a long-term rolling programme of improvement and investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can any local authority be sure that funding will continue if the rules are rewritten? If I understand the consultation document correctly, there will be a serious shift of money from parts of the country such as mine to other parts. That will raise a huge dilemma for local authorities: do they cut services and investment in deprived children or put the council tax up? You will be pleased to hear that I will not debate the council tax, Mr. Hood, but we are putting the continuity of the service at risk if we start tearing up agreements. That is a good reason why we should not use a formula to determine the grants, but instead work county by county, and local authority by local authority, to determine each one's problems and make
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0100">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
an investment on the basis of what we discover. It is nonsense to use the grand formulae, which include an element of what the fire brigade is doing or what the lending of library books is like, to determine grants. Those are my concerns about the amounts payable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Annexe A, which I mentioned in relation to fairness, confuses me. Columns 2 and 3 relate to revenue spending and, if I understand it correctly, column 4 relates to capital spending. I was always under the impression that a great rule of public expenditure, finance and local and national Government accountability was that revenue and capital were different and should never be brought together. They raise separate accounting, accountability and revenue-raising issues. Even in allocations to the Department of Health and the Treasury, one column relates to capital spending within the budgets of the UK and the other to continuing revenue costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister feel that it is right to come to us with a muddled list of figures, in which two columns are one thing and one column is another? How do they relate to repayment of debt and loan amounts? What is the situation regarding that spot of confusion? For example, the various columns on my county of Surrey are as follows: £1.6 million revenue, £0.1 million revenue, £0.1 million capital and a total of £1.9 million. My county's accounts cannot show the figures like that because, of the £1.9 million, some is revenue and some capital. The money must be shown differently, so how can anyone who examines the annual report produced by Surrey get a grip on whether the local authority is following the Government's requirements?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also concerned about asylum seekers. Kent was mentioned as having to deal with 1,400 asylum seekers' children—more than the number within the county—plus those coming out of London and placed into homes in the county. What allowances are made for counties such as Kent that have that extra burden? Gatwick airport is another example, though it is closer to the heart of my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham than to mine. I am more concerned about Heathrow airport. It never ceases to amaze me that some people can put children on an aircraft without any documentation or adult supervision. Lo and behold, major airports suffer the tragedy of young children just appearing and needing to be looked after. Are allowances going to be made for that abomination? They certainly should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another problem appears in annex C on page 9, which deals with "Use of grant monies":
	<br><q><p>"Each local authority shall … use the grant monies specified in column 2 of Annex A only in the financial year 2002/2003"—</p></q>
I shall return to that in a moment—
	<br><q><p>"and only for the purpose of implementing the Quality Protects Action Plan number 4".</p></q>
That takes us back to ring fencing. The Government are correct in saying that they do not much care for ring fencing. I have never cared for it either, and I used to tell my own Government so. When I was in local government, I used to ask myself why I should be used
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
as a contractor, given some money and told that I had no choice over what to do with it. That is not local democracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government, bless them, keep telling us that they do not like ring fencing—and I congratulate them on that. In that case, will the Minister explain why a ring-fenced proposal is before us? What is the point giving local authorities money when they have no scope to decide what to do with it? On page 9 of the report, paragraph 3(1)(a), (b) and (c) prescribe exactly what the money should be spent on; in each case, it is locked in to what the Government decide is right for local people. That is not proper or democratic. If the Government believed in democracy, they would specify their objectives, encourage and support, but they would allow local people to specify their priorities in the end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not making a party political point—it applies to councillors of all political persuasions—but Surrey county councillors know more about the problems facing the children of Surrey than any Government in Westminster will ever know. We should not be ring fencing, but breaking this down and allowing local democracy to do what it is best at—deciding on local priorities, which will differ from place to place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we turn over to page 10, we reach "Other conditions". One tries to tie up all such documents, but there is often a sting in the tail. If all else fails, provisions at the end make absolutely certain that any possible freedom that might have escaped the preceding requirements is put back in its cage. Paragraph 7 on page 10 states:
	<br><q><p>"If a local authority does not spend the whole of the grant monies in the financial year 2002/2003, then the local authority shall repay to the Secretary of State an amount equal to such part of the grant monies as the local authority has not spent".</p></q>
That is madness, and explains why at the end of every year, someone is told to tarmac the car park; the money has to be used, not given back. It is a wasteful and silly way of trying to help children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even at revenue, let alone capital level, many tasks take more than one year to do. The system also militates against starting anything late in the year because the money will not be used up before the end of the year. In any case, councils do not know how much money they will be allotted until three months have gone, so they are already further advanced towards the end of the year than they should be. It becomes extremely difficult to spend all the money in the 12 months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only are the Government being silly in saying that the money must be spent in a year, but the fact that they knock out the first three months of the year before anything is certain makes things doubly difficult. I beg the Minister to plead with the Treasury for some common sense, if the proposal is Treasury-inspired—and most such proposals are. Provided that the money allocated is used within a sensible framework and timetable—that will vary from place to place and from circumstance to circumstance—and with a reasonable sense of urgency, there is no need for a provision stating that it must all be spent this year. However, if the Government insist on such a proposal, the car park
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0101">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
in every children's home is certain to be splendid, but probably not the services inside it, because that is how people will be forced to operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to add to what the hon. Member for Cheadle said in respect of paragraph 6, which says what happens if
	<br><q><p>"a local authority fails to comply".</p></q>
Have any local authorities failed to comply? What are the definitions of failure? It is easy enough to write along the lines of, "If you don't do what we tell you, we want the money back," but exactly how will that be measured? What criteria will be used?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That sort of penalty worries me. I can understand why it is sometimes necessary to intervene because, sadly, from time to time we fail children, and part of the blame can be put on the local authority. I do not dispute that; it is human nature, it is regrettable, but it happens. I do not have any difficulty, therefore, with the Government or an inspectorate saying that they must have a reserve power to intervene if things get out of control. But to demand repayment is in effect to fine the authority for its failure, because that would come to light only after the money had been spent and the aim of the expenditure had not been achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Intervention would almost certainly be after the event rather than before it. The money will have been spent, the Government will have intervened and demanded repayment, but that money will no longer be available. So how will the local authority get the money, halfway or three quarters of the way through a year? There is only thing it can do: cut some other service to pay the money back. Although I support the principle of a reserve power to intervene, using what amounts to a fine is a very clumsy way of safeguarding the interests of the children and of the taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 8 refers to a local authority that has used its money to buy capital assets. When these are no longer used or are disposed of, it is sensible to provide for the Secretary of State to say, "Hang on a minute. If you buy a load of IT equipment and then do not use it while it is still ring-fenced, something must happen." But I am nervous about the term "full market value" in paragraph 8. It does not sound unreasonable provided that the stuff is actually sold. But the paragraph says that full market value
	<br><q><p>"shall be determined by the Secretary of State".</p></q>
I cannot call to mind any Secretary of State in this or any previous Government who was a valuer. Why on earth should the Secretary of State determine the market value of anything? He is probably the last person to do so, as he has no relevant qualifications whatever. I suspect that whether the value was high or low would depend on what the Secretary of State felt about the authority; the scope for gerrymandering is huge. I ask the Minister to consider including a sentence stating that the market value will be determined by experts who understand the market values of the equipment concerned. Then there might be some justice in the proposition, which at present depends on a political whim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Annex D refers to regional development worker grant. I have rummaged about a bit and I cannot find
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
the information that the Committee needs. I have not been able to find an explanation of why those authorities have been specified. I puzzled over whether some geography was involved, but they do not seem to be concentrated in any particular region; there almost seems to be a national arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It then occurred to me that either those might be very good authorities, which represent good practice that we are working to spread around, or they might be failing authorities, which need some extra help. So what do the star ratings tell us about them? Not to put too fine a point on it, not a lot. Brighton and Hove is a one-star authority, Westminster city council is a three-star authority. Clearly we cannot take this either as a list of best practice or a list of bad practice. I simply ask the Minister: what is the significance of this wondrous little collection? Even politics does not help us, because the political control of these authorities is spread far and wide. We have dates and figures, but for some unfathomable reason Gateshead metropolitan borough council requires a reference all of its own. Why? Is it the only council in the country that has a different accounting year? What is going on? Are we trying to cook the books to give Gateshead extra help that we hope Parliament will not notice? We were owed an explanation at the beginning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is tempting to say that these are not particularly important points, but they might be extremely important. This is what my bones tell me. There is a reference to needing to invest the money in order to deliver the change required. If those authorities need to deliver more change than elsewhere, I am worried about the way in which that is being done. I estimate that the total sum of money made available to help children is being top-sliced. A considerable amount of money is being taken away from what is generally available for distribution under annex A, and taken across to annex D to be given to those authorities. If those authorities have problems with their children's services, the Government are rewarding failure rather than excellence. That worries me. If Surrey does not figure here because Surrey is good and they are bad, why should Surrey get less help? There should be a different way of dealing with failure. There should be a different way of making extra change rather than penalising the rest of the country by giving us less.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are serious matters. As I said at the beginning, the principle is absolutely right. I am totally behind the Government in their wish to do more to help the children in our society, particularly the vulnerable. On the other hand, we should not turn our backs when it is done unfairly, using a formula that we do not understand, and which we would not like if we did, when we cannot make comparisons and a quarter of the year goes by before the process can start. We should not turn our backs when it is done in a way that is, frankly, second rate, and when it could be done in a far better way if only the Government thought harder.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jacqui Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I will be able to respond to most of the points that hon. Members have made, and I shall start with those made by the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham. As I think that I stated in the performance fund debate last week, star
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0102">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
ratings do not affect the amount allocated to different authorities. In relation to the performance fund, star ratings affected the freedom and flexibility to spend that amount. They have not affected the children's fund this year but, as we discussed last week, next year they will determine authorities' flexibility when it comes to spending that fund and how that spending is monitored. The level of monitoring will be based on the quality of a council's services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the star rating system, social services inspectors will monitor all zero-star and one-star councils for progress made, by judging that progress against the main objectives of the programme and by taking into account all the available evidence from indicators, inspections and twice-yearly monitoring. On the other hand, three-star councils will have full responsibility for development and approval of local schemes to address the quality protects priorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Tim Loughton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that the star rating system does not affect the amount of money handed out. However, the Minister just said that a council with a zero star or one star will undergo a lot of monitoring, and that such authorities must jump through many hoops and comply with a great deal. When considering the distribution of the money, was any account taken of the extra costs incurred by authorities that do not have three stars and which have to comply with monitoring? That is the real question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jacqui Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We discussed the funding of monitoring and assessment in relation to the performance fund. The monitoring process for zero-star and one-star councils has been set out. Three-star councils earn the flexibility to have removed from them the dead hand of Government, as some Opposition Members see it. We are not talking about additional monitoring. As I said in my introductory remarks, we are reducing across the board the amount of monitoring and form filling needed for the management action plans, and for some of the other plans that we expect from local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Tim Loughton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not the same as what the Minister said earlier. The phrase that she used was "lighter touch regulation" or "lighter touch monitoring". That is different from full-scale monitoring, however scaled down it may be. If there is no differentiation between the level of monitoring and the level of compliance required for that monitoring, what is the difference between being a three-star authority and a zero-star authority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jacqui Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman misunderstands me. I argued, as I did last Thursday, that we are reducing bureaucracy and the planning burden for all authorities by reducing the number of plans that they must produce and, in this case, the need to produce management action plans. We also go further by differentiating monitoring and inspection on the basis of the quality of the authority. We expect there to be less monitoring and less explicit consideration of the outcomes for three-star authorities, because they have proved themselves more able to deliver objectives than have zero-star or one-star authorities. I believe that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
people understand the responsibility of the Government and the inspectorate to ensure that zero-star or one-star authorities deliver in a way that they had not proved themselves able to do, which was why they were rated zero-star and one-star.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. Members raised the issue of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children. Such children are not funded through this route, but by a special Home Office grant that is claimed for each unaccompanied asylum-seeking child. Therefore, the formula did not include a specific factor for asylum-seeking children, although the circular highlighted the issue and asked councils to set out in their MAPs how they ensured good-quality services for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children. The responsibility for asylum and, in this case, funding rests with the Home Office, but the welfare of asylum-seeking children often rests with social services departments. The assessment of those needs is based on the framework for the assessment of children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Tim Loughton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that point, I draw the Minister's attention again to the example of my local authority in West Sussex, and to the additional costs of about £1 million that I quoted. The full amount refunded through the Home Office is nowhere near the actual cost to local authorities for looking after children who arrive through Gatwick airport or elsewhere. The Home Office does not make up for that shortfall, so it must come out of the general pool of money under discussion. The money is not fully compensated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jacqui Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made his call for more funds from the Home Office, and I am sure that it has heard it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilshire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jacqui Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman spoke at some length, and we have only until 6 pm, but if he insists, I shall give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilshire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are one or two points that I could have covered but did not. Instead of simply saying that authorities should take the matter up with the Home Office if it does not provide enough money, will the Minister reflect on the fact that the Home Office figure is based on a general assessment of the cost of keeping someone in care in this country and that it overlooks the fact that that costs far more in south-east England? It is therefore no surprise that we are underfunded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jacqui Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that authorities should take it up with the Home Office and that there is not enough money. I outlined where the money comes from to support unaccompanied asylum-seeking children. I hate to get party political in a Committee such as this, but when I hear representatives from Conservative-controlled county councils such as Kent bemoan the shortfall in their funding for vulnerable children, I have to ask why they have not put more pressure on Conservative Members of Parliament to vote for the increases in social services budgets. Conservative Members cannot stand—	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Hon. Members must allow the Minister to speak.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Jacqui Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Conservative Members cannot stand up and whinge at length about the money available for their authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Tim Loughton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes we can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jacqui Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, they can, but not with any justification. When it comes to voting on the increases that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor has made available to social services, the Conservatives go through the "No" Lobby. To use the hon. Gentlemen's phraseology, that is disingenuous at best and political hypocrisy at worst.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to move on. There has been much discussion about the SSA formula, and the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham seemed to get bogged down in the question of whether an authority was in inner or outer London. The SSA formula is not based the category of authority. It is more sophisticated, but to simplify the presentation, we present the authorities in that way. Several hon. Members asked about the evaluation of the management action plans. Two MAPs were formally sent back for resubmission, and the social services inspectorate asked some other authorities to fill in gaps and clarify what they meant. That is appropriate, because we are talking not about punishing local authorities, but about ensuring that they have plans in place to show that they will make the best use of the money before they spend it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members also asked about the co-ordination with other Government initiatives. The policy complements three other important programmes: sure start, the children's fund and Connexions. It is important that the delivery of those programmes is coordinated locally, and we have set up a quality protects reference group at Government level, with members from the key Government Departments including the Department for Education and Skills, the Treasury and the social exclusion unit, to co-ordinate the work. We will develop that further with the children's national service framework, which will bring together services for children and their development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. Members also asked about the future of the grant and the issue of ring fencing. In my introduction, I outlined how we have listened to local government concerns that too much local authority money is ring-fenced. The hon. Member for Spelthorne (Mr. Wilshire) accused us of ring-fencing by stealth, but we have always said that the quality protects grant is ring-fenced. We are now saying that, from 2004, the quality protects money will not be ring-fenced, but included in mainstream budgets. That also meets the concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Cheadle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was some confusion from the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham, who appeared to want to ask for the money to be ring-fenced and then approved of the call from the hon. Member for Spelthorne to end to ring fencing. We are confident that the purpose of ring fencing—to promote improvement and develop new services—has been delivered during the past five years, and it is now appropriate that the quality protects grant is included in all the other resources going to local authorities for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
expenditure on children, and that we mainstream that activity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Tim Loughton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To clear up any confusion, I should point out that I am as much against ring fencing as my hon. Friend the Member for Spelthorne is. I want a guarantee from the Minister that when we reach 2004, the quality protects money will not simply fizzle out, but will be retained in a freer form with its full value. More children will be dealt with, because of adoption support services and everything else that must be funded as part of that. Will the Minister guarantee that the money will not be ring-fenced, but will be available to the local authorities that have set up the various services and that have an ongoing responsibility to an increasing number of children?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jacqui Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I said that we intended that money to move into the baseline, so that we could continue to build on the good work done under quality protects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham asked a question about the increase in looked-after children. I understand the increase from March 2000 to March 2001 to be 1 per cent. I do not disagree with him: the challenge is not only the numbers of children in care, but the increasing level of need among those children. That is precisely why we needed the boost to services and the ability to change services that quality protects offered in many authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is right to say that we need to recruit more people to social work. We are running a recruitment campaign and have had some success. There have been more than 22,000 calls to the helpline. I can assure him that our intention is not to reduce the quality of those coming into social work, which is why we are introducing a three-year degree qualification for social work and professionalising that key job at the heart of protecting the most vulnerable children in our community. The hon. Gentleman asked detailed questions about recruitment figures; I shall read the record of our debate and write to him about anything that I have not covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Cheadle and for Spelthorne asked whether the money had been paid. It has not, because Parliament must approve the special grant report for it to be paid. The hon. Member for Spelthorne said, "But we are a quarter of the way through the year." In fact, it is probably a few weeks more than a quarter, but in any case the grant is paid a quarter in arrears. The grant will be paid for this quarter in arrears on the basis of the report's being approved today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilshire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the greatest respect to the Minister, whether the grant is paid in arrears is irrelevant. The point is that until Parliament approves the report, a council has not the slightest idea how much it will receive, whether in arrears or not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jacqui Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman would know had he listened to my introduction, that is completely wrong. All councils knew what their allocation was as a result of last December's local government circular All local authorities understood the process. They all
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0104">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
knew in May whether their MAPs had been approved. The hon. Gentleman claims to have experience of local government, so he must understand the process and the fact that local authorities will have been working pretty much with certainty about receiving the money and what their allocation will be. In fact, authorities will be prevented from being paid the money and being able to get on with spending it only if the hon. Gentleman continues in the same vein and is obstructive about money going to authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilshire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister must now answer a very simple question. If she is correct in saying that local authorities already know how much they will receive, what on earth are we doing here this afternoon? It is contempt of Parliament to say that they already know, because that means that this debate, any vote that we have and any decision that we take have been preempted by a dictatorial Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jacqui Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall move on to information technology. The hon. Member for Cheadle made an important point about the support that we must continue to give people leaving care. I can assure her that the Children (Leaving Care) Act 2000 provides support for those in continuing education beyond the age of 21. That will include IT equipment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have no plans to recruit beyond the current eight and a half full-time equivalent regional development workers and their assistants. To the extent that they work with local authorities, they will influence adoption. In the second part of this afternoon's proceedings, we can say more about the Department's support for adoption. The regional development workers were selected when councils were willing to offer individuals with the necessary skills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Spelthorne was not listening when I explained the basis of the regional development worker grant. It allows for reimbursement based on current salary and on-costs of the individuals released by the authorities to work as regional development workers for quality protects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked about Gateshead. Last year the report included a similar section on the reimbursement of authorities for regional development workers in Gateshead. The Gateshead worker started work at the beginning of March, so there was no authority in last year's report to reimburse Gateshead for costs. That is why we have included it in this report for the scrutiny of Parliament—including and the hon. Gentleman. However, I am not sure that that is a particularly good use of Parliament's time. If the same problem arose this year, with one worker stopping and another from another authority appointed, we could reimburse that authority for costs. That makes sense and conforms to the spirit of reducing bureaucracy, for which hon. Members have called today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Spelthorne asked about SSA allocation, and he now has the opportunity to participate in the Government's current consultation. He was concerned about the fact that there are two different sources of money for quality protects. He
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
tempts me, so I shall account for the different figures in the report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main programme is outlined in the special grant report. The £15 million is for disabled children and the IT allocation applies to looked-after children. Money is also allocated for regional development workers. The money to support the Children (Leaving Care) Act 2000 comes through quality protects. It is partly a transfer from the Department for Work and Pensions, because the 2000 Act changed the basis of support for 16 and 17-year-olds from benefits to a much more flexible and sensitive system of support by local authorities. That transfer achieves precisely what the hon. Member for Spelthorne argued for, and unifies support for vulnerable children. Finally, new money is available to support care leavers, but it is allocated through a different route, so it is not the subject of today's report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can assure the hon. Gentleman that details about both the current determination of the children's block of the social services SSA and what is proposed in consultation are available in the consultation document, which might be a better source of information about the distributional effects than the 	<i>Daily Mail.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked several questions about how to find evidence about the services that local authorities provide. Thanks to the present Government, the performance indicators of social services departments are published every year. They spell out answers to many of the hon. Gentleman's questions, and he will have been sent a copy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for capital and revenue, I cannot believe that accountants in Surrey have such difficulty determining the distinction between the £15 million capital for IT and the other revenue allocated. That was not the hon. Gentleman's most significant concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Calton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of explanation, I understood the Minister to say that the grant did not apply to over-16s who fell within the terms of the 2000 Act. According to annex C, section 24(1) of the Children Act 1989 applies to the conditions governing the quality protects grant. It says:
	<br><q><p>"'a person qualifying for advice and assistance' means a person within the area of the authority who is under twenty-one and who was, at any time after reaching the age of sixteen but while still a child … is no longer so looked after, accommodated or fostered."</p></q>
Are we talking about two overlapping grants, or is the money being funded through one or the other? I do not understand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jacqui Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point was that I did not want to risk being accused of over-announcing the money. Heaven forbid. I was just clarifying the fact that the overall amounts go through quality protects, but that this grant report relates only to part of it, with other parts of the grant under the 2000 Act going through a different route.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Tim Loughton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister finishes speaking, will she deal with a question that she has not yet answered? After 2004, when the quality protects money will cease to be ring-fenced, what will happen if the local authorities have not achieved the 11 key objectives that they are tasked with
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0105">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
achieving? Will new criteria equivalent to the quality protects money be adopted, and will the authorities lose out?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jacqui Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, because we are shifting towards a system of measuring and monitoring outcomes. The ability of authorities to meet those and other objectives is evaluated in the performance indicators and included in the star ratings. We are correctly shifting emphasis away from how much money is going into an authority towards what services are produced for vulnerable children. That is precisely why we are debating this report—to allocate to local authorities continuing investment to make a difference to the lives of our most vulnerable children, which quality protects has hitherto provided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This special grant is rather less money, I have to admit, but it is still important. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I do not know whether the hon. Member for Spelthorne is promising us less time or threatening us with more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased that we have the opportunity to debate this special grant report, which relates to the funding of the adoption and permanence taskforce. Significant developments in adoption and permanence have taken place since the Prime Minister announced a review of adoption in February 2000. We published the White Paper in December 2000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The adoption and permanence taskforce has been working to spread good practice and support improvement. In the year to 31 March 2001 the proportion of looked after children being placed for adoption increased by 12 per cent. on the previous year, and was 40 per cent. more than in 1998–99. The adoption register has been launched, bringing together potential adopters with children needing families. We have published national adoption standards and draft practice guidance, and we have set a new target for the time scale within which children should be placed for adoption: 95 per cent. of looked after children are to be placed for adoption within 12 months of the decision that adoption is in the child's best interest. That will be an increase from 81 per cent. in March this year. Those of us who were involved in the Adoption and Children Bill know that we have been working on modernising the legal framework for domestic and inter-country adoption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
One of the many recommendations in the performance and innovation unit report commissioned by the Prime Minister was that we should set up an adoption and permanence task force to spread best practice, tackle poor performance and help all local authorities reach the standards of the best. To make early progress on that, the Minister of State for Health, my right hon. Friend the Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Hutton), announced in October 2000 that a new adoption and permanence taskforce was to be set up. The initiative had, and continues to have, the support of both the Association of Directors of Social Services and the Local Government Association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cost of the taskforce in 2001–02 was about £250,000. The taskforce achieved considerable success in its first year and we are keen for it to continue. I am delighted that the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea has agreed to host the taskforce. Hon. Members will be aware that it achieved three stars in the star ratings for overall performance of social services. This special grant report enables us to pay it for the costs of the taskforce. The approach of the taskforce is to stress the key importance of ensuring permanent and secure attachments for vulnerable children and young people. The work focuses on the quality of planning for looked-after children to ensure that we make those opportunities available for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The taskforce is chaired by the chief inspector of social services and headed by Mike Lauerman, previously director of social services at Hartlepool. It currently has 33 part-time members, who are experienced practitioners and managers in children's services and, in some cases, experienced users. Most have particular experience and expertise in working within the looked-after-children system. To respond to the point that the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham made earlier, I can tell the Committee that the taskforce also works closely with and ties into the network of the quality protects regional development workers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the first year the taskforce worked intensively with eight councils who were keen to improve their adoption services. We got clear feedback on the positive results of the taskforce regarding the number of children being successfully placed for adoption as well as those who are being provided with secure attachments, either with their own families or through planned long-term foster care. The taskforce has also developed good practice materials and has arranged some successful workshops with the courts. For phase 2, all directors of social services were offered the opportunity to work with the taskforce during 2002; 40 councils expressed an interest in doing that and 12 were selected to work with the taskforce. I am pleased to say that the taskforce has already commenced work with 11 of the 12 councils; the remaining council will be visited this summer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilshire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would be grateful if the Minister could tell us which councils those were.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jacqui Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a minute I will give the hon. Gentleman a list. I am not sure whether I wrote to all hon. Members or just to those with a particular interest. We will review the work of the taskforce in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0106">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>27</span>
the autumn to see whether it has the capacity to help further councils, either on an individual basis or as groups. I am now in a position to tell the hon. Gentleman—I am sure that he will be pleased to hear it—that the 12 selected councils for phase 2 are Blackburn with Darwen, Cambridgeshire, Dorset, Halton, Hammersmith and Fulham, Manchester, Merton, Redcar and Cleveland, Sheffield, Southend on Sea, Stockport and Wigan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am very pleased with the work that the taskforce has completed to date. There have been tangible benefits. It shows the benefits that can be gained by putting leaders in adoption in touch with each other. I am anxious that we build on the success of the taskforce and I look forward to extending its work to a third wave of councils. Today's special grant report enables us to take that work forward, and I hope that it will be supported by the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.4 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Tim Loughton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course the Minister knows that we welcome the Adoption and Children Bill, especially as some hon. Members spent some six months of their lives working on it over the last parliamentary year. We hope that it will now proceed through the upper House. Under the Bill, many extra responsibilities will be placed on social services departments along the lines of those mentioned by the Minister. Adoption support services are especially affected, given the whole business of promoting adoptions that have a greater likelihood of being permanent and that work for the children involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Minister's almost glowing praise for Kensington and Chelsea—a typically well run Conservative authority whose social services department scored the highest rating, along with Wandsworth's. It received three stars, and was rated as serving adults and children excellently. Only those Conservative authorities received that 100 per cent. accolade. Half the eight authorities that received three stars were, of course, Conservative, which comes as no surprise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have several questions about the workings of the adoption and permanence taskforce. The Minister roughly sketched out its purpose, which is to support councils in: improving their performance in planning for, and delivering, permanence for looked-after children; maximising the use of adoption as an option to promote the needs of looked-after children; providing effective support to all parties affected by adoption; and providing a source of advice and expertise to inform policy development and implementation on adoption and permanence. Will the Minister say how much has been paid in total so far to reimburse local authorities for members involved in the taskforce?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The taskforce's annual report, which was published in October 2001, and subsequent Department of Health press releases, announced that an initial eight, and then another 12, councils were participating and receiving help. The 12 councils were selected from 40 that expressed an interest. Will the Minister give us
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
more details about how the 12 councils in the second phase were selected for receiving help and best practice training from the taskforce? It might have been helpful to have the list of councils as additional research in advance of our consideration of the special grant report. Are the councils predominantly no star, one star or two star? The range of authorities in the list appears to be diverse. Why were the other 29 authorities that expressed an interest not selected? Answers to those questions would help the Committee and give a steer in the future to authorities with an interest in sharing in the work of the taskforce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister comment on how the work of the taskforce interacts with the Government's idea of sending hit squads in to councils with failing social services departments? If those councils coincide with authorities that receive help from the taskforce, does its work overlap with that of the hit squads? Does it work alongside them? Would not help be given to authorities that are the subject of hit squads? Must the councils who take the taskforce's help implement its recommendations? What happens if they do not take its help? The taskforce's annual report says that it is there not to criticise the working of social services departments, but merely to offer—and I quote—"best practice". Who ultimately decides whether authorities should take any notice of it? Does the taskforce have any real teeth or it is purely an advisory body, whose advice councils would be foolish not to take? We have not heard much detail about the practicalities of how taskforce members will work with authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report does not say how much Kensington and Chelsea is being reimbursed for its involvement in the taskforce, or how many officers are involved, the time span of their work and in what capacity they will be used. Will the Minister elaborate on that? We are delighted that Kensington and Chelsea has been chosen to act as the host, which I am sure is the right decision. Reading the taskforce's annual report, I noticed that it will help local authorities improve their best practice plans for adoption. However, does the taskforce work solely on the management action plans for the adoption sections of quality protects or on all aspects of adoption policies? What was the working relationship between the taskforce members and quality protects regional development workers, whom we discussed earlier under the other grant report? Again, the annual report does not give any detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the members of the taskforce are experts in their field and work in voluntary and statutory bodies involved in adoption, but how is the taskforce's success measured? The Minister alluded to an assessment that will be carried out this autumn, so will Parliament have an opportunity to scrutinise whether its work has been successful? In our earlier debate, she said that it would be far more important to assess outcomes rather than the money put into the project. Will she give us a framework for how we can assess the taskforce's effectiveness and how much better the authorities that avail themselves of its advice become as a result?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We welcome the fact that the taskforce was set up. It was established to produce a significant change in performance for adoption services and permanence otherwise, and I applaud the Government's motives in wanting to do that. From my knowledge of social services departments, I know that too many children have been denied the opportunity to live in a family because of the bureaucratic and counterproductive procedures in both fostering and adoption. I welcome the lead role of the royal borough of Kensington and Chelsea, which according to the Government's star rating system is serving children and young people well and has excellent prospects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have only a couple of questions, which have been partially covered already. How large is the taskforce and from where will its members be recruited? I hope that the permanence aspect is not ignored, and that fostering is recognised as an important part of adoption and permanence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilshire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am conscious of the fact that most Committee members probably have an invitation to a barbecue later this evening, so I shall do my level best not to keep them from their supper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said on the last occasion, I support the general principles wholeheartedly. I doubt that we would find a colleague in the House who would not say that we should support this good initiative. However, having said that, going back to my days in local government—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I have no intention of going back just yet—perhaps after 7.30 pm, but not before. If in my local government days I had ever got hold of such a document referring to my council, I would not have been able to believe my luck. It is a wondrous document. It should be retitled the bottomless bucket grant, because nowhere in it is there a limit on what Kensington and Chelsea can be given. It is a wonderful arrangement. Whatever happened to cash-limiting? This is the first piece of paper I have seen from any Government that says, "We will make a grant of all relevant expenditure." If I were a local authority treasurer, or leader, as I used to be, I would have a field day if I was told that all relevant expenditure would be reimbursed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister tell the Committee what arrangements are in place to keep the lid on that? She said that only £250,000 is involved, but there is no way of stopping the figure being double or treble that amount. The children who are being helped would no doubt be delighted, but paragraph 3 on page 1 states:
	<br><q><p>"Before making these determinations and before specifying the conditions, the Secretary of State obtained the consent of the Treasury."</p></q>
That beggars belief. Are we really being told that Her Majesty's Treasury said to the Secretary of State for Health, "Go on. You can put this before Parliament. You can let this lot spend as much as they like."? Was the Treasury having a bad day? Was it not explained to it what this all about? As I said earlier, I am all for local freedom, but I am not in the business of signing blank cheques on behalf of my constituents, who are taxpayers. Will the Minister reassure me, and disappoint Kensington and Chelsea, by saying that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
the report is not suggesting a bottomless bucket approach?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister also tell us where the money will come from? I suspect that that is at the heart of the question why the Treasury's permission is needed. Has someone in the Department of Health raided the piggy bank? If so, have there been appraisals of the competing bids? It is all very well to say that it is splendid if there is a little pot of money tucked away for things, but if it comes under a budget heading for money set aside for a range of such projects, we should ask if there was any appraisal of their value? I would hate to think that just because the Prime Minister thought it was a good idea, somebody found the money. I hope that nobody thinks that that is the way to run the Government. There must have been some appraisal that found that this proposition was more important than anything else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Alternatively, was the Treasury consulted because the money came from its little pot, not one in the Department of Health? If the Treasury is the source of the money and can say, "Here's a little bit more for you," I am deeply suspicious, because a system in which Chancellors of the Exchequer have money under the bed that they dole out to their friends contains enormous scope for political corruption. The Minister must tell us where the money will come from and why the Treasury had to be consulted. I doubt that she will be able to tell us why the Treasury agreed, because she is not a crystal ball reader, and the Treasury will have to answer for itself. There must be some means of controlling the expenditure, but I am bio wed if I can see it in the document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were told that the royal borough of Kensington and Chelsea was the best authority for the task. I can understand why the Minister did not want to be too effusive in praising a Conservative council, but it is significant that when she wanted help she turned to one of the best run Conservative authorities in the country, and I applaud her for doing so. I hope she will do that again, because if she wants the Government's money used well, she should let Conservatives do it, not the spendthrift, wasteful authorities run by her party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Annex A mentions "relevant expenditure" but it does not say who determines what is relevant. A little later, it says that someone has to certify that expenditure is relevant, but nowhere does it say that a decision must be taken on who that person should be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

People may be asked to do something on behalf of the Government— I went round that course in my local government days—and they do what they think is supposed to be done, in good faith, on a promise of being reimbursed. However, if there is no watertight definition of what will be refunded, they may discover afterwards that they have spent money that they do not get back.

issue. What appeal can be made against the person who does the determining if it is not done properly?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assume that, having chosen Kensington and Chelsea, the Government will include the full salaries of the officers concerned when dealing with relevant expenditure. I should be grateful if the Minister would confirm that. If that is the case, it is right, but also curious, because when the Government determine what the salaries of local government officers in the south-east should be in general, they do not take into account the full cost of paying such officers or anyone else working in the public sector in the south-east.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is relevant expenditure some mystical average figure for what it costs to employ someone in the country generally? That tends to be the case when there are problems with the SSA. Or are the Government accepting once and for all that people in the southeast, particularly London, must be paid a proper rate? If that decision has been taken in this case, it undermines the arguments about why that should not be done for all other local government services in the south-east.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also concerned about the phrase "and associated administrative costs". Again, those who want to get to the barbecue will think that I am being pedantic, but I can assure them from bitter experience that such a phrase can result in quite a few people coming to grief. Does it cover accommodation costs? Some might argue that administration and accommodation are two entirely different things. Are the costs of the office space being occupied by the people reimbursed? The council tax payers of Kensington and Chelsea provide it. Do administrative costs include secretarial support? Is the cost of recruitment included, as well as that of the salaries? More importantly, is the cost of supervision included? In my book that is all relevant expenditure, but it might not be in the definition that the Minister uses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Annex B says that
	<br><q><p>"the Prime Minister launched the Performance and Innovation Unit Review of Adoption".</p></q>
If there was a problem, why was the Prime Minister required to intervene to deal with it? Why on earth did the Secretary of State not spot it, rather than waiting to be instructed by Downing street to do something about it? Is that an example of Downing street poking its nose into things, or do we have an incompetent Secretary of State? I should welcome the Minister's clarification as to which answer is correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report states that the taskforce
	<br><q><p>"has a membership of experienced practitioners".</p></q>
We have been told how many and who they are, but I am interested in supervision, and who determines how many there will be. The unit is placed within local government, and local government is very much involved. In addition, relevant expenditure can be claimed back. Are the Government keeping control of the numbers, or does that rest with Kensington and Chelsea? We need to know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
The report refers to who is appointed. That includes a director, but there is the potential for mayhem when a director might have to report to two people. Will the Minister clarify whether the director takes his instructions from, and reports to, the Department of Health, Kensington and Chelsea, or both? If the answer is both, what arrangements have been put in place to resolve disputes? It would be a tragedy if this initiative, which we all support, collapsed in acrimonious disputes between a local council and a Department of State. I sincerely hope that arrangements are in place to deal with the reporting relationship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report states on page 5:
	<br><q><p>"The authority may make a claim for grant monies only in respect of relevant expenditure incurred or likely to be incurred during the financial year 2002/2003."</p></q>
That in itself is not unreasonable, provided that the Minister can assure us that it does not preclude the taskforce from making commitments to made expenditure in a following year. If the money that can be repaid is for this year and there is a complete ban on thinking and planning for next year until it gets to next year's grant, it will be working with its hands tied behind its back. Everything that it does will be short term. Could the Minister confirm that although it can only have a grant repayment of what it spends this year, it can plan and commit ahead in the knowledge that it will get support for that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another aspect of the part of the report headed "Claims" puzzles me. A lot of paperwork has to .be completed and handed in no later than 28 February 2003, but if I understand it correctly, the grant is made payable on 31 March. Under paragraph 4(2)(b) the poor person completing this paperwork is asked to make an estimate of relevant expenditure up to 31 March. I am curious to know why it does not say that at the end of the year someone will give us the figures. Why does the Minister want it a month early so that someone must guess at what the rest will be? If that guess is inaccurate, either a repayment will have to be made, or another lot of paperwork will have to be completed. Another meeting or two will have to be held and up will go the administrative costs. Why must we have these two separate dates for the same financial exercise? I should be grateful if the Minister could clear that point up for us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the "Certified statement" on page 6, which brings us back to the question of accountability. When the taskforce draws up the accounts of what it has spent, the council's chief finance officer has to certify them. That is probably right in accounting terms. However, what happens if a chief finance officer, who is independent and says that his job is to certify the accounts without fear or favour, disagrees with the definition of relevant expenditure laid down by the Secretary of State? That is why I query who is to decide. If the Secretary of State says that it means something, but a qualified accountant, whose job is on the line if he does not follow accounting law, disagrees, what mechanism does the Minister have to resolve the dispute?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister says that the reporting relationship between the director and the superior is centred on the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0109">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
Department of Health, there will be problems. There will be a director whose line management at day-today level is carried out by the Department of Health, but whose financial responsibility is to the chief finance officer of a local authority. If anything has a capacity for confused reporting relationships, misunderstandings, bickering and failure of projects, this arrangement has. I should be grateful if the Minister could think carefully about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have only one point—or perhaps two—to make about the passage headed "Other conditions". Condition 7 says:
	<br><q><p>"Where any amount of grant has been paid other than in respect of the authority's relevant expenditure",</p></q>
it has to be repaid. As it is being paid on a certified statement that it is relevant expenditure, why do we need that provision? It is not as if one were paying a grant up front and hoping that in due course it would all be all right. One is getting these accounts in and then one is paying out. Condition 7 is needed only if the Secretary of State is going to overrule the chief finance officer whose professional job it was to certify that it was accurate. Why do we need the additional provision?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I promise that this is my final comment, Mr. Hood. Under paragraph 8 of annex C, the Government are creating a mechanism to deal with things that were not done correctly in financial terms. That amounts to the same point, which I will not repeat. It is a fining mechanism. If something goes wrong, money that has already been spent will be taken away, and the victims of that will be the council tax payers of that wonderful Conservative authority, Kensington and Chelsea.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.29 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jacqui Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham asked how much would be paid out to reimburse councils for the taskforce. I made it clear in my introductory remarks that in 2001–02 the taskforce cost about £250,000, which is what we expect during 2002–03. Many of the questions asked by the hon. Member for Spelthorne fundamentally misunderstand the purpose of the special grant report, which is to provide a legal mechanism to allow the Government to spend money to support the taskforce hosted by Kensington and Chelsea. It does not give that authority an open cheque. It seems inappropriate to spend half the time lauding a particular authority, and the other half suggesting that it will somehow try to pull a fast one on the Government. The special grant report will give us the legal ability to fund Kensington and Chelsea to host the taskforce. All that enables us to cover some of the specific issues raised by the hon. Member for Spelthorne. The director of the taskforce will continue to report to the Department of Health on the functions that are being carried out. Kensington and Chelsea hosts the taskforce, so it seems appropriate that it should claim back the money that the taskforce costs it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are different dates in annex C because it is sensible for the authority claiming for the costs of hosting the taskforce to claim before the end of the financial year, to allow them to be paid in year. The hon. Gentleman also asked where the money was
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
coming from, and suggested that the Treasury might have some pocket of cash for its friends. Everyone in the Department of Health is a friend of the Chancellor and the Treasury, but in this case, that is not what happened. The taskforce is being funded out of the £6.5 million that is held centrally for supporting adoption services over three years. We previously discussed that money, and that is the source of the funding for the taskforce.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilshire</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have just heard a rather fascinating contradiction. Throughout two debates we have been told that everything must be spent this year. We now discover that the centre can roll out £6.5 million over several years. Why can the Department roll it forward, but the authorities cannot?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jacqui Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman cannot be that keen to get to his barbecue if he is making—dare I say it—such silly points. Of course the same accounting rules apply to the £6.5 million allocated over three years and in-year spend as apply to local authorities. I was just clarifying for the benefit of the Committee where the resources come from for the centrally funded operations that help to improve adoption and permanence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham asked how the authorities were selected. They were not selected on the basis that they were all failing, although some of them certainly had difficulties with their adoption service. Other local authorities in the list have an excellent service that they want to improve, and the taskforce will be able to work with them to share that good practice among other authorities. I will come to the taskforce's role in a moment. The authorities were selected according to a range of criteria, one of which was the ability to take part in that sort of activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said in my introduction—I recognise the point made by the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham—more authorities want to benefit from those opportunities than have been able to participate so far. That is why in the autumn we shall evaluate success and reflect on how to develop further opportunities for more local authorities. The taskforce has already produced good practice guidance and handy hints on a variety of issues, so its expertise is being diffused more broadly than the number of councils directly involved would suggest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that I had answered the question about numbers in the taskforce. It has one full-time director and 33 members who work perhaps two or three days a month on a consultancy basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Tim Loughton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall return to one point because I am slightly confused about the selection criteria. The Minister says that not only failing authorities or those with problems, but authorities that already have quite good services and want to improve them, are selected. The list of 12 includes Dorset, a two-star authority, and Merton, which has a zero-star rating. At least 28 more authorities are interested. Is it fair that the failing zero-rated authorities requiring help do not have priority over those that want to improve services that are already good? At this stage when opportunities are rationed, why should not the additional resources and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0110">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>35</span>
help of the taskforce be targeted at the failing authorities? Those who want to add to the excellent services that they already provide could be brought in later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jacqui Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The remaining 28 are not all failing authorities. The hon. Gentleman asked about the intervention role of the taskforce, but it was not set up as an intervention mechanism. That can be achieved in other ways. The taskforce was set up to work in partnership with local authorities either with weaknesses or a real commitment to improve. It is entirely appropriate that the taskforce works with both. Where authorities are clearly failing—as with the zero-star councils—we must do more. That is why we spelled out what would happen with zero-starred councils: direct contact with the chief inspector of the social services inspectorate; the production of a performance improvement plan; close monitoring by social services inspectors of the ability to translate that plan into effective action; and external assistance to effect the improvements. We also expected further improvement by November; otherwise, further action would be necessary. Both approaches have a rationale, but they are different and it benefits neither approach to confuse them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham asked what the taskforce was attempting to do in its work with councils. It is invited in to councils and works in partnership to produce a development plan for adoption and permanence practice. The taskforce believes that key issues must be tackled to produce the maximum impact on the councils. In some cases, those criteria need to be in existence already. They include: the state of council readiness for working with the taskforce; the commitment of councillors and senior management; the extent to which planning for permanence features in the underlying attitudes of managers and practitioners; the quality and relevance of plans for children who may be in long-term placements but
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
whose needs may not be sufficiently focused on; the quality and contents of information systems for tracking the progress of children; the way in which feedback is used to monitor and improve practice, including, for example, the way in which managers and members are involved in the process; the effectiveness of professional supervision and the quality assurance role of adoption panels at casework and systems level; and the recognition that adoption as an option is integral to the process of child care planning and practice. Those are some of the criteria, and perhaps attributes, of authorities that make it appropriate or useful for the taskforce to work with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked about scrutiny and partially answered the question by mentioning the annual report produced by the taskforce. It is available for everyone to see the progress that has been made, and at the end of its work with phase 1 authorities, the taskforce left questionnaires asking what the authorities felt that the taskforce had contributed. Those were returned and evaluated, and have informed the work of the taskforce in the second phase. They will also inform our work to evaluate how we can use the taskforce further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important point is that the taskforce is part of the Government's push to ensure that we get better practice in adoption and the promotion of permanence for children. I hope that Committee members will feel able to support the special grant report and that this opportunity to debate it will mean that when they read the taskforce's annual report, they will be pleased about their part in ensuring that it was financed this year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
