Draft Regulation of Investigatory Powers (Maintenance of Interception Capability) Order 2002</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Bob Ainsworth)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Regulation of Investigatory Powers (Maintenance of Interception Capability) Order 2002.</p></blockquote>
The draft order was laid before Parliament on 22 May, and was made in exercise of the powers conferred on the Secretary of State by section 12(1), (2) and (5), and by section 78(5) of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000.<br><br>
Part I, chapter I of that Act updates the previous United Kingdom law that governs the interception of communications. It provides for, and regulates, powers to allow lawful interception of communications by law enforcement, security and intelligence agencies, consistent with the Human Rights Act 1998. It also creates a system of safeguards that reflect the requirements of article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.<br><br>
In the UK, interception is conducted only under warrants authorised personally by the Secretary of State, and only where necessary in the interests of national security, preventing or detecting serious crime, or safeguarding the economic well-being of the UK. Safeguarding the economic well-being of the UK has been covered in guidance to avoid a wide interpretation of "economic well-being", but it amounts to a threat to the state equivalent to the item under "national security". Interception warrants are intelligence-gathering tools. The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act prohibits material derived from the warrants from being adduced as evidence in court. The UK's lawful interception regime is subject to oversight by the Interception of Communications Commissioner.<br><br>
Section 12 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act contains a provision whereby the Secretary of State may require a communications service provider to maintain an interception capability and meet obligations for which an order provides. The draft order aims to fulfil that function. Its schedule lists the obligations that the Secretary of State believes it is, and will be, reasonable and practicable to impose on communications service providers in order that they meet the requirements to provide assistance in relation to interception warrants. For the purpose of the draft order, interception of communications means the interception of a communication in the course of its transmission through a postal or telecommunications system. The obligations under part I of the schedule apply to communications
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
service providers who provide, or propose to provide, a public postal service. Subject to article 2(3) of the draft order, the obligations under part II of the schedule apply to communications service providers who provide, or propose to provide, a public telecommunications service.<br><br>
The draft order was the subject of a lengthy public consultation from December 2000 to August 2001, and of extensive dialogue between the Government and industry. The Office of Telecommunications was also consulted. The European Commission considered a copy of the draft order in accordance with the European transparency directive.<br><br>
I am pleased to announce that the Technical Advisory Board, known as TAB, has been established under the chairmanship of Mr. Liam Strong, who has considered and approved the draft order. TAB is a non-departmental public body provided for under section 13 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act. Apart from the chairman, it comprises six Government and six industry representatives. Under section 12(10), the draft order requires approval by a resolution of each House. If approved, the draft order will take effect from 1 August 2002.<br><br>
As set out in section 12(2), the power to impose obligations set out in the draft order shall be exercised by the giving of a notice, which requires a communications service provider subject to the obligation to take all such steps as may be specified or described, including those necessary to provide intercepted material to the relevant agencies, to maintain security and confidentiality and to facilitate and to carry out the functions of the Interception of Communications Commissioner. Under section 12(7), the CSP's duty to comply with the notice is enforceable in civil proceedings.<br><br>
The Government intend that a notice given to a CSP will, wherever possible, have been the product of prior dialogue and agreement between the Government's representatives and the relevant CSP. Should a CSP consider that a notice is unreasonable in respect of the steps it is required to take to meet its obligations or of the financial consequences of those steps, the CSP can refer the notice to TAB. In accordance with section 12(5), the draft order makes provision for such a referral to be made within 28 days.<br><br>
When a notice is referred, TAB will act as an independent assessor of its reasonableness and provide advice to the Secretary of State. After considering any report from TAB, the Secretary of State may either withdraw the notice or give further notice confirming its effect—with or without modifications.<br><br>
The Government recognise CSPs' concerns about costs resulting from the obligations in the draft order. Section 14(2) places a duty on the Secretary of State to ensure that arrangements are in force for securing that CSPs receive a fair contribution to the costs incurred as a consequence of both the imposition of the obligations in the draft order and the issue of interception warrants.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0123">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
Through the intercepting agencies, the Government presently have agreements in place with all CSPs currently providing interception and pay a substantial contribution to the costs. Last year, CSPs received in excess of £14 million from the Government. The money is largely intended to pay the costs of giving effect to interception warrants, but it is also used to assist with the maintenance of an interception capability.<br><br>
The Government intend to continue the existing arrangements until at least the end of this financial year, when they will seek to put in place a new regime that will more closely identify the costs arising from the issuing of warrants and from the maintenance of interception capability. Although the agencies will continue to contribute towards the former, the Home Office will contribute directly to the latter.<br><br>
To develop a new costing regime, the Government will require considerable assistance and transparency from the industry. Officials have begun to consult widely, and it is hoped that the new regime—based, as intended, on constructive and open dialogue between Government and the industry—will be fair and accepted by all sectors of the communications industry.<br><br>
In addition to continuing to make generous financial contributions to the CSPs that are already providing an interception capability, the Government will assist the CSPs that are required to establish a capability where one did not previously exist. During RIPA's passage through Parliament, £20 million was set aside over three financial years—2001–02, 2002–03 and 2003–04—primarily to assist with the costs of developing a capability for intercepting traffic transmitted as internet protocol. Government representatives at the National Technical Assistance Centre have been working with a number of CSPs to develop such a capability, and arrangements are being made to fund that work from the £20 million.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Norman Baker <span class='memberconstituency'>(Lewes)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I understood correctly, the Minister said in his interesting introduction that the Home Office would contribute annually to the maintenance of an interception capability for CSPs. Can he give an estimate of the annual cost to the taxpayer of supporting the maintenance of such a capability?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I just said that £20 million had been set aside over three financial years. To have proper sight of what costs what and to ensure that we are fair with the industry, we propose that the costs of issuing the warrants will continue to be paid by the agencies that apply for them. If a security agency or the National Crime Squad asks for a warrant, it will pay the costs of issuing it. That money has also effectively been subsidising the provision of a capability. In principle, therefore, the Home Office should pick up the costs of providing the capability, and the agencies should continue to pay for individual warrants.<br><br>
We must have the best sight that we can of what the costs are. As I hope I said, that is the purpose of the consultation that is taking place with the industry. We hope that the industry will be open with us, so that we can see exactly what the costs are of the capability that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
it is expected to provide, and so that we can ensure that the taxpayer is not paying unduly and perhaps also distorting the market. Equally, we must ensure that the CSP receives a fair contribution towards the costs being imposed on it of providing a capability. The desire is to separate the two issues: to leave the costs of issuing individual warrants to the agencies, and to pick up as a Home Office item the costs of providing in the first place, and maintaining, the capacity to make the intervention.</span></p>
<p>10.44 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dominic Grieve <span class='memberconstituency'>(Beaconsfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you, Mr. Amess, to the Chair. I also welcome the Minister's remarks. This is the first of a number of orders under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act that we must consider, and I suspect that it will be the least contentious. Others may be relatively uncontentious, but each must be considered on its merits.<br><br>
The draft order's objective is eminently sensible: RIPA contains a provision that places an obligation on service providers and the draft order defines it. It is probably sensible to say at this point that this is a mechanistic order that goes not to the issue of what should be intercepted, but to how it should be intercepted. The first test is whether the draft order is acceptable to the public service providers themselves. I believe, both from what the Minister has said and my own inquiries, that those in the industry who have had to liaise with the Government are satisfied with the Government's approach. However, there are perhaps a number of areas that we should examine and which he may be able to clarify.<br><br>
The figure of one in 10,000 is given for the interception capability. What is the total available number of lines in this country? The Minister may have to give us a rough guide rather than an exact figure, but it would be useful to know the maximum interception capability under the draft order. Although one in 10,000 appears to be a small figure, I suspect that the total number of lines operating in the United Kingdom in one form or another is extremely large.<br><br>
If the figure is substantial, I would be grateful if the Minister told us why that is thought necessary. Does it reflect the Government's view that, at any given moment, a huge number of interceptions will take place, or is there some other reason? My impression is that the number of interceptions that take place is not enormous, so I find a slight divergence between those two concepts. I would be grateful for his clarification.<br><br>
The Minister touched on internet capability. It is probably ignorance on my part, but internet capability is not identified separately in the schedule. One assumes that it is simply contained in the generality of the public telecommunications services that stand to be intercepted. Is no further reference needed or are there problems relating to the interception of internet traffic that differ from those involved with the interception of telephone conversations? We have heard about the problems posed by internet interception, particularly in the field of encryption, so it would be helpful to know how those issues
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0124">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
dovetail. Certainly, it was my understanding that the draft order covered that too.<br><br>
On a fair contribution to costs, I am pleased that discussions continue as to how those contributions will evolve. Clearly it would be desirable for hon. Members to know, through a statement, a letter or a question, how the Government have resolved that issue, because it is live. There should be a contribution to the costs of the public telecommunications services and others. After all, their job is not to intercept people's communications; any such work is done at the Government's request and for a reason. Will the Minister assure us that we shall be kept informed if any difficulty arises during discussions with the industry and about what has been resolved when those discussions conclude?<br><br>
I do not wish to take up too much of the Committee's time, but those are the key issues arising from the draft order. In a sense, it should be welcomed, as it is a good step to resolving satisfactorily the problem of how to undertake interception when it is needed. Subject to my points, the draft order seems to go a long way towards achieving that.</span></p>
<p>10.50 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Norman Baker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to see you in the Chair, Mr. Amess.<br><br>
The Minister started by referring to the three reasons why interception is permitted—national security, economic well-being and the third, which I have temporarily forgotten.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Serious crime.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Norman Baker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for prompting me.<br><br>
No one can dispute that it may be necessary to intercept communications, that those three categories are sensible or that a regime should set out when and how interception is permitted. To that extent, the proposals, which are mechanistic as the hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) said, are uncontroversial. However, like him, I am concerned about the one in 10,000 figure, which seems rather high.<br><br>
The Minister said that there was an extensive consultation over some months. That is true, and the Government appear to have listened to the representations and taken action accordingly, but the one in 10,000 figure was in the proposals that were put out for consultation and it appears unaltered in the schedule to the draft order, despite the fact that objections came from a range of providers, including e.centre, EURIM, Orange, Thus, UKERNA and others. They all thought the figure too high, while BT
<br><blockquote><p>"commented that an interception capability of 1 in 10,000 applied across all platforms would have an impact on service development and implementation."</p></blockquote>
The industry is clearly unhappy about the figure, so why has it not been altered to take account of those representations? As the hon. Member for Beaconsfield
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
said, the draft order appears to allow interception on a large scale.<br><br>
NTL was also concerned about the one in 10,000 figure and the requirement in paragraph 9 of part II of the schedule:
<br><blockquote><p>"To ensure filtering to provide only the traffic data associated with the warranted telecommunications identifier, where reasonable".</p></blockquote>
That was changed from "where feasible" in the consultation document, and NTL has said that it is concerned that it will be obliged to conduct—in its own words—mass surveillance operations. That is significant, so what is the Minister's response to that concern? No one wants such operations to be undertaken, as they would be disproportionate and could invoke data protection issues.<br><br>
The other main issue involves cost. In principle, it is right that the communications providers should not be out of pocket as a consequence of interception requirements placed on them by the Government, but it is equally right that taxpayers should not pay excessively for a service that they require from such bodies. Therefore, an independent and fair calculation must be made to assess the costs.<br><br>
The Minister said, rightly, that he will separate warrants and maintenance of capability, and a clear audit trail will show who is responsible for what. Nobody can dispute that, but as I understand what he said, there will, by definition, be an annual cost to the Home Office from the maintenance of interception capability, because that capability must be maintained. We should have been told its estimated cost to the taxpayer.<br><br>
A calculation must have been done, or has the Home Office simply adopted the principle that it will take action without costing it? If so, that is a peculiar way for the Government to proceed. If we are not careful, that could be a blank cheque for the communications industry were it so minded—I am sure it is not—to send unwarranted bills to the Government. I ask the Minister what audit procedure will ensure, first, that the communications industry is not unfairly out of pocket because of the requirements placed on it and, secondly, that the taxpayer is not ripped off by excess bills for the maintenance of capability being sent to the Home Office? The cost element must be sorted out.<br><br>
Lastly, the Minister mentioned the interception regime. What is the legal position in respect of the interception of communications by the United States authorities when that takes place on British soil such as Ministry of Defence land at RAF Menwith Hill and elsewhere? Does RIPA govern those activities, and does the one in 10,000 figure refer to that interception capability, too?</span></p>
<p>10.56 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I want to pick up on the comments made by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield. I say for the record that this is not the first order; at least one other order has gone through. I am racking my brains to remember whether there were two other orders. I certainly took one such measure through the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0125">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
House a week or two ago concerning the code of practice for the provision of a capability.<br><br>I would not want to say on the record that this was the first of a number of RIPA orders. The hon. Gentleman is probably right to say that there are others. There may be a confusing cross-referencing of some of the orders and the issues within them.<br><br>
As usual, the hon. Gentleman goes to the heart of an important issue in his request for information about the one in 10,000 figure. He asked for information about how many lines there are at present and whether the proposal is an indication of a desire for a substantial increase.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Cheryl Gillan <span class='memberconstituency'>(Chesham and Amersham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I may have misheard the Minister, so for the sake of clarification I ask him whether he said that another order went through Committee last week. If so, which order was it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give the hon. Lady the name of the order now but a RIPA order concerning the code of practice went through a similar Committee to this one. I shall make sure that my office provides the hon. Lady with details of that order so that she knows which one it is. If there was more than one, I shall ensure that she is aware of that, too.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would not want to embarrass the Minister or myself, and if he is wrong I shall forgive him for it. However, he needs to let hon. Members know. There are a number of orders on the Order Paper, several of which have not yet been committed to the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments, several of which have been committed to a statutory instrument Committee and one of which may be dealt with on the Floor of the House. As far as I was concerned, however, nothing had gone through in the last week or so, unless, of course, I missed it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is clearly in danger of embarrassing either herself or me. I suggest that I am likely to have a better record of having taken an order through than she will have of everything that goes through in Committee. It is far more likely that she is wrong than I am—unless I have had a vivid dream of a debate that took place in Committee Room 12, although I am not certain about that. I am certain that an order has gone through the House and I can provide the hon. Lady with the details.<br><br>
I turn to the substantial issue of the one in 10,000 capacity, why it is necessary and whether we envisage a substantial increase. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield asked about the current position. As ever, he goes to the heart of the issue. Presently, some 500 live intercepts are in existence at any one time. The hon. Gentleman will not be surprised to know that I questioned what seems at face value to be a large figure, but we do not envisage a massive increase in the number of interception warrants.<br><br>
These are individual warrants signed off by the Secretary of State. No change to procedures or to the people who have access to them is envisaged. Only the three reasons I supplied and the proportionality test are relevant in deciding the justifiability of the warrants. The industry wanted a figure of some
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
description. The Government position was to avoid any figure at all. The one in 10,000 figure arose because of the different sizes of companies and because exposure is not equally broad across the regions. Relatively small communications service providers are regionally based. An operation in a particular area could take up a proportion of intercept capacity at a particular time. We are unable to reduce the figure to fewer than one in 10,000 because of regional disparities, not because of the Government's desire massively to increase surveillance. None of the surveillance rules or authorisation procedures will be changed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Norman Baker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have been talking about the number of lines, but the Minister responded in terms of the number of warrants. Will he confirm that warrants can apply to more than one line and more than one person?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because of the nature of telecommunications, warrants, as I understand them—I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will appreciate this—apply to a named person, not a named line. They are signed off for a named person. If the hon. Gentleman were suspected of involvement in serious crime or deemed a serious risk to the state, a warrant would be issued for him, not for one of his telephone lines.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Norman Baker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I seriously hope that that would not be the case, not least because the Prime Minister gave me an assurance in a parliamentary answer that no Member of Parliament is subject to surveillance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: After what one of the hon. Members for Ealing said recently, the risk of that has diminished considerably.<br><br>
That is the position and I hope that I have provided an adequate explanation of why such an apparently large number is needed. As I said, the industry wanted a figure to be included, arguing that it would be infinitely exposed if no figure appeared. The Government did not want to set an unduly prescriptive figure. A particular operation might impact on a relatively small intercept service provider centred on a regional area.<br><br>
On internet and telephone differences, the interception of internet traffic is included in the interception of telecommunications in the draft order. However, the Government recognise that internet interception can be complicated. Encryption is important. The Government will draw on the expertise of the National Technical Assistance Centre. When fully operational, NTAC will provide the capability to produce plain text images and audio from lawfully intercepted communications and lawfully seized encrypted media. The purpose of NTAC is to provide usable information in a relatively complex area.<br><br>
The issue of parliamentary information on how much the negotiations will cost was central to some of the comments of the hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker), who said that we were in danger of issuing a blank cheque. We will not be able to get at the actual costs without the assistance of the industry, so detailed discussion and understanding will be necessary; the

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
costs of maintaining such a provision will have to be demonstrated to us and we will have to satisfy ourselves that they are justified. If we do not get that right, taxpayers will be ripped off, one internet service provider could be given a subsidy that is not available to another, or we will impose a requirement that is in no way fairly recompensed.<br><br>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts and understands that we have no desire to issue a blank cheque but that detailed discussion, disclosure and transparency are necessary if we are to be fair and to win the confidence of the industry. We must reassure it that we seek not to rip it off but to know its costs in order to be fair to both it and the taxpayer. I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that that needs to be clear. If we hang a figure on the measure, we will invite people to aim at that target, even if just to complain that it is not high enough or to ensure that it is fully justified in any discussions with us. However, it is reasonable—to pick up the point of the hon. Member for Beaconsfield—to ensure that during the discussions we are transparent with Parliament. We undertake to find mechanisms for doing so. People will not be slow in coming forward if they are not satisfied with the state of those discussions. We must be able to update Parliament on our progress and on any problems unearthed as a result of attempts to get to the bottom of the costs.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Lewes referred to the view of NTL that the issue is one of mass surveillance. As I understand it, NTL was complaining about the changing of "feasible" to "reasonable". I am not the best person to explain the precise meaning of every word in the "Oxford English Dictionary" but I do not know how NTL came to the conclusion that changing "feasible" to "reasonable" invites mass surveillance. "Reasonable" is a word that can be tested in law; "feasible" is a far more technical term. I am sorry that we upset NTL by that change but I hope that I have reassured the hon. Gentleman that there is no intention or desire—or, indeed, legal framework—to allow mass surveillance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Norman Baker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister, and I am sure that everyone welcomes that last assurance. I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
am sorry if I did not make myself clear. The original word in the consultation was "feasible". NTL objected to the concept of filtering to identify the telecommunications of a particular warranted telecommunications provider, where feasible. The word "feasible" was subsequently changed to "reasonable", but I am not clear whether that change meets NTL's concerns. I understand that its objection was to the whole concept, not to that particular adjective.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It might be wise to write to the hon. Gentleman on that point rather than to try to go into it now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman might be about to help me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Grieve</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I am trying to help the Minister. The change to the word "reasonable" is likely to have been a concession in the direction of NTL. If the word were "feasible", however unreasonable it might be to demand interception, it could still be demanded provided that it was technically feasible to achieve it. The word "reasonable" usually implies some marriage between time and cost against the goal that is likely to be achieved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That seems logical to me. If that is not the case, I will write to the hon. Members for Lewes and for Beaconsfield to ensure that they are provided with a proper explanation as to what happened, if the hon. Member for Beaconsfield has not already found it for us.<br><br>
I do not have anything to say to the hon. Member for Lewes on Menwith Hill and the US capability. I will therefore write to him and try to cover the points that he raised.</span></p>
