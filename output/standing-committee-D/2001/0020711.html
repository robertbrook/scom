	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On this very pleasant July summer afternoon I welcome all members to the Committee. Is it the wish of the Committee that the orders be debated together? [HON. MEMBERS: Yes.] I gather that it is, and I am grateful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Pound 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ealing, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether this is a point of order, Sir Nicholas, but will you rule on whether members may remove their jackets, in view of the warmth of the July afternoon to which you have alluded?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Simon Hughes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Southwark, North and Bermondsey)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Two.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Two members. If members feel more comfortable removing their jackets, I am happy for them to do so. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Ealing, North (Mr. Pound) for doing me the courtesy of asking my permission so to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Taylor 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Solihull)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Nicholas, I should like your permission to keep on not only my jacket, but my waistcoat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We will clearly have a most enjoyable afternoon. The hon. Gentleman is known for his independence and style, and he has shown it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Citizenship and Immigration (Beverley Hughes)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Local Government Finance (England) Special Grant Report (No. 92)(HC 877) on Special Grants for Asylum Seekers Support (Adults and Families of Asylum Seekers) for 1999–2000.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the Local Government Finance (England) Special Grant Report (No. 99)(HC 878) on Special Grants for Unaccompanied Asylum-Seeking Children for 2002–03.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to be in Committee with you this afternoon, Sir Nicholas. It looks as though we will have a lively and enjoyable debate. Special grant report No. 55, which was processed in March 2000, gave permission to pay £185 million to local authorities for their claims for support of asylum-seeking adults and families. To date, £186 million has been paid and final audited claims amount to £192 million. The conditions of the special grant prescribe that if the £185 million ceiling is exceeded, each authority's claim should be reduced. Local authorities were promised by the then Secretary of State that claims would be met in full.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of today's debate is to approve the payment of an additional £6 million. I am sure that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
Parliament would not want to maintain its original voted intention if it were aware that that amount had to be absorbed by local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Cheryl Gillan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chesham and Amersham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may have misheard, but I thought that the Minister just said that the figure for the final number of claims submitted is £192 million, and the ceiling is £185 million. Does that not mean that there is a gap of £7 million and not, as she said, £6 million?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady did not mishear. However, perhaps she did not hear me say that £186 million had already been paid, which is somewhat more than the £185 million figure. The difference therefore between £192 million and £186 million is £6 million, which is the amount that we are debating today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister telling the Committee that, as the ceiling was £185 million, an unauthorised £1 million has already been paid over to authorities? Where did the authorisation for that extra £1 million come from?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some £1 million more than the £185 million has been paid. I cannot give the hon. Lady a detailed answer to her question, but will endeavour to do so during the debate. I suspect that as regards paying the full amount that local authorities have specified, the extra £1 million was probably the result of paying—[	<i>Interruption</i>.] I am trying to explain the mathematical consequence of the way in which the bills were paid that could have resulted in aggregate overpayments to meet local authorities' claims. Clearly, payments could not go far beyond £185 million without us having to return to Committee, as we have done today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric Forth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bromley and Chislehurst)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For clarification, can the Minister tell the Committee exactly which period we are referring to? Different periods are referred to in the tour de force that is in front of us, so it would help the Committee's deliberations to put things in context by knowing whether we are authorising expenditure that has been incurred in the past, is being incurred now or will be incurred in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are dealing with the period from 1 April 1999 to 5 December 1999. If the right hon. Gentleman waits a little longer, I shall explain why we are dealing with that period and the reason for the overpayments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the time of the report that allocated £185 million, the then Secretary of State said that the Government had made available up to £185 million—an increase of £10 million—to ensure that claims for the period could be met in full. They clearly could not be met in full, which is why we are back here. Why was the revised Government estimate, after they received notice that local authorities were short of money, again inadequate? Why have we had to come back for a second time to authorise another upwardly revised figure when the Government were clearly given figures by local authorities and were told that there was not enough money?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0219">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government were not told at the time that further money would be required by local authorities. We have been told that since. In the process of auditing accounts and considering matters in detail, we have found that that extra money is required. If the hon. Gentleman waits a little longer, and allows me to progress with my speech, I should be able satisfactorily to address the question that he raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Outstanding amounts have clearly been promised to local authorities, which is why the second special grant report for that period is required. Amounts payable to individual authorities are subject to maximum weekly costs of £140 for adults and £240 for families, as prescribed by the special grant report No. 55, less any amounts already paid. Authorities are not required to complete a claim form, as amounts payable will be calculated as the difference between audited claims and amounts already paid to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Initial claims amounted to £182 million and as a result, the special grant report was set at that time at a higher figure of £185 million. The audit certificate from Haringey amounted to £9.8 million when it was finally completed, against its initial claim of £4.4 million, which had been used to reach the amount contained in the original special grant report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to finish this point, so that Members are completely clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In March 2001, we paid £4 million to Haringey; it argued that if scaling were applied to the £185 million, that is what it would be entitled to. It was that payment that brought total payments to £186 million. The Comptroller and Auditor General drew attention to the fact that payments had breached the £185 million limit in his report on the Home Office accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The delay in reaching this point and processing the total required for this additional special grant report was due to a request from Northamptonshire for more time while it investigated a potential fraud. That situation was not finalised until April this year, when a revised audit certificate was issued for that authority. Clearly, the Home Office depends on audited claims and as they are inevitably received late, special grant limits may have to be revised, as has been the case in this instance, for the reasons that I have outlined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am rather alarmed if I have understood correctly what the Minister said about Haringey and the fact that she relies on audited reports. How on earth could any local authority make a mistake of the proportion of a figure of £4.4 million compared to £9.8 million? That is not just double the first amount, but double it plus £1 million; that is for one single local authority. Can the Minister give us further details on whether that happened through incompetent auditing, incompetent accounting or even fraud? It seems an alarming discrepancy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot comment on why Haringey's initial claim of £4.4 million turned out to be so out of kilter with its ultimate actual expenditure. Members may know of some of the difficulties
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
concerning finances and the control of finances that that local authority faced during that period, which have been in the public domain. I am not sure whether that was the reason. The hon. Lady will be aware, I am sure that, in finalising claims and settling final amounts paid to local authorities under special grant reports—the paying out of public money—the Home Office, like any Government Department, cannot finally resolve payments until it has gone through the process of satisfying itself on the basis of audited claims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of the discrepancy is a matter for Haringey. We are satisfied that the £9.8 million that came through the audited process is the right figure because it has been through that process. Due to the difference between the initial claim or estimate and the final figure, there is clearly a need—if we are to keep our commitments to local authorities—for us to pay the additional money. As I said, the other case involved Northamptonshire, which was investigating a fraud. That process finished, and the audited claims were finalised, only two months ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This gets more alarming the more we hear of it. Can the Minister tell us what will happen if the Committee decides not to grant the money? Frankly, the more I hear about it, the more I want the Committee to do that, although I am not a voting member. To say at this stage that it is a matter for Haringey and not us is rather bizarre, as we are the ones being asked to pay the money. Surely we have the option of whether or not to pay it, depending on whether we are satisfied by what the Minister says. Can she help us by saying what might happen should we decide at this stage not to pay the money, perhaps subject to receiving further information?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the right hon. Gentleman knows the answer to that question. In coming to the Committee with the report after audited accounts have satisfied the authorities, we are satisfied that Haringey has paid £9.8 million to asylum-seeking adults and families. Therefore, if the additional money sought today were not forthcoming, we would have to revert to the scaling down provided for in the previous special grant report, which would affect all local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is whether we are satisfied that Haringey has paid the amount of money in question. That has been through due process, and we are satisfied. It has spent the money on asylum-seeking adults and families, and the commitment of Parliament was to reimburse local authorities for that expenditure. The Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 clearly gave the Home Office the power to reimburse local authorities for costs incurred in supporting asylum-seeking adults and families. Since 6 December—the last date that the grant report pertains to—we do not need a special grant report to do that, so the expenditure has come through differently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Paice 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South-East Cambridgeshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to press the Minister on the point about Haringey. It is all very well for her to say that the Government have audited the figures and to state that the figure claimed is correct. The fact is that Haringey furnished the Government with wholly inadequate figures in the first place. I ask her to reconsider the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0220">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
suggestion that that is Haringey's responsibility. The Government are now in the embarrassing position of coming to the Committee this afternoon to ask for more money, solely because—with the exception of the small amount in Northamptonshire—of the inadequacy of Haringey's internal arrangements. What action have the Government taken over Haringey council's failure to be able properly to "advise the Government about the figures that were going to be questioned? Has the Minister asked the district auditor to examine Haringey's internal auditing systems? How could the Government be so seriously misled about, as my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) said, an amount that is more than 50 per cent. of the accurate figure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is raising issues that may be important, but they are not a matter for me in my ministerial role. They belong to a different Minister in a different Department. As to the effectiveness and probity with which local authorities audit their accounts and manage their expenditure, it is public knowledge that Haringey council went through a period of difficulties and that these were dealt with very effectively by the then Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions. I can assure the Committee that the sum spent by Haringey that we finally accepted has been subject to independent audit by the district auditor in the normal way. That is why, if we are to maintain our commitment to reimburse authorities for expenditure on supporting asylum-seeking adults and families, we have to come back to the Committee to ensure that we have authorisation for the finances to pay the outstanding authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Mole Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst asked what would happen if the Committee declined to provide the funds. The Minister replied that matters would revert to what they were before, and that therefore funds would be taken away from all local authorities. Surely they would be taken away from one local authority—perhaps Northamptonshire as well— but not all of them, or is she tarring them all with the Haringey brush?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not tarring any authority with any brush. I am explaining, as I think that the hon. Gentleman knows, the provisions that were in the original special grant report. If the claims from local authorities exceed the total amount that the Committee awards under the special grant arrangement, there is a formula for scaling down for all local authorities so the ceiling is not breached. If the ceiling were not extended today, that would have an impact on every local authority through that scaling-down process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is most gracious in giving way so generously. I hope that she understands that there is a certain amount of alarm among Opposition Members. I am sure that there may be a small amount of alarm among Government Members as well, though they keep it well hidden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
I am very worried about the chain of accountability. If I understood the Minister correctly, if Haringey gets its figures wrong by £5.4 million, it is a matter for Haringey. The fact that its figures are wrong does not mean that it is subject to castigation or penalty of any description; that is the responsibility of another Minister. However, the Home Office picks up the bill. Where is the accountability? There is no direct link to the local authority that has committed the "crime" and we have no guarantee that it will not happen again, or that the authority is being audited correctly. We do not know what caused the problem in the first place or whether there was an element of fraud. I cannot understand how we can make the link or how we can possibly scrutinise such expenditure satisfactorily.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady raises several points that I have already addressed. I have assured her and Opposition Members that the final sum— albeit that it was more than Haringey's original estimate—was audited in the normal way, independently, by the district auditor. There is no question of Haringey spending any of the £9.8 million on anything other than the proper purpose of supporting asylum-seeking adults and families.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Lady is saying that an individual authority should be penalised if its original estimate is lower than the actual expenditure, she will fail to fulfil the promise of Parliament, made at the time of the special grant report No. 55, that the expenditure would be met in full. I am sure that—unlike for her and, perhaps, her colleagues—the most important priority for Government Members is that money that is spent by local authorities in supporting adults and children of families who are seeking asylum will be reimbursed in full by the Government. That is what the debate on this special grant report is about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Haringey's final figure has been validated through all the normal processes. The hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham must accept that that is what it spent. If she accepts that, and if she wants to maintain the commitment that we gave to local authorities, she must accept that we must reimburse the additional amounts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no way of checking the amount that Haringey spent. Of course, if the audited accounts are up to scratch, I acknowledge that that must be the case. However, there must have been a system failure and someone must have been responsible for so grossly underestimating the amount, given the magnitude of the difference between the actual expenditure and the budgeted amount. Can the Minister assure us that this will not happen again? What internal disciplinary action has been taken by the council?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady well knows that those matters are not for me or for the Committee. We must be assured that the amounts to be reimbursed are proper, that they have been audited properly and that the money has been spent on the purpose for which it was intended. It is not for us, as Members, to check the figures. We cannot do that; we must rely on proper systems. In this instance, the proper systems have been mobilised through the auditing procedure. The money has been spent on the purpose for which it was

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
intended and, in accordance with the agreed principles, the amount must be paid to Haringey.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there no other comments about that special grant report, I shall speak about special grant report No. 99.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the Minister is moving on so quickly. She said very briefly that Northamptonshire was a fraud investigation. Will she clarify that and tell us whether there was a fraud, how much money was involved and what the difference was between the original claim and the current claim?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the Minister replies, I should like to help the Committee. Our debate relates to the two reports that we are discussing together, which set out the determination that the Home Secretary has made concerning special grants to be paid to certain local authorities. Those grants are in support of local authorities' expenditure in connection with their legal obligations to provide accommodation and services for two categories of people; asylum-seeking adults and their families between 1 April and 5 December 1999, which is covered by report No. 92, and unaccompanied asylum-seeking children between 1 April 2002 and the day before the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill is passed, which is covered by report No. 99, which I believe the Minister may be coming to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate should focus on the determination of the Home Secretary rather than seek to ascertain from the Minister matters which I, from the Chair, believe lie rightly with another Department. I hope that hon. Members will direct their attention to the reports relating to the determination of the Home Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Nicholas. Would you clarify for the Committee precisely what you have just said? That is not intended to sound impertinent, but we are being asked this afternoon to approve a report that will allow £6 million of public money to be spent. Is it in order to ask the Government why, and not just how, that money will be spent? If that is in order, is it also in order to ask why the figure in a previous report, which has been supplemented by the report before us, was incorrect? There seems to be a link. The Government produced an order some times ago and provided a figure, which the Committee at that time approved. However, the Government have returned today, saying, "Sorry, we got that wrong. This is a different figure and it is £6 million higher." Is it not in order to ask why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I advise the Committee and the hon. Gentleman, who has raised a reasonable point of order, that the Committee is here to consider the two reports and the determination that has been made by the Home Secretary. Ultimately, it will be for the House, not the Committee, to approve expenditure. I believe that some of the matters that have been raised are legitimate, but I do not want the debate to go wide of the purpose of the Committee this afternoon and to ask questions of the Minister who, for very good reason, is not competent to deal with all those matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the Minister advised the Committee that matters relating to extra expenditure have been properly audited and I hope that that will be accepted by the Committee. I am here only to rule on how the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
Committee should proceed. I shall not protect the Opposition or the Government, but I do not want the whole debate to be directed at matters for which the Minister does not have responsibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir Nicholas. I hope that you agree that Ministers have collective responsibility and that it is proper for any Minister who has been made a member of the Committee by the Government to answer properly any questions that are in order. I am sure that you will verify that that is so. I simply refer you to paragraph 2 of report No. 92, which clearly states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This report specifies the Secretary of State's determination",</p></blockquote>
and you kindly guided us on that point. However, it goes on to refer to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the purposes for which the grants are to be paid and the manner in which the amounts of the grants are to be calculated … the conditions which the Secretary of State intends to impose on the payment of the grant to which this Report relates."</p></blockquote>
That appears to give proper scope and proper authorisation for the questions that my hon. Friends have raised. I hope that you agree that it appears to give us fairly wide scope to question the Minister on these matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I say to the right hon. Gentleman that I have allowed fairly wide scope in the debate so far, and I shall continue to use my discretion. The Minister has stated, however, that an independent body properly audited the sums spent, which leads me to believe that they have been correctly spent in accordance with the legislation, although I know that the right hon. Gentleman has an expert way of questioning almost anything. I am happy for the debate to continue, and I merely ask the Committee to direct its major focus towards its purpose this afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Nicholas. I seek your guidance because, like my hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley (Sir P. Beresford), I want a little more detail from the Minister about the Northamptonshire fraud investigation. Fraud is a Home Office matter, and presumably it would be in order for me to question a Home Office Minister about a fraud that is relevant to this grant. I seek your guidance and your confirmation that I am correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Fraud is certainly a criminal offence, and responsibility for dealing with it no doubt lies in part with the Home Office. The Minister has clearly heard these points of order, and I am sure that she will do her best to respond to the questions that have been raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you very much, Sir Nicholas. I am grateful for your clarification and for your endorsement of the points that I have made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pound</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister moves on, I should tell her that, on reading the reports and the other information, those who represent most London constituencies will say, "There but for the grace of God go I." The asylum support system was so chaotic until the disciplines and protocols introduced by her Department, particularly since 1999, that it is amazing that the problems were not more widespread. The new atmosphere of discipline that exists in Haringey and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0222">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
other London boroughs augurs extremely well for the future, and the Minister and her Department should take credit for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful to my hon. Friend for that important insight into London boroughs. They support large numbers of asylum-seeking adults and families and they do their very best in difficult circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me take up Opposition Members' point about Northamptonshire. To reiterate my earlier comments, which you so kindly repeated, Sir Nicholas, we would not be bringing a request for further money for the local authority unless the amount had been properly audited. Clearly, no fraud was found and the issue was resolved satisfactorily. The auditors confirmed that the expenditure in total was appropriate and met the conditions referred to in paragraph 2 of special grant report No. 92. They also confirmed that it was properly spent and, therefore, that we might properly reimburse it today.
On special grant report No. 99, hon. Members may be aware that there is a significant and, unfortunately, growing number of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children being cared for by local authorities. The number now stands at more than £6,500—[	<i>Interruption</i>.] I apologise; 6,500 such children. At present about 58,000 children are looked after by local authorities in England and although the figure of 6,500 unaccompanied asylum-seeking children might seem relatively small, some authorities have very significant numbers of such children in their care. Members may be aware of the situation in Kent, where the number of such children for whom the local authority is responsible is almost the same as the size of their own looked-after child population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It falls to local authority social services departments to care for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children in the same way as they would care for any other child in need. Although the Home Office is responsible for providing the funding to those local authorities, the Department of Health continues to have the policy responsibility for the children, as they do for all children who come within the scope of the Children Act 1989 and the Children (Leaving Care) Act 2000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We acknowledge that the increasing numbers of unaccompanied children are putting additional pressure on some local authorities. The purpose of this debate is to discuss the funding that we are providing through central Government to help local authorities to meet the costs incurred in the current financial year. There have been special grant arrangements to help local authorities to meet the costs of providing support to these children for a number of years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill contains provision for the Home Office to fund unaccompanied asylum-seeking children without the need for a special grant report. Consequently, this year's grant report—as I am sure members, observant as they are, will have noticed—covers the period up to the date of Royal Assent to that Bill. As that date is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
not yet known, it is impossible to estimate an overall ceiling to the funding, as we have done in previous years. We have therefore removed the ceiling for this period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This year's rates for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children were agreed at the beginning of the year to enable local authorities to budget for the cost of caring for them. In recognition of the cash flow pressures put on local authorities, the arrangement of the settlement of the grant has been amended to provide for quarterly payments, commencing on 31 July this year, if the House agrees to this report. That takes account of a point made during last year's debate about the problems caused by making the payments at the end of the financial year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Minister just said that the Government find it impossible to get sufficient grip on the numbers to provide a meaningful ceiling. We are therefore being asked to approve what sounds suspiciously like a blank cheque. However, in the next breath, she went on to talk about the local authorities involved budgeting for this expenditure. If the Government, in all their majesty, cannot work out a ceiling, how can they reasonably expect the local authorities to work out a reliable budget?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman was listening carefully to what I was saying, but he has not understood it. The issue is not that we cannot reasonably estimate numbers and have a grip on them but that we do not know when the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill will receive Royal Assent. We are unsure not of the numbers but of the precise period of time that this grant will have to cover. That is why we have taken the ceiling away. Doing so enables us to pay local authorities in full for whatever period ensures without coming back to the Committee. We estimate that reimbursements to local authorities this year will amount to about £140 million, which compares with £111 million, £85 million, £50 million and £20 million in the previous four years respectively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister is not about to move off the figures, because I want to probe a little on them in relation to report No. 99.1 want to ask about paragraph 3(2)(a), (b) and (c) and paragraph 3(3)(a), (b) and (c) of annex A, which contain differentials between the over-16s, the people covered by section 20(1) of the Children Act 1989 and the under-16s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The differential for exceeding the weekly total of 100 or fewer children in the relevant period is listed for the over-16s as four fifteenths in the uplift. However, for section 20(1) people and the under-16s, there appears to be a differential of eighty-four one hundred and fifteenths. What is the difference between the two? Why is the differential not the same? I do not understand why the uplift should be so remarkably different in those instances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Lady bears with me, I shall come to that point and explain the figures in the report. I shall explain the differentials between them, among other matters. She could listen to what I said and then decide whether she wanted to ask further questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0223">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
About 80 per cent. of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children are 16 or 17 years old. For those young people, we are meeting local authorities' costs up to £220 a week. The care costs for children under 16 are usually much greater, so for them we are meeting claims of up to £420 a week. That is one differential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some authorities with responsibility for higher numbers of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children also encounter costs that are significantly higher than allowed for under the grant. To enable local authorities with the largest numbers of children to meet the costs, higher rates are available. For local authorities that, on average, looked after 100 or more children aged 16 and 17 each week, we are meeting costs of up to £300 a week. For children under 16, the higher rate is up to £575 a week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The differentials in those numbers and between those grades are the exact subject that I asked about. There is inconsistency between the uplift on the grade A band, to use the vernacular, and the B and C bands. Also, I would have expected an economy of scale, with lower costs for larger numbers. I do not understand how there can be such excessive costs for larger numbers. In most other matters, larger numbers often mean that savings can be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We recognise the fact that, in the previous year, the uplift was based on the figures for the authorities that cared for larger numbers of children. There is no particular uplift for the authorities that cared for smaller numbers, but this year we are increasing the figure for those authorities in recognition of that fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not agree with the hon. Lady on economies of scale; we are not talking about tins of beans, but about children with specific needs. Although there may be some potential for economies of scale in terms of overheads, the additional costs to local authorities in caring for large numbers of children rise significantly. The placement and infrastructure costs must relate to each child. We cannot always simply bunch a group of children with a social worker, because they may all need a social worker. Therefore, we cannot always achieve the economies of scale that might be met if we were not dealing with needy children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This was an area on which I intended to question the Minister in my speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sorry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not at all; my hon. Friend was right to raise it. The Minister is fumbling for an explanation. As my hon. Friend said, her figures show a difference of £80 per person per week between the amounts paid, depending on the numbers involved. If a local authority has charge of 100 youngsters over 16, the payment is £220, but it rises to £300 if there are 101 youngsters. I do not understand how the Government can explain that extra £80 per person, so I hope that the Minister will have another go at explaining it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend made a point about economies of scale. I cannot see why crossing a threshold of 100 should make such a dramatic difference to the cost. If the difference had been something like 5 per cent., we might have understood it, but £80 added to £220 is a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
huge leap. I do not understand the principle of a threshold of 100 and why there is such a quantum leap in payment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The threshold of 100 does not represent a fine line between the potential distributions of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children. In other words, I cannot tell the hon. Gentleman that there will be an authority with 100 children and another authority that has 101. My understanding is that authorities will either be well under or well over the figure. [	<i>Interruption</i>.] It is a valid point. I do not think that the argument about economies of scale apply if an authority is catering for a lot more than 100 children. In fact, the reverse is true. The logistics and demands will be complex and significant when placing very large numbers of 16 and 17-year-old people in an area with finite resources in terms of suitable accommodation; all areas will be in that situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities such as Kent—representatives of which I met this week—would be able to tell the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice) that the unit costs for children under and over 16 are close to the actual costs when large numbers of children are being cared for. That is another point that he needs to be aware of. Local authorities will receive the lower figure; either the unit cost multiplied by the number of children in their care or the figure that they have actually spent. Some authorities spend somewhat less than others and make lower claims and, if that is the case, that is the amount that they are paid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pound</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to resist the temptation to be London-centric—[	<i>Interruption</i>.] If there is no such word, I withdraw it. I assure the Minister that she is absolutely right and that it is completely spurious to raise any argument about economies of scale in the context of finite housing and education. If we looked for economies of scale, we would be talking about asylum concentration centres outside London. That idea may be discussed in another place. Would that any borough in London had less than 100 such children. The Minister is right to say that there are either far less or far more than 100.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall make two further points about the issues raised by Opposition Members. First, we recognise that the arrangements outlined in the report are not ideal, which is why we are changing the arrangements in the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill that is passing through Parliament. It is sometimes difficult to assess how many children there are and how much it costs to look after them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the best system that we have at the moment. It is a continuation of what has existed in previous years, but it is ending. The proposed figures are our best estimate, working with local authorities, of the costs that have to be met by local authorities caring for children in different age groups, and for different numbers of children. There is some flexibility, even within that arrangement, to address the issues that local authorities face. If they make a claim and are reimbursed in relation to the formula, they can offset spending in one area against spending in another, so long as they meet the overall criteria in relation to the sum that they have asked for across the board in relation to all the groups of children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0224">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am still not entirely clear; I would appreciate the Minister's clarification of one point about the finances. Despite her assurance and that of the hon. Member for Ealing, North (Mr. Pound) that nobody ever gets close to the 100 barrier, if I were a local authority with 100 children in my care, I would be paid £220 a week if they were all over 16. If I suddenly found myself with 101, I would receive £300 a week for each of them. I therefore would have an incentive to exceed 100 in order to increase the payment for all of the children. Would she clarify that point?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point is that we are dealing with humans; unaccompanied children. How can we say with any certainty what those children's ages will be? According to the way in which the documents are drafted, when we suddenly find out that we think that they are 16, hey presto, overnight we drop the amount by £275 a week. That aspect of the statutory instrument is callous and difficult to deal with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before I call on the Minister to reply, I point out interventions are getting a little long. I have to advise the Committee that the Minister has now been speaking for some 50 minutes and that the debate must conclude at 6 o'clock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Chairman. Would it be in order, in the light of the discussion, for us to reconsider whether we could have the two—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The answer to that is no.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In relation to the first point of the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham, I do not believe that any local authority would be so irresponsible as to do what she was suggesting—or what we could be forgiven for thinking she was suggesting—and, because of a differential in the unit cost being proposed under the special grant report, go around touting for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children in order to get another £80 a head— [	<i>Interruption</i>.] £80 was the example cited for 16 to 17-year-olds. It is sometimes difficult to establish the age of an asylum-seeking child, or even whether he or she is a minor. Local authorities have established procedures to go through in that regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are discussing is not directly age— although it comes down to what we think is a child's age—but the level of care under the Children Act 1989 that each child receives. Much larger costs are involved in the care of a fully looked after child accommodated by the local authority under section 20 than in the provision of accommodation and a lower level of support for older young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have acknowledged that although the amounts have covered local authorities' costs, the arrangements for reaching a conclusion on the amount of grant for any local authority are not ideal. There are also significant problems for some local authorities in trying to find suitable placements for the large numbers of children in their care, so we have set up a joint working committee, with representatives of local authorities, to review whether the current arrangements are the best means of supporting such highly vulnerable children. We may decide that the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
current model offers the best means of meeting our obligations, but we are also exploring alternative models through which local government can continue to provide support. The review is due to conclude in the autumn, with a view to implementing recommendations when the Bill receives royal assent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order to allow other hon. Members to contribute to the debate, I shall now conclude my remarks on the special grant report, which, I understand, Sir Nicholas, I will move formally later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, there will be two decisions to be made by the Committee, which will be reached separately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.26 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel like a bit-player in this afternoon's performance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to start with the special grant report No. 92, with which the Minister also dealt first. We entirely understand the principle behind the report and have no intention of opposing the idea of reimbursing local authorities for their expenditure in supporting asylum seekers, which is perfectly right. It puts right the problems that arose from special grant report No. 55 as a result of the scaling down arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel that the Minister was rather cursory in her dismissal of the problems that arose in Haringey. Of course we understand the history behind what happened and what took place, but the fact is that it must have caused her some embarrassment to have to come back to the House for more money, largely because of incompetence in Haringey. I would expect her to have some regret about that, as well as an understanding of what actions may have been taken by other Departments to ensure that it does not happen again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to take the Minister on a stage because the report is based on the sum of £140 per week per adult and £240 for a family. I should like the Minister to compare those figures with the answers that her Department gave recently about the cost of keeping asylum seekers at Oakington, where the cost is £1,620 a week. Oakington used to be in my constituency, so I know the facilities reasonably well. I readily accept that there would be extra costs there, which would not be met by a local authority, but the difference seems to be dramatic. Can the Minister explain a little further why there is such a dramatic difference in the figures, between £140 for a single adult via a local authority and £1,620 when that adult is housed at Oakington, bearing in mind that that does not include the cost of any of the legal processes or other associated costs?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister then take that matter another step forward and compare the figures to whatever budgeted figures the Government have for the new arrangements in the accommodation centres that are to be introduced through the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill, to which the reports refer? The House has a right, via this Committee, to know the comparisons between the figures, how the Government explain the vast differences and what the actual cost per adult will be of the new accommodation centres—the running costs, let alone the huge capital costs.

I turn to special grant report No. 99, which deals with children. We on this side fully understand the situation in Kent. For obvious reasons, we have very good relations and contacts with its local authority and understand the costs. We are not disputing the fact that Kent's costs are huge. I think that the Minister either intentionally or unintentionally slightly misunderstood the points that my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham and I raised on that matter. The issue is not whether the figures are justifiable, but why there should be such a huge difference per capita between an authority with a large number of unaccompanied children and one with a very small number. They all need the costs of accommodation, either brought in or provided; they all need a share of a social worker, with the administrative costs that go with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I still do not understand why there is that huge differential. It is not that we do not understand that vast costs are involved or that we think that the £220 or £300 or £575 or any particular figure is right or wrong. We are simply trying to understand why the Government believe there is such a huge differentiation. It might be helpful, in trying to explain the differences in the figures, if the Minister could quote some actual figures, comparing, say, the actual cost per child in Kent or one of the London boroughs with that in an authority that has much lower numbers to cope with, such as mine in Cambridgeshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was very pleased that the Minister referred to a move to quarterly payments. I was going to ask what consideration she had given to giving some money to local authorities in advance rather than at the end of the year. Quarterly payments will make a significant difference to cash flow, so are to be welcomed. I suggest that in the case of authorities with very large numbers, she look further at what more can be done to help with their cashflow problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I have a question about annex B, paragraph 3, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The grant does not include payments in respect of persons who have no legal right to remain in the country, after their claim for asylum has been finally determined or abandoned."</p></blockquote>
I know that you will quickly rule me out of order, Sir Nicholas, and justifiably, if I embark on the Government's overall immigration and asylum policy. However, from figures that the Government have openly published, we know that the number of removals of people whose asylum applications have been completed and rejected is extremely low. I do not have the precise figure for removals of children to hand, but who is paying for children who, in the words of the report,
	<br><blockquote><p>"have no legal right to remain in the country"?</p></blockquote>
Is that purely down to the local authority and, therefore, effectively, to the council taxpayer in that authority? If it is, it seems somewhat unjust that the Home Office is responsible for removals and dealing with people whose applications and appeals have been properly processed and rejected. The Government are acting, but local authorities are paying the bill. It is a genuine issue of concern and I hope that the Minister can explain the answer. I do not know what the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
Government do with a child whose application is rejected. Something has to be done, but who is picking up the bill, where is the child going and what happens to them? There is clearly an anomaly in annex B of the report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no intention of dividing the Committee, despite the comments from my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth) because both reports are obviously a sensible way to correct serious errors, which the Minister has belittled, and properly pay local authorities for the care of children until the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill has passed into law when, as she rightly says, a new arrangement will be made. I have posed a number of genuine questions to the Minister and I hope that she will be able to answer them in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Simon Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I congratulate you, Sir Nicholas, on your knighthood, which has happened since you were last in the Chair of a Committee of which I was a member. I shall be brief, not least because I am meant to be both on the Front Bench in the House dealing with the intelligence debate and elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a veteran of some of the earlier debates on the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill, in which this matter came up, and of debates in Standing Committee dealing with previous grant orders. I shall make the general view of me and my hon. Friend the Member for Colchester (Bob Russell) clear. We will not vote against the reports because local authorities should be compensated properly for money that they have spent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire made it clear that it is wrong that local authorities should always be paid in arrears. I have made the point before in Committee during the proceedings of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill to the Minister's predecessor, the hon. Member for Wallasey (Angela Eagle), that there should be payment up front and money should be paid quarterly. The Government indicated that they accepted the logic of that case because local authorities should not always be in arrears and in deficit in dealing with what is clearly a costly obligation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to the first report, it is difficult for the Government to argue that they were not warned that the bill would be higher than the sum of money that they sought, and there were two reasons for that. My hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) spoke for the Liberal Democrats in that Committee, and he put to Ministers the sums by which there was underfunding by central Government of local authorities. He reminded the Committee that Oxfordshire's claim exceeded its funding by £30,000. He listed the London figures, and the under funding was significant not only in Haringey but elsewhere. Camden was under-compensated by more than £500,000 and Islington by more than £1.4 million. The total cost in London was £6,000,059 for adults and £10,000,201 for families. For the whole of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0226">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
England, the figures were £6,500,402 for adults and £11,106,194 for families. I understand that it was clear when the Committee met that the money was going to be adequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further irony is that the local authority that was to put in the largest bill for a shortfall was the local authority represented by the then Minister of State, the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Mrs. Roche), who was arguing that the money was enough. If ever there was a lack of communication it was between the London borough of Haringey and the hon. Lady, who represents Haringey. She should have known that there might have been a problem. Perhaps we can have an explanation of how that happened. If it was not a lack of joined-up government, it was a lack of joined-up information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall make two final points on grant report No. 99. I heard the Minister give the estimates for this year's figure. I would have thought that it was a little difficult to give an estimate for this year, as we do not know when the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill will have completed its passage and become law, although we can guess that that will be sometime in the autumn. If the Minister in her winding-up speech could give the monthly estimate, that would allow us to calculate, depending on when the Bill is enacted, to what extent local authorities will be reimbursed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not heard whether the Government believe that under the new system—under the Bill when enacted—the unit costs per child will be cheaper, so that money will be saved. The Treasury would benefit were that the case, but we must ensure that unaccompanied minors for whom we have a responsibility are looked after properly under whichever system is in place. There is a question—we have never quite been able to get to the bottom of it—of who can adjudicate independently on whether people are adults or children. Some youngsters coming from the other side of the world with no papers could be interpreted as being either. I am not suggesting that the Government are not seeking to get at the truth, but it seems to me important that the best independent advice is given and that an agency in which everyone can have confidence makes that decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise that I have to depart, but I am leaving affairs in the competent hands of my hon. Friend the Member for Colchester. As we are not seeking to divide the Committee, I trust that he will be able to report back to me and that the Minister can give answers either today, if possible, or later, if necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly try to address the issues that Opposition Members have raised. I am grateful that they are not going to divide the Committee on these important reports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the further comments that the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire made on Haringey, I am
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
well aware, as he and some of his colleagues may be, of the way in which the Government responded to some of the issues with which Haringey presented them at the time, because I was one of the Local Government Ministers and very much involved in the matter. I am grateful that you, Sir Nicholas, endorsed the position that I have taken on that matter in relation to this debate—that it is not appropriate to rehearse any of that detail in the context of a debate on the special grant reports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman raised another point about comparing the unit costs in the 92 report on adults and families with those involved in other ways of accommodating asylum seeking families. He mentioned Oakington and accommodation centres and said that he wanted comparisons. I must say that those costs are not at all comparable. We are clearly talking about a very different situation. The whole infrastructure costs of accommodating, feeding, caring for and staffing families in centres are very difficult to compare with the unit costs when people are living in the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looking at health, which is just one dimension of that, in accommodation centres, health, like education, will be provided on site. For asylum-seeking children in families, those costs are met via routes outside of the unit costs that go to local authorities. The local authority provides for a much more limited range of support. Education costs, for example, come through the per capita amount going to the local education authority and, through it, to schools. It is not possible really to compare those two different systems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire also raised the point that his hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham raised earlier about the difference in per capita rates between authorities caring for less than 100 unaccompanied asylum seeking-children and those caring for more than 100. I acknowledge to him and my hon. Friends that we recognise that the system is not perfect, which is why we are looking at changing it. I hope, however, that I can give him some assurance by saying that the figures have been negotiated with the local authority associations. They are not something that Government officials and Ministers have just dreamed up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the hon. Gentleman was concerned about the amount of the difference. He felt that the degree of difference was too large to be accounted for by different costs. In a sense that may be so across the board, but we are also trying to relate the costs to the reality of the situation through the negotiations. The reality of the situation is that most authorities with large numbers of asylum-seeking children—more than 100—are in London and the south-east, where the unit cost to the authorities is higher than in other parts of the country. Indirectly, that important factor has been fed into and has contributed to the difference in the figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a way, we cannot win with the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey. He referred to when the report was debated and said, as he often does, that he told us that the bill would be higher. We
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0227">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
knew that it might well be, but to have delayed payments to local authorities even longer because the estimates could not be finalised would have been something that he and others would have, rightly, criticised us for. Notwithstanding that, there were two significant issues that could not be resolved with two local authorities, and it did not seem right to us to delay the payments to the vast majority of local authorities at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said to hon. Members, we recognise that although the system was the best we could negotiate with local authorities, it is not perfect. To go forward we are considering whether we can refine a system based on unit costs, or whether we need to have more flexibility to enable us to pay local authorities to use the money in different ways. For example, Kent cares for large numbers and is looking at providing some sort of dedicated accommodation that is purpose-specific for young people. It is considering what that might look like. If we can have the flexibility to assist Kent with the cost of that special provision, we would want to do that. A unit cost-based approach might not give us that flexibility. We want to work with local authorities to devise something in the limits of the resources that we can put forward, that is as flexible as possible and meets their needs as well as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Bob Russell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Colchester)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could I suggest to the Minister that my hon. Friend the Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey was suggesting that where it is known what the likely costs are to a local authority month after month, it could have a sort of standing order rather than having to apply retrospectively?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Beverley Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take that point. As a former local authority leader myself, although not one responsible for large numbers of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children, I know that other special grant reports have traditionally worked in the same way.
