<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the outset, I wish to thank the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department for her explanation on the Floor of the House on 11 June in c.715 for the inconsistency of her reply to my written question, which was published in 	<i>Hansard</i> on 3 April 2002 in C.1036W. I am grateful to her for that and for setting the record straight. It was referred to in the other place by Baroness Greengross in a debate on S.I. 2002/833 on 9 May, c. 1340–1354, on the Court of Protection (Enduring Powers of Attorney) (Amendment) Rules 2002. I shall address that measure in particular and will allude to the debate in the other place on a number of occasions during my speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to repeat what was said by the noble Baroness Greengross or the noble Lord Kingsland in their excellent speeches, but I shall develop some of their points, especially those that did not receive full replies. I shall make some further inquiries and observations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have received submissions on the matter from the Law Society, the Alzheimer's Society and private individuals. The debate is about the Public Guardianship Office, formerly known as the Public Trust Office, and the substantial hike in many of the fees that it charges. I hope that I do not need to remind the Committee that this instrument has increased the fees for registering enduring powers of attorney from £75 to £220—by any standards a huge increase. Invariably, to be added to that cost of registration are legal fees—the lawyers' fees for doing the work—which at a modest estimate are likely to be £250 plus
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
value added tax, in other words £300. The minimum cost for most people of making such a registration will be about £520.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reduction in the receivership application fee from £230 to £65 is misleading. It would be welcomed were it not for the fact that the new first-year case set-up fee is £500, so the measure effectively increases the Public Guardianship Office fees for receivership application from £230 to £565. In addition, the winding-up fee is nearly trebled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate is important because the measures and costs impact on the lives of some of the most vulnerable people in our society who are incapable of managing their own affairs. Such people can easily be exploited by the unscrupulous, and the Committee must ensure that they get the necessary protection. I hope that it is clear to all members of the Committee that we should seek to encourage the proper registration of enduring powers of attorney, which give some protection against fraud and undue influence. It is in the interests of the public, as well as the donor of the power, to protect someone who is probably utterly dependent and open to exploitation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rise in fees is massively higher than the rate of inflation, for which there was no satisfactory explanation in the other place. I ask the Minister what pattern we should expect for future rises in fees. What is the future of the Public Guardianship Office? Will it continue to act as receiver and administrator? The Committee should be told the Government's long-term plans for it, so that that is on the record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The service that it purports to give leaves much to be desired, to say the least. I received an unsolicited letter dated 17 May from Mr. Allan Gregory of Holsworthy, who is a constituent. The heading was
	<br><blockquote><p>"Public Guardianship Office—utter degradation of service".</p></blockquote>
Two tranches of the letter bear scrutiny:
	<br><blockquote><p>"On three occasions, I have rung up the PGO Office. Each time I have been pushed from an initial contact into a queue waiting at least five minutes with an electronic voice, just as in a BR enquiry … Under the old system, the telephone was answered immediately and I was dealt with straightaway."</p></blockquote>
He makes a second point:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Over a fortnight ago I asked for a transfer of funds by telephone. I was asked to confirm in writing and I did so just over a fortnight ago. On checking the receiver's bank balance, I noted that the monies had not been transferred. I rang today at 09:30, and after the usual wait a young lady informed me that they were well inside the time for reply to correspondence—15 days!"</p></blockquote>
He makes the compelling argument that monies were transferred within a week under the old system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would have been reluctant to quote his letter if it had been the only example, but I am afraid that it is not. I have others. This morning, I checked with clients—[	<i>Laughter.</i>] I mean constituents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen O'Brien 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eddisbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A Freudian slip.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, a Freudian slip. I should say that I was a lawyer, but have not acted as such for three or four years. I left my law firm, although I still have a financial interest in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0074">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
I was about to say that the letter from which I quoted was not a sole example of inefficiency. This morning I checked with constituents who have a daughter with cerebral palsy. She received considerable damages for clinical negligence when she was a client of my firm, in which I was a partner at the time. I might add that I did not act in that particular case because I was a tax and commercial lawyer. I put that on the record for what it is worth. When I spoke to the girl's father, he told me that the whole state of affairs was dreadfully inefficient. What steps will the Government take to ensure that the service improves? What is the level of recruitment to the Public Guardianship Office?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Baroness Scotland wrote to Baroness Greengross on 10 June and mentioned the system of team working, but it does not seem to be working at all. My constituents complain that no one knows who is dealing with their affairs. One minute it is Mr. A, another minute Mrs. B, and so forth. There is no continuity of adviser, which is so important when sensitive matters are at stake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to advert to another matter mentioned in the debate in the other place—the judicial discretion of the Master of the Court of Protection, particularly in last resort receiverships. In the letter of 10 June 2002, Baroness Scotland wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I should like first of all to confirm that the changes we have made will not in any way undermine the discretion of the Master of the Court of Protection to act in the best interests of the client. That said, I very much feel that the best interests of the client, in those cases where it is not possible to appoint a close friend or relative as a receiver, will usually be best served by appointing a local professional person as receiver rather than the PGO, which is"—</p></blockquote>
these are the words of Baroness Scotland—
	<br><blockquote><p>"remote from the client, and which has inherited well-publicised problems from the Public Trustee Office."</p></blockquote>
That is hardly a ringing endorsement of the Public Guardianship Office. A key point for the Minister to reflect on is that a local professional person will often cost thousands of pounds per year in fees, whereas day-to-day administration charges in the Public Guardianship Office cost nothing. In exercising his discretion, the Master cannot ignore that. Will the Minister deal with that point in detail? If she would like to reflect further and write to me about it, I would be happy to receive a letter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A propos the position of the Master, did the Government consider levying a reasonable annual charge for management by the chief executive of the Public Guardianship Office in last resort cases, or do they want the office to wither and die? I put on record the fact that the Public Guardianship Office has had three chief executives in one year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Baroness Scotland explained in another place that monitoring the agency is the Minister's responsibility, but who monitors the panel receivers, how are they appointed, what qualifications do they need and how long do they stay on the panel before being reviewed? What steps are taken to ensure a satisfactory, competitive and geographical spread of panel solicitors? What arrangements are in force to protect vulnerable citizens from over-charging by panel solicitors? How easy is it to change receiver and
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
what is the cost? In other words, if one is with a panel receiver and wants to go to the PGO, how easy or complicated is it?
The noble Lord Kingsland made a very good point in a debate in the other place. He states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"it is not possible to extract any financial information from the PGO about particular patients without an order of the Court of Protection."—[	<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 9 May 2002; Vol. 634, c. 1345.]</p></blockquote>
That is an intolerable state of affairs. Properly interested parties should not be so fettered. What are the Government doing to change that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can only speculate about staff morale in the PGO. The Government owe the House and the public an explanation of exactly what they propose for its future. They must also explain the huge increase in fees and why there have been such inadequacies, inefficiencies and shortcomings in the PGO. I look forward to hearing from the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Cash 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stone)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Hood, not only on this occasion, but on the many occasions when we meet in the European Scrutiny Committee. That said, I shall make only one or two comments, because most of what I wanted to say has been said, and I do not believe in repeating arguments for the sake of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Burnett) has made a number of extremely important points, and I am glad to endorse on behalf of the official Opposition his remarks about Lord Kingsland, the shadow Lord Chancellor, who made an important contribution to this matter in another place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have the memorandum from the Lord Chancellor's Department in answer to the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments, on which I served once upon a time. With regard to the emphasis of the Public Guardianship Office now, it states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the fee has increased to reflect the true cost of the work involved in registering an enduring power of attorney."</p></blockquote>
We all want things to be done properly and efficiently but, for many of the reasons that have been given, there are significant problems in finding the money. I am thinking of the less well off, the poor and people with disabilities and their relatives, who suffer stress and strain; vulnerable people who need to be protected. I share the concern about what appears to be a rather callous increase in fees in these extremely difficult circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also concerned because the rises are well over the rate of inflation. It is up to the Parliamentary Secretary to try to justify that. The whole thing seems to be a bit of a ramp. Given the constraints in other parts of the public service, I cannot understand the multiple fees increases of up to as much as three times. There may be an explanation, and I should be interested to hear it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the previous remarks about the changeover in personnel and am concerned to hear how people get on the panel. I share the disquiet of Lord Kingsland and the hon. Member for Torridge
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0075">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
and West Devon about the difficulty of obtaining the information that one would expect to be able to get from the Public Guardianship Office. Having said that, it would be pointless for me to repeat any more. I look forward to the Parliamentary Secretary's comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department (Ms Rosie Winterton)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a great pleasure, Mr. Hood, to serve under your chairmanship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several concerns have been raised, and I want to respond by setting out in some detail the reasons behind the increases and decreases in the charges. I start by repeating the astute observation of the hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon that the Public Guardianship Office plays a crucial role in the lives of some of the most vulnerable people in society; people who suffer mental incapacity. Its clients include people who suffer from mental illness, have learning disabilities, or have suffered brain damage, as well as elderly people who suffer the effects of dementia.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that there are concerns that some of the fees have been increased, and I shall explain the principles that we have followed in setting the new fees. Hon. Members may know that the Public Accounts Committee conducted an inquiry in 1999 into the affairs of the Public Trust Office, which was the predecessor of the Public Guardianship Office. The report, titled "Public Trust Office: Protecting the Financial Welfare of People with Mental Incapacity", was published in July 1999. As well as making recommendations for improved systems and procedures for the raising, recording, review and collection of fee income, the report examined how well the PTO was recovering its costs through fees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The power to charge fees is contained in the Mental Health Act 1983, and successive Governments have followed the consensus that, as far as possible, the cost of services should be recovered through fees. They have also agreed that people who need to use services but cannot afford to pay should have their fees waived, and that cross-subsidy should be eliminated as far as possible so that users of one service do not subsidise the users of another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be appropriate at this stage to repeat my earlier question. Did the Government consider levying a reasonable, perhaps means-related, annual charge for management by the chief executive of the Public Guardianship Office?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may become clear as I continue my explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The PAC found that there was cross-subsidy between private receivership clients and clients whose cases were managed by the Public Trust Office. Clients with private receivers were paying more than the cost of the services they received in order to cover costs that should have been borne by clients whose cases were managed publicly. At the PAC hearing on 24 February 1999, the notion of cross-subsidy between clients with
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
mental incapacity was described as grotesque and offensive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The PAC concluded that the PTO should examine the scope for efficiency savings to bring down fee levels, but also noted the Lord Chancellor's Department's view that some element of public subsidy was required for receivership cases managed by the office. The PAC report touched only on the issue of subsidies between clients in private and public receivership. It did not touch on issues of cross-subsidy between private receivership clients, or between private receivership and the enduring power of attorney clients. The PTO's quinquennial review report, published in November 1999, recognised that there was an even wider problem of cross-subsidy than had been highlighted by the PAC.

The report's author, Ann Chant, noted that, in many cases, people of modest means were paying far more than they needed to for the PTO's services and were also paying for services received by others. The report recommended that a simple, viable and auditable system of fees should be devised and that the PTO's financial and management information systems should be enhanced to allow them to support a business-based fee structure, to be agreed with the Treasury.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Heath 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Somerton and Frome)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has not a subsidy between classes of clients been replaced by a cross-subsidy between past clients, who were underserved where there was under-investment in the service, and current clients, who are paying for the catch-up process described by the Lord Chancellor's Office?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That should not be the case. I hope that some of the improvements that we will come on to will benefit all clients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following the quinquennial review, the Lord Chancellor published a consultation paper in April 2000 setting out his plans for the reform of the PTO to meet some of the criticisms that had been made by the PAC. That resulted in the transfer of the Court Funds Office to the Court Service, the transfer of public trustee work to the Official Solicitor's Office and the establishment of a new agency, the Public Guardianship Office, to look after the affairs of people with mental incapacity. In the months that followed, much detailed work took place to take on board the outcome of the consultation, to determine the business processes of the new agency, to establish its new systems and to refocus its culture towards providing responsive services to meet its clients' individual needs. That work culminated in the publication of detailed plans for change by the Lord Chancellor in December 2000 in the report "Making Changes".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By March 2001, shortly before the launch of the Public Guardianship Office, the systems and future business process of the new organisation had crystallised and it became clear that the fees regime introduced in September 2000 would not meet the objects of cost recovery or eliminate cross-subsidy. My predecessor in the Lord Chancellor's Department quickly commissioned work to look at the fees
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0076">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
strategy to ensure that the Public Guardianship Office was financially viable and to introduce a fair regime for clients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A fees strategy working group was set up to advise on the regime, comprising officials from not only the Public Guardianship Office but the Lord Chancellor's Department, the Court Service and the Treasury, as recommended in the quinquennial review. In developing that strategy, an independent management accountant was appointed who previously had the task of identifying the costs of civil court business and worked with the senior costs judge on benchmark lawyers costs for civil cases in the fast and multi-tracks. The fees strategy working group concluded that the fee structure was unrealistic and would not deliver the level of service required by clients. It recommended a fees regime that was closely aligned to business processes and was justifiable in terms of the underlying cost, with public funding focused on the most vulnerable group of clients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new fees fulfil those aims. They ensure that fees reflect costs and eliminate cross-subsidy between groups of clients. They will allow the Public Guardianship Office to develop and improve its services and, most importantly, they contain improved protection and support and represent better value for poorer clients.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Parliamentary Secretary agree that it is important to encourage people to register powers of attorney at the appropriate time? Given that there are invariably legal fees to pay in addition, the new fee structure will prove a discouragement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that it will. We have evidence that that has not happened since the new scheme was introduced. I will come later to the reasoning behind the figure of £230 and hope to reassure the hon. Gentleman on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members have focused on where fees have increased. I will respond to their concerns, but I want to point out first that there has been a reduction in fees. For protection cases, the commencement fee—which covers the cost of processing a first application to the court—has been reduced from £230 to £65. In court of protection cases where clients have net assets of less than £16,000, their representative can be given authority to manage a client's finances under what is termed a short order and will have to pay only the £65 fee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I suggested earlier, and as the Parliamentary Secretary rightly said, there is a reduction in the fee for the receivership application from £230 to £65, but the new first year case set-up fee is £500. That effectively represents a substantial increase.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it is an increase, but I shall deal later with what the first-year commencement fee covers. Given that we intend to adhere to the principle of recovering costs wherever possible, while catering for the least well-off clients, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree that the charge is not unreasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
The court issues a short order where the client's assets are such that full receivership is not required. The applicant is then authorised to deal with the assets without further reference to the court, although it has the right to call that person to account where necessary. Such an order is a way of saying that people in cases where the assets are less than £16,000 should be allowed, as far as possible, to get on with overcoming the problems that have been highlighted. This is a clear example of how we have said that the most vulnerable clients can be protected under the new fees strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The officers of the court of protection and the PGO have also developed new guidelines for the remission of fees, which are more generous and more wide-ranging than in the past, and which will be more widely publicised. In arriving at the remission of fees strategy, they consulted widely with organisations such as Age Concern, the Alzheimer's Society, Action on Elder Abuse, Mind and the Law Society, and the strategy reflects their views. To take one example of how it will work, the guidelines will increase the capital limit for the remission of fees from £3,000 to £11,750, which is an increase of almost 300 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be helpful for hon. Members to know about two other aspects of the remissions scheme. Mention has been made of the increase in EPA registration fees, and I shall explain later what they cover and why we settled on them. Under the revised remissions guidelines, clients with assets of less than £16,000 will be treated in the same way as short order protection clients, and will pay a registration fee of only £65.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Torridge and West Devon and for Stone (Mr. Cash) asked what the full EPA registration fee covered. It covers the cost of registration, handling disputes and technical problems, correspondence during and after registration, helping and advising attorneys or their legal representatives, investigating allegations of financial abuse against the donor, and cancelling registration on the death of the donor. The registration fee covers that work over the life of a case, and does not simply cover the act of registering a document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon mentioned adding solicitors fees to the registration fee, but most people do not need to use a solicitor to register an EPA. We want to ensure that the Public Guardianship Office is in a position to explain the process properly and that the forms are as straightforward and as easy to complete as possible so that it is unnecessary for people to use solicitors' services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both the hon. Members for Torridge and West Devon and for Stone have asked how the figure has been arrived at, compared with the earlier figure. Part of the enduring power of attorney registration fee is used to cover the resolution of disputes that may arise. That is obviously time-consuming and costly in court time. Of nearly 800 cases a year, 50 per cent. may result in a court hearing. The average cost of dealing with those disputes is £1,262. Some have suggested that there should be a low fee for registration, but a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0077">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
charge if the matter needs to be taken to court. We have rejected that suggestion because we feel that that would deter people who, for various reasons, wish to challenge the enduring power of attorney. It would be unfair to take that out of the equation because the money comes from people's savings. We are able to do that within the cross-subsidy rules. Thus, in a sense, the enduring power of attorney fee allows people to make challenges if necessary. It is a sort of insurance and means that people are not deterred from bringing a challenge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been concerns that the fee might deter people from registering. However, there were 2,537 applications to register an enduring power of attorney in April and May this year, and for the equivalent period last year, there were 2,089 applications. The publicity surrounding the new fees and, in particular, our work with organisations to publicise the remissions guidelines have drawn people's attention to the benefit of enduring power of attorney registration. We feel that that is a positive move in the right direction. It is crucial that we get the publication of those extremely important guidelines right—that is already evident. In the previous financial year, which finished in March 2002, an average of 15 commencement fees per month was remitted for receivership cases. However, in May 2002, since the introduction of the new fees and the publication of the remission guidelines, 95 commencement fees have been remitted, which is almost half the total number of remissions made last year. The figures for June are not much different. Through the efforts that have been made to publicise the guidelines, we have been able to give much greater protection to the poorest clients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope it reassures hon. Members to know that the PGO will retain the discretion to remit fees for clients who do not meet the criteria, if it judges that they would suffer financial hardship as a result. We are keen to maintain that discretion because it is not the intention of the court to limit its ability to determine cases of hardship in relation to clients who fall outside the guidelines. For example, one individual returned to this country after living in Australia for some time, where he had been involved in an accident and awarded compensation. The compensation had the effect of taking his total capital beyond the level set out in the guidelines, but his award was subject to a matrimonial claim in Australia, which meant that he had limited access to those funds until the matter was resolved. In those circumstances, it would be right for the court to postpone payment of his fees until the funds could be accessed, although it would also have discretion not to collect the fees at all. We are keen to ensure that that discretion is maintained. We intend to consider a new format for publicising it, giving examples of how hardship will be judged, so that people know that they can ask for remission of fees in certain circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to give one more example of how the new fees scheme will protect the poorest clients. We have now devolved the PGO's in-house receivership work to panel receivers, a matter that was raised by the hon.
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
Members for Torridge and West Devon and for Stone. We felt that that was important because, in many instances, it will be in the client's best interests to have their case dealt with by someone locally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both hon. Members asked how receivers are appointed to the panel. Adverts are placed and individuals are invited to apply, but they have to act within the framework of a service level agreement. Issues have also been raised in connection with the amount of money charged by panel receivers. The PGO enters a service level agreement with every panel receiver, which states that, for solicitors in private practice, payment may be made either through fixed costs, as agreed annually with the Law Society, or by filing a bill for assessment by the Supreme Court costs office. Solicitors usually charge fixed costs of £900. Panel receivers do not usually deal with the very difficult cases of last resort, which the PGO tends to retain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that, to be appointed to the panel, one must be a solicitor in private practice, with the insurance to back that up? If that is not the case, will she say what the qualifications are for getting on the panel and say what the insurance ramifications are? What satisfaction does one have to give, how long does one stay on the panel and how is one monitored while one is on it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The vast majority are solicitors, but there is also a small number of accountants and a charitable organisation. I believe that there is also a former local authority employee. The panel receivers are supervised, and the Court of Protection works closely with them to ensure that charges made to clients by different panel receivers are consistent and fair. We shall take steps to ensure that that consistency continues. Some of that can be achieved through the service level agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the concerns that have been expressed by hon. Members about the PGO's service performance, and hope to be able to give them welcome news about the improvements that have taken place, at the same time as assuring them of our commitment to continual improvement. Since the launch some 15 months ago, there has been a major programme of change, designed to address the criticisms that have been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clients and their receivers now receive many more visits than they did previously. Last year, over 6,000 visits were made, including visits to new clients and to all clients for whom the PGO was the receiver. The number of visits to clients whose affairs are being managed by private receivers is more than double that carried out just two years ago. In order to increase the number of visits, the PGO has recruited more visitors. Almost all of the new recruits have a social work or medical background. The PGO has also developed measures to monitor the visits in order to ensure that they fulfil their purpose and that issues that arise are addressed quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The collection of outstanding receivers' accounts was, perhaps, of the greatest concern to the Public Accounts Committee. At the time of the Public Accounts Committee hearing, receivership accounts
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0078">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
were overdue in some 6,350 cases. A process has been put in place to ensure that receivers account on time. There are now only 975 cases in which an account is overdue by two months or more. The key performance measure for accounts collection since 1 April 2001 has been to collect 50 per cent. of accounts within two months, 75 per cent. within 4 months and 100 per cent. within six months. The two and four month targets were more than achieved and the 100 per cent. target was met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the time of the hearing there were also some 3,650 accounts awaiting review. That figure has been reduced to 803, about half of which are cases in which, although the accounts have been rendered, further information is needed from the receiver. The key performance measure for 2002–3 will be to review 100 per cent. of accounts within five weeks of receipt. There have been criticisms, but the PGO is meeting, and in some cases exceeding, those service delivery targets. Communication with clients and receivers has been improved by producing better information and devising simpler and clearer forms. As I said, the PGO has also set up a support network of experienced receivers to help and advise those who are new to the task.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are all aware that problems remain to be tackled. There has been a major reorganisation involving the PGO moving its offices up to Archway, which will pay dividends in the long term. It has led to arrears of work and a disruption to the service, which in turn has led to an increase in the number of complaints, but I hope that hon. Members will be reassured that the staff are extremely committed to providing a good service. They feel that we are trying to establish systems that will improve their ways of working, and we are involving them in the decisions on how that work can be improved. The people who work in the PGO and deal with the vulnerable clients do not want to provide a bad service, but we must set up proper management systems and team working to ensure that they can deliver.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon mentioned particular problems in which cases dealt with by one person changed to using a team working approach. There were problems in the past with the one-to-one approach when difficulties arose between a receiver and a particular individual.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to hinder the Minister, but how many people are in a team?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Winterton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We aim to move to smaller teams of about four people, although teams are slightly larger at the moment. I understand the point about ensuring that a client does not get passed around, but the individual approach had some particular problems. For example, when someone went on holiday, no one knew about or could deal with his or her case. We were asked to address that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An arrears team has been set up to reply to the outstanding work, and it has now cleared more than 5,000 items of outstanding correspondence. I visited Archway and saw the team's work, and I know that it is committed. Its work should be commended. Ahead of computerisation, there have been problems in delivering an effective service to callers using call
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
centres. We have responded to that because receivers and solicitors did not like the approach. Plans are now being made to examine that and work with our users to see how we can improve the service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Torridge and West Devon referred to the problems in locating case records. We are examining improvements to the file registry service and have established a new messenger service to ensure that file movement within the office operates smoothly. As the workers have found, a case file can often be required at different times by different parts of the office. The paper-based filing system means that there have been problems locating files. We are considering locating the files much closer to the client advisers and have established a new file-tracking system. Files are being bar coded, so that a computer can track their location in the office. We are also considering establishing the new MERIS casework system in a year's time, so that much more information will be available to staff on screen. That will serve the PGO and its clients better, and we will be able to dispense with the old paper-based system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The former Public Trust Office's poor management of receivership cases is well documented and the PGO acknowledges that there are continuing problems. That is why we want to ensure that family members and local professionals can increasingly take on the responsibility to take those decisions, but with proper supervision. There is a balance: the hon. Gentleman referred to Baroness Scotland's letter. We must acknowledge that people want to take some decisions quickly, and that they find it much easier if there is someone local. It is therefore important that we take the remoteness out of the system, which we are working hard to achieve. We must also ensure that we provide the proper protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentlemen also talked about information about individuals. Again, the PGO and the court must balance the individual's right to privacy with the interests of family members who want information about a client. Requests can be difficult, and a decision must be taken with those factors in mind. That is why each request is considered on its merits. It is important to allow the PGO and the court to retain that discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have set out some of the reasons why we introduced those fees, and given reassurances that we introduced them in response to criticisms that have long been made by the Public Accounts Committee and others about the operation of the system. I also hope that we have struck the right balance in ensuring that one set of clients does not pay for another, which was something that used to affect the very vulnerable clients.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is coming to the end of her speech.

I hope that I have reassured members of the Committee that we tried to devise a strategy that responds to previous criticisms, but that also makes more generous provision for remission of fees for the poorest clients. I hope that the Committee will accept the rules.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.59 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an important and useful debate. The Minister has rightly stated that the Public Guardianship Office still has problems. I congratulate her on giving her conscientious attention to this important matter.
