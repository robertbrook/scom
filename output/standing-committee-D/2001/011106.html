	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development (Hilary Benn)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the European Communities (Definition of Treaties) (Partnership Agreement between the Members of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States and the European Community and its Member States (The Cotonou Agreement)) Order 2001.</p></blockquote>
It is a pleasure to be here this morning. I understand, Mr. Conway, that this is your first outing as a Chairman of a Committee that is discussing delegated legislation. It is also my first outing as a Minister in such a Committee, which probably means that we can guide each other gently, under your tutelage, through the proceedings to what I hope will be a satisfactory outcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is just over 10 years since the Lomé convention, the predecessor agreement to Cotonou, was approved by the House. In her speech moving the adoption of that order, the then Minister for Overseas Development—now Baroness Chalker—said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"if developing countries are to make sustainable economic and social progress, they need to participate as fully as possible in the world economy.—[	<i>Official Report</i>, 26 February 1991; Vol. 186, c. 934.]</p></blockquote>
Those words were true then and they still hold true today. Sustainable progress remains the goal of our development effort. However, despite the progress that has been made in the last half of the past century, we have entered this new century with one in four of our fellow human beings still living in extreme poverty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure, therefore, that the Committee will recognise that we face a considerable challenge, which has been made more urgent by the events of the past six weeks. Poverty, inequality and injustice are not excuses for terrorism, nor are they the cause of the terrible events of 11 September, but their existence can be a source of resentment and alienation that those who are prepared to use violent means can exploit for support. One matter on which we should reflect is that, as powerful as it was before 11 September, the case for tackling poverty, inequality and injustice is even more powerful now. The Cotonou agreement, alongside many other instruments and policies, has a
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
contribution to make in turning the aspirations that we all share into changes that benefit those in the world who have the least.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the European Community is the world's largest multilateral grant provider, the world's largest single market and the main trading partner of most developing countries, it can potentially make a huge contribution to eradicating global poverty. In the past, the EC has not fulfilled that potential, but the new Cotonou agreement between the European Community, its member states and the countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific represents a landmark, not least because Cotonou has a clear, overall objective, which is to reduce poverty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Cotonou agreement is a successor to the Lomé conventions and marks the most important revision of the relationship between the EC and the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries since the first Lomé convention was signed in 1975. At the time, the first Lomé convention was regarded as a flagship agreement. It embraced the principle of partnership between Europe and the ACP states and it brought together trade, political and development cooperation within a single agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those were the right principles but, unfortunately, the convention did not have the effect that we all wanted. Between 1980 and 1997, the ACP countries' share of EU imports decreased from 10 per cent, to 4 per cent. Meanwhile, world trade liberalisation eroded the ACP countries' relative preferences, which also fell foul of World Trade Organisation rules, as highlighted, for example, by the recent banana dispute. Furthermore, the impact of the EC's development assistance was disappointing. For all those reasons, a substantial revision of the relationship was clearly needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have worked hard, and successfully, to ensure that the Cotonou agreement is a good agreement for the ACP countries. The European Union's negotiating mandate was agreed during the most recent British EU Presidency in 1998. Negotiations started in that same year and were concluded in 2000. The negotiations were hard, but all the UK's main objectives were agreed. First, poverty reduction was made the agreement's overriding objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, improved financial management of and better procedures for the European development fund were agreed, and in exchange for those improvements in the way in which it operates, a significant replenishment of the ninth EDF was agreed, which will give the Commission potential spending power of approximately 3 billion euros a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, there was a re-affirmation of the essential elements of human rights, democracy and the rule of law. As under Lomé, there is a process for consultation and possible action if those principles are breached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, it was agreed to ensure that good governance is a fundamental element underpinning the new agreement. For example, for the first time, it will be possible to take action in cases of severe corruption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0014">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
All of that is founded on the same principle of partnership—the EU and the ACP talking to each other as equals. The new emphasis on mutual responsibility is also a feature of the new partnership for African development, which represents a bold initiative of African leadership to address African challenges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the most important aspects of Cotonou is the new trade deal between the EU and the ACP states. The arrangement maximises ACP access to the EU market while promoting gradual integration into the global economy. As we know—this is highly relevant to the debates that will take place in Doha later this week—the potential benefit of improved trade with developing countries is much greater in the long run than that from development assistance programmes alone. That echoes the remarks made by my predecessor in moving the Lomé convention in 1991.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under Cotonou, the EU is committed to open its market to a substantial group of developing countries. That is an important part of the EU's strategy to promote a new trade round and to ensure that it is a new development round. The ACP's current preferential arrangements will be maintained until 2008, after which new, WTO-compatible arrangements will come into effect. Those will be free trade agreements between groups of ACP countries and the EU but, to allow ACP countries time to adjust, fully reciprocal free trade will not be expected until about 20 years from now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the Government's main concerns in the negotiations was for those countries that will not be able to join free trade areas in 2008. We secured two important objectives in that regard. The first is that the least developed countries—the poorest countries—will benefit from the EU's commitment to allow duty-free access for, essentially, all their products by 2005. As Members will be aware, that change has been implemented early through the everything but arms decision. The second is that there is a safety net for other developing countries that would not be covered by a regional agreement or are not LDC countries. The EU has undertaken to examine all possibilities to provide a new, WTO-compatible trading framework with benefits that are equivalent to those available under the Lomé convention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cotonou is, of course, not the whole story of the Community's relations with African, Caribbean and Pacific countries. The impact of other Community policies on matters such as investment, agriculture and fisheries is also substantial. Therefore, the Government are working with our partners in Europe to ensure that those policies are consistent with the Community's development objectives, especially through significant reform of the common agricultural policy and the common fisheries policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally, although the improvements that Cotonou will make to the Community's development assistance programme are welcome, they too need to be accompanied by substantial and broader reform. The Commission has embarked on a process aimed at tackling many of the institutional weaknesses of the past. For example, it has begun a process of what is
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
described, in European parlance, as "deconcentration"—I think that we would refer to it as decentralisation and delegation—of staff, resources and greater autonomy to its delegations in country. We hope that that will make the Community a more responsive development partner, which is what we really need. It has improved its systems and procedures, with a common framework for its country and regional strategy papers, a simplified contracting procedure, and a quality support group to promote best practice. A new office, EuropeAid, has been set up to handle implementation of the EC programmes. The challenge now is to ensure that all the reforms are implemented effectively, efficiently and fully, while continuing to press for wider change—not least to increase the proportion of EC development aid for the poorest countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Cotonou agreement represents a further development of the relationship between the European Community and the ACP states. It has at its heart the goal of poverty reduction and, ultimately, poverty elimination, through the instruments of development, trade and political dialogue. Together with the wider reforms to which I referred, it is in my view an important step forward in helping to ensure that the European Community contributes in the way that it should towards achieving the millennium development goals. For that reason, I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.41 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Hawkins 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Surrey Heath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome you to your first chairmanship of a Standing Committee, Mr. Conway. I am sure that our proceedings will be conducted in good spirit, briefly and efficiently under your benign chairmanship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The official Opposition have no serious concern about the order. We support the Cotonou agreement and agree with the Minister that much of its content is to be welcomed. I was delighted to hear the Minister acknowledge that a great deal of work needs to be done further to reform the common agricultural policy and the common fisheries policy. We have pressed for such work for a very long time, and we hope that the Government will make greater efforts to speed up those necessary reforms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have, however, one or two specific worries on which I ask the Minister to comment. I was surprised to hear him applaud incorporation in the agreement of anti-corruption measures, given that, despite our repeated efforts, the Government have consistently failed to incorporate such measures in the International Development Bill, which the House will debate again tomorrow. I ask the Minister to comment on the inconsistency between his praise for article 33(2), which states,
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Parties shall work together in the fight against bribery and corruption in all their societies",</p></blockquote>
and on the Government's consistent refusal to accept amendments to the International Development Bill to introduce anti-corruption provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0015">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
As for the effect of trading arrangements on least-developed countries, I was again surprised to hear the Minister boast that it was wonderful that the everything but arms initiative had advanced the timing of certain proposals. He ought to be aware that the proposals have caused enormous concern in relation to sugar, particularly in the least developed countries of the Caribbean. Will the Minister comment on the serious worries expressed by a number of his right hon. and hon. Friends, including senior members of the Select Committee on International Development, at meetings before the summer recess? They were savagely critical of some of the EBA initiative's effects on the sugar trade. Many of the Minister's colleagues said that the proposals to which the Government intended to sign up could destroy the economies of several Caribbean islands. I hope that the Minister will refer to that issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, I do not want my comments to be interpreted as an overall criticism of this worthwhile agreement. The very important work of Baroness Chalker of Wallasey—the Minister rightly praised her work on Lomé some 10 years ago—needs to be updated. There has been a great deal of cross-party agreement on the need to improve relations between the European Community and the ACP countries, and we hope that that work will continue. As long as the concerns that I have expressed are addressed—the need for major reform of the CAP and the CFP, the needs of Caribbean countries in relation to sugar, and issues such as the recent problem with bananas, which the Minister mentioned—the agreement will provide a worthwhile framework for future relations. I therefore do not oppose the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Allan	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Hallam)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I make you thrice welcome to the Chair, Mr. Conway. On behalf of the unofficial Opposition, I welcome the order and the agreement to which it refers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agreement shows the strength of the European Union as a negotiating bloc. I am in no doubt that if the ACP countries simply had bilateral agreements with individual nation states in Europe, their preferential treatment would not have been so defensible as it is in the context of a multilateral agreement between the EU as a bloc and various countries that have historic relationships with European Union member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to European aid programmes, which, as he rightly pointed out, are also an important development, alongside trade. Will he follow up the issue of the lower cash limit for accessing European aid programmes? That has been raised with me over Colombia, and I am sure that it applies equally in other countries. Some smaller groups involved in human rights feel that the infrastructure required to get into some of the aid programmes that the EU is rightly promoting presents too great a hurdle. I am sure that that is comparable to community groups in this country trying to access objective 1 or other European
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
programmes. I hope that the Minister will examine that. It is important that we support grassroots groups that might not be looking for very much money and might not have the infrastructure of the larger, state-backed organisations, but want to be in on the programmes and might even do a better job than some of the other organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On trading, there is a strong feeling that fair trade can help development, as the Minister pointed out, and the order seeks to bring it into play for a specific group of countries. Conversely, unfair trade can add to inequality. Although concerns about that have often been inappropriately or incoherently expressed in protests against the WTO, there is much validity in them. I find it regrettable that the actions of a few have often obscured the genuine concerns of the many. Some of my constituents went on protests as part of the Jubilee 2000 coalition and other groups and had to sit out when violence broke out. They were thus prevented from taking part in legitimate protest. Can the Minister assure us that the UK Government, in discussing both the future of the ACP countries and wider trade issues, will play an active role in Doha and respond to genuine concerns about our fellow human beings in developing countries?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister's Department will want to take a role in consumer awareness. The banana dispute made people very aware of the concerns of the banana-producing Caribbean countries. However, they sometimes gain a distorted view of the market, and find it difficult to know who are the good guys and the bad guys. For example, Ecuador has a large number of local banana producers who feed money into the local economy—a good model for developing countries—but in other countries bananas are produced by a large, foreign-owned multinational that is clearly exploitative, so one might not want to purchase those bananas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Banana producers range from the small producers in the Caribbean and in Latin American countries to the large multinational. Consumers must be given more help in ascertaining from whom they are buying bananas. Whatever trade agreements exist, and whatever the WTO rules, the consumer ultimately makes the decision and can express a preference for one country's produce. Bananas are one example; there are many others. I hope that the Minister's Department can assist consumers in exercising their purchasing power. That is a valid international development role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point is about the quaintness of the procedure for making known the date on which the treaty comes into effect. It will be advertised in that well-known and widely-read publication, the 	<i>London Gazette</i>, which is also published in Edinburgh and Belfast. It seems curious, in a week in which the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen) is publishing a book on the constitutional settlement of the UK, that a treaty of this importance is still subject to a procedure whereby it is agreed through a statutory instrument, then advertised in non-mainstream publications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0016">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
I welcome the agreement and hope that the Minister and his colleagues are able to negotiate a soft landing for the ACP countries, which were worried a few years back that they would experience a hard landing as Lomé came to an end and the World Trade Organisation reduced the advantages that they had enjoyed over time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.50 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hilary Benn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall first respond to the points raised by the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Mr. Hawkins). I thank him for supporting the order and the new convention on behalf of the official Opposition. That is very much in the spirit of the tradition of bipartisan support for the predecessors of Cotonou.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman and I are also at one on the common agricultural policy and the common fisheries policy. The present Government, the previous Labour Government and four previous Conservative Governments have grappled with the issue, both before and after the famous renegotiations of 1975 under the then Prime Minister, Harold Wilson. It is in the nature of our membership of the European Community that to achieve reform one has to persuade other member states to follow one's point of view. We must continue to work hard on that.

We will no doubt debate anti-corruption legislation further tomorrow on Second Reading of the International Development Bill. We are committed to legislate, and if the hon. Member for Surrey Heath watches this space he will find himself satisfied.

On sugar, the UK has been active in attempting to safeguard and promote Caribbean trade interests. We have been a prime supporter of the Caribbean regional negotiating machinery, which is the key body charged by the Caribbean community with representing the region's interests in the range of international trade negotiations taking place not only in the EU but in the World Trade Organisation. The UK was instrumental in obtaining extended transition periods for sugar and bananas, which are sensitive Caribbean products—as well as rice, which is also significant under the everything but arms initiative. That means that the Caribbean will not be faced with full tariff-free competition in the European market from other least-developed countries until 2006 for bananas and 2009 for sugar and rice. We are also providing technical support to the regional negotiating machinery, and the EU will seek other ways in which to provide assistance to economies that are particularly dependent on sugar.

Turning to the comments of the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Allan), I concur with what he said about infrastructure obstacles to obtaining access to EC support. Anyone who has ever contemplated, let alone attempted, filling in the forms and going through the procedures that are required will understand that it is necessary to simplify them not only to enable the EC to implement its decisions as quickly as possible but to ensure that the wider community—especially civil society—can participate. That is a feature of the development programmes that the Department for International Development undertakes in several countries; we encourage the development of civil
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
societies that play an active role in their country to help promote development. Such programmes give a voice to the community, and in particular to the poor, which can put pressure on Governments to achieve change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have seen examples of programmes in which UK Government bilateral aid has allowed small groups in civil society to become engaged with the process. My concern is that we may exclude those smaller groups where we route large amounts of UK aid via an EU programme. Colombia, where we are signed up to a large development programme under the auspices of the EU, is a specific example of that problem. I hope that the Minister will realign the EU programme with the good practice in the bilateral programmes undertaken by the UK.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hilary Benn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's point. One benefit of the deconcentration process of delegating resources and responsibility to EC programmes is that it should become easier to form relationships with civil society. Our aid budget is increasing, which is a nice position for the UK to be in compared with the 1980s and 1990s. That gives DFID a greater opportunity to support civil society, which is the heart of our philosophy.

I much appreciate the remarks made by the hon. Member for Hallam about the role that trade can and does play in aiding development, especially in relation to the World Trade Organisation. It should not be a matter of argument that there should be an international, intergovernmental, rules-based trading system to determine the nature of trading relationships among sovereign states. That must be right. Some of those who come out on the streets and protest say, "Away with the WTO", but they are fundamentally misguided. At the end of the second world war, we established an international, rules-based, intergovernmental institution called the United Nations to regulate political, diplomatic and other relations between sovereign states. That principle must be right. The argument is about the rules and agreements under which that body operates. That will be a subject of lively debate at Doha at the end of this week, and rightly so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are playing an active part in responding to the legitimate point about the capacity of some developing countries to participate in the WTO process. One practical thing that we have done as a Department is to give financial support to those countries that cannot maintain permanent representation at the WTO. That will improve the capacity of those sovereign Governments to express their views and be involved in reaching an agreement through consensus, which is how the WTO operates, about what the world trading community wants to debate in future.

On consumer information, I endorse the remarks of the hon. Member for Hallam, which related to the issue of bananas. I recently met the Fairtrade Foundation, which, among other things, promotes fairly traded products. The latest product that it has added to its list is bananas, which are selling extremely well. We offer support to the fair trade movement, which is one practical way to make progress.

I hesitate to comment on the 	<i>London Gazette</i>, which is also published in Edinburgh and Belfast. I must confess to the Committee that it is not a publication that forms part of my regular reading. However, others who are much better qualified than me will be able to reassure the Committee that that is the way in which these things are done. These days, if we want to find out what is going on we rely on the media's reporting of developments—when the Cotonou agreement was signed it received a certain amount of publicity. I fear that our discussions today, interesting though they have been, will not necessarily figure in tomorrow's list of priorities for the media. However, the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam made a fair point that is probably for others to pick up.

Another reason why the agreement is so important is that it reflects the development philosophy, which DFID has been developing and promoting in recent years, that has featured in exchanges in Committees such as this. Poverty reduction is the central goal, but other aims are included—the effective use of aid; good governance; the need for a stable macro-economic framework; the recognition that economic
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
development and trade are good for developing countries. Most important, it clearly comes across in the opening parts of the Cotonou agreement that developing countries and ACP states must have ownership of process. This is about assisting countries in getting to where they want to go, not about our attempting to tell them where they should go. Philosophically, that is important; the best thing we can do to help developing countries is to support them in their future development. When one combines those elements with the power of the EU in particular, the agreement could become a powerful force for development. The Cotonou agreement marks a step along that journey and I commend the order to Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
