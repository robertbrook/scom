	<p>	<div class='member'>Michael Fabricant	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lichfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Cran. The statutory instrument consists of 31 pages and you will know that during Prime Minister's questions today, the issue of bed blocking was raised. The statutory instrument will affect that, so do you not agree that it is a form of primary legislation, which should be discussed on the Floor of the House?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should know better than to ask the Chairman to have any view. I have no view on the matter. The hon. Gentleman has made his point, and no doubt he will seek to make a speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it the wish of the Committee that the two statutory instruments be debated together?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Burns	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Chelmsford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.31 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Private and Voluntary Health Care (England) Regulations 2001 (S.I. 2001, No. 3968).</p></blockquote>
It is an unexpected pleasure, Mr. Cran, that you are chairing our proceedings today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing today two statutory instruments. The first refers to private health care, and I draw the Committee's attention to the 16th report of the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments. The Minister was present yesterday when two unrelated orders on health subjects were discussed, so she will know that the Joint Committee reported that of the four statutory instruments, two of which are before us today, two had defective drafting, and that that was acknowledged by the Department of Health. The Minister may have given an explanation in her speech yesterday, but I do not know what the Department of Health intends to do to rectify the defective drafting, which goes to the nub of enforcement of the orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report reveals a shambolic and ridiculous situation. I accept that the Department has said that it will consider how the orders may be amended, but it is odd that we should be discussing legislation that is defective and a coach and horses have been driven through it. It might have been more intelligent if, when the defect was identified, the statutory instruments had been withdrawn, the problem resolved and the orders
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
then placed before the House again so that we could debate legislation that did not contain serious problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will be aware that the order is made under the Care Standards Act 2000 and lays down the nature of the establishments covered by the Act and the standards to be applied by the National Care Standards Commission. So that there is no misunderstanding, I want to put it on record at the outset that we support and agree with the concept of raising standards in the private health sector, particularly as the Government, to the distress of many of their Back Benchers, seem determined, through the concordat and the extension of its scope, to involve the private sector far more in the provision of health care. We all know that that is because the Government raised expectations to such a high level that no Government could have satisfied them. Their failure to do so has got the Government into considerable trouble, and now, almost in desperation, they are turning everything that they believed in on its head and seeking more and more use of the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The significance of many aspects of the regulations is that my constituents, and I assume those of most Labour Members, do not mind who provides their health care as long as it is to the highest standards, is carried out as swiftly as possible, and is free at the point of use.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Michael Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend that we want to maintain high standards and that, therefore, we welcome the general principle of the regulations. However, does he agree that if the conditions are so tight that care homes close, no one benefits, and the losers are those who are trying to get into hospital, because beds are blocked by people who cannot get into care homes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an extremely important point. Despite what the Minister has said on several occasions, there is an acute problem in that sector, as my hon. Friend and I have noted from firsthand experience in our constituencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have faced opposition from no less a person than the previous Secretary of State for Health and from many Government Back Benchers who are deeply unhappy with the proposals. For once, the troops are fighting back, which is remarkable given that we have seen for so long a quiescent Back-Bench reaction to and adulation for everything that the Prime Minister does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Government seem to be set on increasing and enhancing the role of the private sector in health care for NHS patients, it is important to require the best standards to ensure that all our constituents receive the highest quality health care. However, I should like to clarify several issues with the Minister and ask her to think again about one or two aspects of the regulations that I find incomprehensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As is my responsibility as an Opposition Member, I have been in touch with several organisations and companies, including Aculight, a leading provider of intense pulse light hair removal treatments. It is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0032">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
concerned, as am I, about the consultation process that took place before the publication of the regulations. Under regulation 3(1)(b), intense light will be included in the licensing and inspection regime. I understand that before July 2001, during the various consultation processes that preceded the publication of the regulations, operators of intense light machines were precluded from the consultation process, so they were unable to express their views and concerns about what the Government were doing in regulation 3.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the related debates that took place in another Delegated Legislation Committee yesterday, the Minister brushed off the issue of the consultation process when it was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald). When the Department's officials were confronted with concerns about the consultation process they responded:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Department took the decision to include intense light following advice from a large number of people in the field that intense light was intrinsically as dangerous as lasers if used inappropriately on the eyes and surrounding tissues."</p></blockquote>
My understanding is that the Minister made exactly the same point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many things are a danger to eyes if used inappropriately, but that is not the issue here. Aculight and other companies do not argue that there are no risks and they are not against sensible regulation. The issue remains that the Government failed to consult the industry once those with a vested interest raised the issue of intense light treatments. If there had been further consultation on regulating this business area we would not be facing the current problems and complaints. If the consultation process had been more widespread and relevant, those operators would have had the opportunities to which they were entitled to express their concerns. They could have advanced their arguments why it was ridiculous to regard their businesses as independent hospitals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be extremely helpful if the Minister could explain the reasons for the apparent exclusion of the operators from the consultation process and why it was so one-sided. Any reasonable person would accept that a genuine and productive consultation process must include all the interested parties from the beginning. I am also concerned as to why this company and others that supply intense light machines cosmetic hair removal to spas, beauty salons and health clubs will be classified as an independent hospital. That seems rather surprising and is taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure why the Government believe that such companies should be classified as independent hospitals, and I am sure that the Minister is aware that companies such as Aculight sell machines for aiding hair removal, usually for females. The intense pulse light system of filtered light is simply a convenient and painless alternative to electrolysis. It does not seem logical to classify premises that supply that beauty treatment as independent hospitals with all the bureaucratic and additional financial burdens that that entails.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
I suspect that for a number of reasons, not least the fact that the Government have a majority in the Committee, the Government will not be prepared to withdraw the order and think again or to consider amending it to meet those concerns. However, I ask the Government, even at this late stage, whether they are prepared to look again at the designation of intense light as a technology of an independent hospital. If the Minister were prepared to give an assurance to the Committee that this will be reviewed at the earliest possible moment, it would be a major step forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have concentrated my remarks on the interests of the company or companies involved in this type of beauty care. However, I accept that patients' interests must also be considered and protected. It would be foolish simply to look at it from the aspect of the companies supplying the equipment or carrying out the treatment, but in taking into account the interests of patients, which must be at the forefront of our minds, we must consider whether the Government have got the balance right in what they seek to do. In theory, there could be unnecessary regulation of every activity in the economy because of the systems in place at present. There would be a danger from the customers' and from the companies' point of view if there were regulation where it was not absolutely necessary, because there is not a problem carrying out this beauty treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will explain the reasons behind the proposal, respond to the matters of concern that I raised and assure us that she is prepared to reconsider the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.46 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Shaw	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chatham and Aylesford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, received the brief sent to the hon. Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns). Perhaps it was the only brief that came through his letterbox, as it is all that he talked about. He spoke with great passion, but all hon. Members received that brief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So that the hon. Gentleman does not suffer under a misapprehension, I can assure him that my speech is not based simply on a brief that I received in the post in the past three months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman could have fooled me. The hon. Gentleman spoke about intense pulsed light hair removal; I was bitterly opposed to hair removal for at least 15 years and when I first read the brief I thought that was what it was about. Then I read on and found that it was about the treatment of hair loss, of which I am obviously in favour. Perhaps I misread the document, but if my hon. Friend the Minister had told me that the Government were about to introduce treatments for hair loss, we would see eye to eye on everything and I would offer to deliver leaflets in her constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter is important, as there has been an escalation in the number of people having cosmetic surgery, skin treatments and procedures to enable them to change their features. We have seen too many cases in our newspapers in which such procedures have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0033">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
gone wrong and perhaps constituents have come to see us at our surgeries seeking redress and wanting to know why no one is regulating the area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given that the hon. Gentleman raised the point, will he tell the Committee how many constituents have been to his surgery since 1997 making complaints about this specific beauty treatment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the specific skin treatment, I did not say that I had received—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaw</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not. The hon. Gentleman may care to check the record. [	<i>Interruption</i>.] If the hon. Gentleman packs up his sedentary prevaricating, I will tell him that constituents of mine have sought removal of marks from the skin and found the treatment unsatisfactory. That happened. I shall not go into detail about this case, which would be particularly sad if it involved a child. I speak from some experience based on my constituents' cases. Treatments have expanded and more services are available, but we also know that things sometimes go wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman spoke about sensible regulation, which people expect as the industry expands to meet demand. We need built-in safeguards. I hope to hear from my hon. Friend the Minister that consultation has taken place. Of course it is right to hear the views of people involved in the industry, but I also hope that she sought the views of people who have suffered long-term and damaging effects from these services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the regulations, but I also seek clarification and reassurance from my hon. Friend the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.51 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Evan Harris	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Oxford, West and Abingdon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate. I listened carefully to the hon. Member for West Chelmsford who spoke about communing with the private sector in the delivery of health care. We then heard a debate about the appropriateness of the regulations on hair removal equipment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some even more important issues must be addressed. First, will the Minister clarify the meaning of the regulations with respect to a couple of provisions that are difficult to follow unless one is familiar with the Health and Social Care Act 2000, which amended the National Health Service (Primary Care) Act 1997? What is meant by the reference in regulation 4 to the meaning of "independent clinic"? It is clear from regulation 3 that independent clinics will be exempt from classification as independent hospitals under the regulations. I am not clear about the prescription in regulation 4: are walk-in centres to be regulated under the NHS even if they treat private patients? Private companies have set up some innovative schemes at railway stations. Would they be classified?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
Will the hon. Lady explain paragraph 4 of regulation 3, which adds to section 2(7) of the amended 1997 Act? Cosmetic surgery is defined, but ear and body piercing, tattooing and other aspects are exempted from it. Does that mean that those aspects will not be covered by the regulations? Concerns have been raised on both sides of the House about the inadequate regulation of body piercing, especially in respect of young people or those whose ages are not clear. The same applies to tattooing. Are we not missing an opportunity here?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may be aware of articles over the last few days in the 	<i>Financial Times</i> about the behaviour of anaesthetic specialists on fee setting. It is alleged that anaesthetists providing services in the private sector are operating as a cartel, artificially raising prices—outrageous at worst, and at best failing to provide the transparency that a proper market requires. That is the best interpretation of this alleged behaviour and it greatly concerns insurance companies who procure these services and, indeed, patients who are faced with a higher bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister tell the Committee what arrangements the Government are making either within regulations or, if that is not appropriate, around the issue to ensure that once the Office of Fair Trading investigation is complete such practice is made more difficult? Clearly, she cannot be held responsible for the actions of private specialists, but we must create a climate in which such behaviour is made more difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was alleged that patients are being presented with a bill directly by the anaesthetist at the time of preoperative assessment. As the 	<i>Financial Times</i> said, it is pretty difficult for a patient who is about to go under the knife to quibble over the price with the anaesthetist when they are first presented with the bill the night before the operation. The tradition is that anaesthetists bill the patient directly, rather than as part of an entire price negotiated by the private sector, which would be more sensible. Regulation 7 concerns the patients guide, to which the 	<i>Financial Times</i> referred, and paragraph (1)(b) states that the guide shall include
	<br><blockquote><p>"the terms and conditions in respect of services to be provided for patients, including as to the amount and method of payment of charges for all aspects of their treatment".</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister clarify where it is provided that the guide is given to the patient well in advance of their pre-operative assessment? One cannot blame the anaesthetists for operating in the current system, but it is inappropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The policies and procedures in regulation 9 discuss consent, but I cannot see any paragraph that provides that consent should be obtained by the surgeon who performs the procedure. That is established good practice, and it would not do any harm to specify that in the regulations. It is normal practice in the private sector, where there are fewer tiers of junior doctors than in the national health service, and such a move would be important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 9(3)(d) provides that
	<br><blockquote><p>"information about a patient's health and treatment is disclosed only to those persons who need to be aware of that information".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0034">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
Will the Minister confirm what the limit of that is in relation to marketing and the provision of information? Could the information that a patient has had a treatment in a hospital be passed to a third party or another division of either the provider or commissioner—the insurance company—in order to send more information about other possible treatments? One can see the commercial opportunities and the wish to market directly to people who have used such services, but if a patient were identified as having a treatment in a specialist clinic, it would be a giveaway. Even without going to clinical details, one can usually work out what the problem is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations do not mention hours of work for staff. The Minister will know that there are broadly two provisions under the NHS. Standards are set out by what was called the new deal for junior doctors, although it is rather an old deal now. That sets specific limits not only on the total hours of work, which will be reduced further by European regulation, but on maximum shift lengths depending on the intensity of the work. The regulations do not seem to contain any provision to prevent hospitals from deploying junior doctors—they will usually be not training-grade doctors but resident medical and surgical officers—for long shifts that will run beyond the 24-hour limit that applies to the least intense work. That should be provided for. If it is unacceptable in the NHS for a junior doctor, even in a less hard-pressed specialty, to be on call for what is known as a long weekend, from Friday to Monday, I do not see why that should be allowed in the private sector. We know that tired doctors, particularly those who are junior, make more mistakes or take longer to avoid making mistakes. Indeed, as I know, several have managed to take longer in making mistakes. That appears to be a serious omission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will be aware of the provision on the maximum working week for specialists covered by European legislation. Will that apply not only to the more junior staff who will be resident on call in many independent hospitals, but to the specialist staff? Will independent hospitals be required to comply with that duty?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 17 is remarkably short. It is entitled
	<br><blockquote><p>"Review of quality of treatment and other services".</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>It is surprising if the provision that relates to the duty of audit in NHS hospitals can be summed up in eight sentences for independent hospitals. The argument is that where patient choice exists it is a driver to the publication of more information on outcomes, which enables choice to be more informed. However, I am not sure that the degree of audit will be what some of us want without a firmer requirement that specifies the sort of clinical audit that should take place.</p></blockquote>
Under regulation 19, there is a question about the fitness of workers, and regulation 18 contains provisions about staffing. Does the Minister think it appropriate to specify in regulations a duty on such employers to abide by the regulations that apply to public authorities under the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000.1 may have missed that, but I do not think that it is there. I am talking about making
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
it clear that if a requirement were placed on staff to hold certain qualifications before being employed, which indirectly discriminated against staff from certain ethnic minorities who might find it more difficult to comply with, that would be a breach of the duty. That is a problem in medical practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have drawn the attention of the Minister's colleagues to a problem with the granting of certificates of completion of specialist training. It would not surprise me if certain posts in private hospitals were held open for Australian or white Commonwealth doctors to practise as clinical fellows or something similar, and that would reduce options for people from other ethnic minority backgrounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, these are extensive regulations. I echo the comments of the hon. Member for West Chelmsford, who spoke for the Conservative party. In a "take it or leave it" Standing Committee such as this, we do not have amendable regulations as we would like.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not been able to lay my hands on a copy of the report of the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments. I was informed by the authorities that it had not yet been printed, but I understand that the hon. Gentleman was able to get a copy, so that is a little frustrating. He says that the Committee criticised the regulations for not being properly drafted. As they are so extensive, will the Minister assure us that there will be an adequate opportunity to review their operation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Peter Bottomley	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Worthing, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that we are taking the two sets of regulations separately. When we reach the second set, I shall ask some questions about adult placements and consultation responses. On these regulations, I shall go through four points in reverse order. Regulation 41 requires the notification of terminations. Given that relatively few places are licensed for terminations and as the number of terminations has to be notified, it would be a good idea for the Department to consider publishing reasonably up-to-date figures—every month or every quarter—on the number of terminations in the country. I do not ask for publication of the figures for each establishment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Health</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> (Jacqui Smith): I may have misheard the hon. Gentleman. I think that he said that regulation 41 referred to termination of regulations. Does he mean termination of pregnancies?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I misled myself. Regulation 41 is headed "Termination of pregnancies". I was addressing the point about the number of pregnancies that are terminated. The information from independent and NHS clinics makes the number of terminations available to the health authority. That information should be published every month or every three months, so that it becomes as current as the information about the bank interest rate, the rate of change of retail prices or the number of people out of work who are claiming benefit. The plain
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0035">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
truth is that 6,000 people a week in this country contribute to the avoidable distress and disadvantage of terminating pregnancies deliberately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to argue about the law on terminations, but we have a choice when we are sexually active of realising only afterwards that we have conceived or deciding beforehand about contraception. We should get away from the rather useless idea that arguing about the law, telling people to "say no", birth control or family planning will make a significant difference. We should be able to cut the number of terminations in this country from 3,000 to about a quarter of that figure, if people become more aware and more grown up, whatever age they are—40, 30, 20 or in their teens—about what is going on. We miss the opportunity of putting out information. If we had information on unemployment only a year and a half after the figures were counted, we would pay far less attention to unemployment. I make a plea to the Minister to arrange for the information to be more current so that the rest of us, whether we are part of the media or the public, start to pay more attention. I do not condemn anyone who chooses an abortion, but I believe that many more people would like not to have to make that choice because they have been more grown up about their activity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Debra Shipley	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stourbridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to the Conservative spokesman, who clarified the Opposition's position, and I was not drawn to the conclusion that they are in favour of sex education in schools—quite the reverse. Education, most probably in schools, is the key to the issue. We must catch people early. Does the hon. Member for Worthing, West (Mr. Bottomley) agree, and will the Conservative spokesman confirm the Opposition's view?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady makes an interesting point. However, the greatest number of terminations occur among people in their 20s, 30s, and 40s. It clearly will not work to expect them to remember a lesson that they had when they were 15, although that could be a useful contribution. What matters is that people of whatever age and circumstances can discuss these issues openly and make choices, rather than experience the embarrassment that too many people have to experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 28—notification of events—refers to the death of, or serious injury to, a patient. Will the Minister assure the Committee that the death of, or serious injury to, a member of staff is covered by the usual health and safety at work regulations? Will she confirm that those deaths and injuries matter as much, and that the regulation is just a way of including those who are not members of staff, whose death or serious injury would otherwise not be reported? If the Minister does not have an immediate answer to that question, I do not mind a written response. I should have given her notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) made a point about fitness of workers. What happens to someone who has been disqualified or has suffered a penalty in a different jurisdiction? That applies especially to doctors, but it might apply equally to nurses. When they come to work in this country, is there any requirement for them to declare to the relevant registering authority that an event should properly be taken into consideration, whether they are registered or not? If they do not have to do that, I would be grateful if the Minister would give the matter consideration. I do not wish to chase the hard case in the north-east that has been in the papers, but it seems relevant to ask about previous events, as one might if someone were applying for a driving licence and had recently been disqualified in another country. Is information available that would help determine whether authority to practice can be given?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last point that I wish to raise is about regulation 16 on the care and welfare of patients. The issue will come up again under the adult placement part of the next order. What powers do the people who run an establishment have to ensure that patients take medication, which may be one of the reasons why they are able to live in the community, or to strongly encourage them to do so? I am thinking particularly of people with mental illness, but the question might apply to someone with physical illness. Is it all right for an adult patient to decline to follow their prescription, which may be part of the reason why they are not in hospital? Can those who run the establishment do nothing in such a case?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must face the problem, although it may come up rarely. Most mental illnesses are no more incapacitating than most physical illnesses; they exist, but should not worry anyone else in particular. However, in some cases, people are freer and more a part of society if they take the drugs that have been prescribed to improve their condition. If people around them learn that that they are not taking their medication, can the situation be reviewed to determine whether it is appropriate for them to remain in society, in a clinic or in one of the hospitals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.11 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Michael Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is extraordinary that the Office of Communications Bill, a thin document, is being debated for four days in Committee, but we are discussing an order with 51 regulations and 4 schedules—a somewhat larger document—as a statutory instrument under the Care Standards Act 2000. So much legislation now involves secondary legislation, which can be rubber-stamped, as the regulation undoubtedly will be today, and which can be discussed for a maximum of 90 minutes on a take-it-or-leave-it basis, as my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, West said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the problems with the regulations, apart from the fact that my hon. Friend the Member for Colchester—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: West Chelmsford—"Essex man."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0036">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Michael Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford—Essex man—has pointed out that many of us have not received the documentation, so it is difficult to make a judgment. However, I wish to pick up on several points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I, too, am concerned about the lack of information in the order about hours of work. The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon spoke about Government initiatives to control the hours of junior doctors working in the national health service, yet we all know that they are not effective. The issue has been omitted completely from the statutory instrument. How does the Minister intend to ensure that junior doctors—as well as senior doctors—who are employed by private hospitals are not worked to such a degree that their attention span is affected?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many regulations, but they are vague. In some ways, that may be a good thing—they will not drive hospitals out of business. On the other hand, they may lead to great uncertainty, which would be equally dangerous. For example, there are provisions about fitness for use of rooms, including sleeping facilities not only for patients but for staff—including, presumably, junior doctors—but there is no definition of fitness for use. Should the rooms be quiet, to enable people to sleep? Should they have windows and adequate ventilation? I do not have to go through the list. There seems to be such an empty vagueness in so much of the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 10 deals with the fitness of registered providers. Paragraph (3) states that the registered provider is required to be 	<br><blockquote><p>"of integrity and good character".</p></blockquote>
What are the definitions of integrity and good character? Regulation 10(3) is almost like a wish list. Of course we want someone of integrity and good character, but there is no definition of that in law, and no closer definition in the regulations. If the registered provider has a conviction, does that mean that he or she is not of integrity and good character? That clearly depends on the type of conviction and the maximum sentence for the offence. The same definition is used in regulation 12, which deals with the fitness of registered managers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I anticipate what the Minister will say. The Opposition welcome regulations that ensure that managers and providers are of integrity and good character, and we want to see higher standards. There is no point, however, in providing a list of standards that are so vague that they create uncertainty and deter organisations from being set up or from continuing to operate, or provide massive loopholes before the Committee has passed the legislation. There must be greater clarity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 19 deals with the fitness of workers, and contains another wish list. Paragraph (2)(c) states that he or she should be
	<br><blockquote><p>"physically or mentally fit for that work".</p></blockquote>
Again, who will be the arbiter of that? Will the Minister outline what system of inspection there will be to ensure that a person is physically and mentally fit for that work? Does the word "workers" include the health care professions? Does the Minister agree that
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
the criteria should also apply to the quality of doctors and other medical professionals employed in the United Kingdom who are not UK nationals—a point that was also raised by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon? I refer especially to the quality of doctors' medical training and language skills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister knows, as I do, that in theory the British Medical Association, the General Medical Council and other organisations test English language skills, but we will have heard of incidents in our constituencies of patients being unable to communicate adequately with doctors who do not have a good grasp of English. Does that mean that such a person is physically and mentally fit to carry out that sort of work?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a dreadful shame when a document of 31 pages must be accepted or rejected in full—take it or leave it. It makes a mockery of parliamentary scrutiny and of this Government when they say that they care about public health in the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.19 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jacqui Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a wide-ranging debate, and I shall start by setting the context for our discussion, particularly in response to the hon. Member for Lichfield (Michael Fabricant). He pointed out that the regulations stem from the considerable debate given to the Care Standards Act 2000, which laid down the principles of, and much of the detail for, the basis of the statutory instruments of which the regulations are part. The regulations have been subject to considerable public consultation, so, given that consultation and parliamentary scrutiny, his arguments are slightly specious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important point is that we are discussing the implementation of a modernised and improved regulatory framework. It is worth considering briefly a comparison with the current position. Regulation of those independent and private health care providers who are regulated occurs largely under the Registered Homes Act 1984, which does not provide local authorities with any powers to inspect or assess the quality of the treatment or services provided. Inspections focus on the state of the premises, facilities and staff qualifications and numbers, and managers and owners are not held to account for the treatment provided in their establishments. They merely facilitate the provision of treatment by medical practitioners, to whom they grant practising privileges, and it is the medical practitioners alone who contract with the patient. That partly relates to the question about anaesthetists which was raised by the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon, but I shall return to that later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new system will bring a radical change to the regulatory framework for independent and private health care. Managers and owners of establishments will now be held responsible for the quality of the treatment provided and will have to have policies and procedures for clinical audit. The hon. Member for Lichfield asked who would do the inspection and how we could determine the integrity of the provider. The context of our debate is the regulations against which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0037">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
the National Care Standards Commission will inspect and regulate when it begins operating in April. There we have the arbiter. Yesterday we considered issues concerning the registration of providers and their fitness. Both the regulations and standards that underpin them contain a lot of detail about what considerations the people who carry out the inspections will have to bear in mind in relation to the integrity, character and other necessities of the provider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important point is that we now have, in a way we never had, a requirement for private and voluntary health care providers to put in place some overarching policies on clinical audit that consider the benefits of the patient. My hon. Friend the Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Mr. Shaw) made an important point about the extent to which patients who were dissatisfied with their treatment have not had any redress. That is an important objective of the new regulatory framework. Through channels such as the complaints procedures and the necessary statements of purpose, patients will have much more redress. I shall return to standards and regulations in a few minutes, but want to move on to more specific issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Chelmsford referred to the report of the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments. It is not true that the report drove a coach and horses through these regulations. The Committee made a valid but limited point about the extent to which regulation 51 was contradictory with respect to regulations 14 and 29. The problem arose because regulations 14 and 29 lay down specific duties that must be complied with, whereas regulation 51 allows a more flexible approach for providers to explain the extenuating circumstances that brought about particular offences. The later regulations were introduced precisely because we wanted to provide such flexibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can give the Committee my assurance, as I said yesterday, that we will examine how best to amend the regulations to make them more effective in dealing with offences. That is a relatively narrow aspect of the statutory instrument. Opposition Members may want to make more of it, but I can assure members of the Committee that the objectives and the details of the regulations stand unblemished and will fulfil the purposes that we set for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully understand the Minister's desire to gloss this over as a minor technicality, but let me read a brief extract from the 16th report. Paragraph 3 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It was unclear to the Committee how the provisions of regulation 11 could be applied to a contravention of regulation 10 given that, once the specified day was past, compliance is no longer possible."</p></blockquote>
That is not a minor problem; it goes to the heart of enforcing compliance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jacqui Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman now refers to registration regulations that were covered yesterday, but the point remains the same. It is about the extent to which we allow flexibility in the regulations. I am not
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
attempting to gloss over it. I am explaining the reasonable objectives set by the Government and the action necessary to ensure that they are met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us move on to intense pulsed light. Members of the Committee will be aware that intense pulsed light was not developed until after the Registered Homes Act 1984, which regulates class 4 laser technology. Around 1996, the Department began to receive letters from medical practitioners, radiation experts, laser providers and manufacturers urging us to remove the anomaly whereby only class 4 lasers were regulated and intense pulsed lights were not. In fact, we received more correspondence about intense pulsed lights than about any other independent health care issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In November 2000, the Department wanted to approach the intense pulsed light industry about the proposal to bring it into the scope of regulations. Precisely because it is not regulated, we have no direct contacts with the industry, so officials wrote to several trade associations representing people in the beauty industry and other organisations that might have connections with lasers or intense pulsed lights. The organisations that we approached included the Hairdressing and Beauty Industry Authority, four other cosmetic or beauty-related organisations, and associations of electrolysis practitioners, dermatologists and ophthalmologists. We received only a handful of replies, saying that they either agreed with the proposal or would consult their members and respond, but few contacted the Department with the views of their members. When the formal consultation began in July 2001, we had a good response from consultant physicists, health authority inspectors, laser protection advisers and laser service providers, among others. Bodies that welcomed the proposals include laser and IPL manufacturers and distributors, the Hairdressing and Beauty Industry Authority and the Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been discussion about whether it is as important to regulate intense light as other laser technologies. The Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine set up a working group on the private use of lasers and intense light sources on the human body. The institute is an independent professional body that comprises experts in laser technology, medical physics, photobiology, imaging and radiation. It concluded that it was appropriate to regulate intense pulsed light as the Government propose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Chatham and Aylesford expressed his views on hair removal in general—I must say that he is perfect as he is, and does not need improvement from any source—and pointed out that what we are hearing is an understandable lobby from manufacturers and providers of equipment. It is right to weigh up those concerns, as the Government have done, against the considerable concerns expressed by a variety of professionals and users who think that the regulation is appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Chelmsford suggested that we intend that the providers of intense pulsed light treatment should have to act like private hospitals. We are certainly not trying to regulate them in that way. We are classifying them as independent hospitals in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0038">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
order to bring them under the Care Standards Act. For the purposes of regulation, the term "independent hospital" is defined in that Act, just as countless other terms have particular interpretations in other Acts. They will be only registered, not regulated, as independent hospitals. They will not, for example, have to incorporate the word "hospital" in the name of the establishment and they will not have to meet the acute hospital national minimum standards. They will have a unique set of service-specific standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings us to another important distinction that should be made. We are considering the regulations for private and voluntary health care providers. The regulations set the high-level, overarching rules that must be complied with by law. However, in response to the hon. Members who raised detailed issues, we have also developed a range of service-specific standards, and standards that address overall issues about the management and provision of private and voluntary health care, which go into more detail than it would be appropriate for the regulations to do. Those standards have been developed in consultation with, alongside, and in some cases by stakeholder groups to ensure that they address important detailed issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm one or two points? Am I right in believing that between April 2000 and July 2001, when informal consultations on the regulations took place, the Department chose to consult only a limited reference group, the membership of which was determined by the Department of Health? Will she also say whether the Department of Health has admitted that it failed adequately to consult the major companies that supplied intense light machines for cosmetic hair removal, and that her officials attempted belatedly to include them by seeking their views after the formal consultation? Will the Minister also say whether Lord Haskins intervened on their behalf with the Department?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jacqui Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I spelled out what action the Department took in 2000 to attempt to make contact with representatives of the IPL industry. Because the industry was not regulated, it was necessary to try a range of different groups to make contact with them. I outlined the significant range of responses that we received in the formal consultation, most of which supported the Government's regulatory approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord Haskins passed representations from Aculight to the Department, which were used with other representations as part of the consultation. My understanding is that the Department made it clear to Aculight that that was the point. The difficulty may be that Lord Haskins did not receive a copy of that letter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I showed that the Department rightly took considerable pains to consult the industry. It had already received a large number of representations suggesting that it was appropriate to regulate intense pulsed light as I described. I gave some reasons as to why that was appropriate. We are trying to put in place appropriate safeguards for the use of technologies that
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
people believe may cause damage if used inappropriately. The Department acted correctly, and the policy objective is right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, is it right or wrong to say that the Department of Health has admitted that it failed adequately to consult the major companies supplying intense light machines for cosmetic hair removal? Secondly, is it right to say that officials at the Department belatedly attempted to consult them after the formal consultation process had finished? Thirdly, as a result of Lord Haskins's representations or passing on information to the Department, has it had the courtesy, through Ministers, to respond to Aculight?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jacqui Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I answered the last point. [	<i>Interruption</i>.] I did answer it. If I am wrong, I will certainly correct myself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I also responded to the first two points. I made it clear that we received quite a lot of responses in the formal consultation. I understand that officials in the Department sought to meet the manufacturers as a result of their comments, which was appropriate. Today's debate and the extent of the contact suggest that there was significant consultation. Some providers may not like the results of the consultation, but for the reasons I outlined, it is appropriate that the Government have acted as we have to safeguard users of intense pulsed light.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I do not manage to cover particular points that were raised, I shall write to hon. Members, but as I said, many issues are covered in the standards. It is appropriate that they are laid down in the standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon asked about regulation, particularly of walk-in centres. Those establishments regulated as independent clinics are private establishments only, so to the extent that they are private walk-in centres, they are regulated. Those clinics that provide NHS services, whether wholly or partially, will not be independent clinics for the purpose of the regulations. On regulation 3(4), the hon. Gentleman is right: the issues to which he referred are exempted in this case. The procedures are not covered by the legislation. Given the overall objectives of the regulations, this would not have been the appropriate place to deal with issues such as body piercing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also made a point about anaesthetists. The problem is the responsibility of the Competition Commission and the Office of Fair Trading, as I believe he suggested. Other issues that the hon. Gentleman raised—the presentation of bills, the process of gaining consent and the provision of information—are covered in the standards that underpin the regulations. We must have consistent standards, and inspection of establishments will be done on the basis of ensuring that standards are met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman made a point about the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000; I shall write to him about that. The regulations emphasise the responsibilities of establishments as employers. Rightly, they will have to follow employment legislation on race discrimination.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0039">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
The hon. Member for Worthing, West raised a point about terminations. Not only is monitoring of terminations not a good use of regulations, but it is not appropriate in the legislation. I believe that the hon. Gentleman made the point, taken up by my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge (Ms Shipley), that we need action to ensure that the number of terminations is minimised. The Government's teenage pregnancy strategy, the guidance to schools on sex and relationship education and the expansion of access to contraceptives and contraception advice are more important than monitoring in reducing the number of terminations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not challenge the Minister, but she may wish to reflect on the requirements for notifying the chief medical officer of each termination. I believe that that is a requirement on national health service hospitals. I hope that she will give further consideration to my suggestion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jacqui Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly undertake to consider it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the hon. Gentleman's point about staff, they will be covered by health and safety regulations, as he suggested. The issue of disqualification also relates to doctors from abroad, who must register with the General Medical Council. Through the regulations, we will be able to ensure that providers and employers check references and carry out the sort of recruitment practices that we expect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was not completely clear about the hon. Gentleman's comments on medication. I believe that he was concerned about the extent to which medication for patients in the community might be enforced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or in an independent clinic, which was a way of getting it into the discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jacqui Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is very honest. It would probably be more appropriate to consider the issue in a discussion of the Government's commitment to introducing new mental health legislation, particularly for modernising compulsion for treatment in the community. However, the hon. Gentleman managed to ask the question, and I managed to respond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have responded to the points made by the hon. Member for Lichfield.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the Minister's reply to my questions, but she did not respond to the following points: first, she said that the regulations would not deal with tattooing and body piercing, but she did not say whether the Department had a plan to deal with the issue; secondly, I want to know if she thinks that paragraph 17 on audit is adequate; thirdly, and most importantly, can she assure me that resident surgical and medical officers will not be expected to work longer shifts than those of junior hospital doctors with the same experience in the NHS, which are required to be limited?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jacqui Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not answer the hon. Gentleman's specific questions, but I shall write to him. Several of the issues he raised are covered in the standards that underpin the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify what she said? Is there a published standard that specifies, for example, that resident surgical officers and resident medical officers will not be required as part of their contract of employment to work long shifts in excess of the standards in the national health service that apply to junior hospital doctors of the same experience?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jacqui Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is not a standard that explicitly states that. As I said, the standards underpin the type of employment practices and the expertise that would be expected in different clinics, and service-specific standards are being developed in respect of each of those. I explained the status of those standards; in relation to the particular points, I shall write to the hon. Gentleman about the extent to which they are covered in the standards. They are the basis on which the regulations are interpreted when private and voluntary health care establishments are inspected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to our objective: the regulations provide a far better way of ensuring that we monitor and regulate the appropriateness of premises or numbers of staff. They enable us to put the needs of patients, the importance of clinical standards and the extent to which we will be able to regulate and improve them at the heart of the regulation of private and voluntary health care providers. The measure should be welcomed as part of the Government's overall improvement and modernisation of regulation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</section>

	<div class='title'>CARE HOME REGULATIONS 2001</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>5.49 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Care Homes Regulations 2001 (S.I. 2001, No. 3965).</p></blockquote>
Given the nature of the proposal, I am slightly surprised that it should have been bracketed with the earlier measure. Fortunately, we can redress the balance by having a proper debate on what the Committee will agree is an important measure, considering what has happened in the past in care homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition welcome all improvements in standards of care, and the enhancements to the standards of protection that that entails for those who are resident in a care home, regardless of whether they are young adults—as is the case under these regulations—or a more elderly client group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that respect, we are at one with the Government. We share their goal of raising standards in the care home system throughout the country. However, that does not preclude us from having concerns about the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0040">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
details of certain matters, and from seeking an explanation and guidance from the Minister about them. I shall try to do that without unduly detaining the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a lengthy document that addresses many requirements, and the way that it is drafted occasionally causes confusion about its intentions. I am also concerned about certain provisions in which the Government appear to resort to their natural tendency to seek to over-regulate, and to nanny the system along. With regard to some of the regulations, it is not necessary for them to be so heavy handed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 19 addresses the fitness of workers. That is an important issue. Regulation 19(1) states that a person shall not be employed at a care home unless schedule 2 has been complied with—and, in particular, paragraph 7 of that schedule, which requires the criminal records bureau to carry out a criminal records check on people working in care homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In principle, that is an excellent provision, because it is essential that people with criminal records should not be employed in such a sensitive area. That is especially the case with regard to certain kinds of criminality that would have a devastating impact on clients, and on the smooth running of a care home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there is a flaw in the way those regulations will be introduced. They will come into effect on 1 April 2002, and the criminal records bureau will start operating at the end of March. Therefore, they will be introduced almost simultaneously. How will care homes be able to meet the requirements of the regulations from 1 April? The time scale is too tight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also understand that criminal records checks are expected to take from two to three weeks. That might be an optimistic forecast. It is not plausible to expect potential members of staff to wait that long, as they might be able to find employment elsewhere on the very day that they begin looking for work. I also wish the Government to clarify whether the criminal records checks will also be carried out on care staff in the national health service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A criminal records check will cost £12 a person. The care homes' administration costs must be added to that. That is another cost that independent sector providers will have to bear. It would be better to wait a week, obviously with the member of staff being closely supervised and presumably other references having been taken up with a former employer or other referee. We should allow a saving-grace time scale. An individual could decide after a few days and before the check had come through that that was not the job for him or her—with the employers still having to pay the fee for the criminal check because they would have had to put in motion the procedures for a criminal record check. However important the checks, it seems unfair to employers, given the cost involved, that criminal records must be checked from day one so that checks are run on people who may decide, long before the information comes back, that they do not want to work in the sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Shipley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would agree that police checks are vital. Given the thrust of his argument, who does he think should pay for them—the taxpayer through Government funding, the employer or the potential employee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a good point. I would follow the precedents laid down by the Government on checking in the voluntary sector. As the hon. Lady will remember, probably from pressure in her own constituency, there was much concern about the fees for checking people in the voluntary sector. The scout movement was particularly vociferous in lobbying us all on the financial implications of the fees to check people working in it. As the hon. Lady knows, I am not a cynic, but that happened in the run-up to the previous general election; having said that it was up to the voluntary sector to pay the fees, the Government rescinded at the last minute, before the election was called, and decided that the Government would pay them. There is a precedent for the Government paying for criminal checks on a certain group of people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Shipley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the hon. Lady would want to intervene on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Shipley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, not least because the most recent lobby was in connection with my Bill on the protection of children. If the Government are picking up the bill, the hon. Gentleman will realise that that means the taxpayer. So of the three groups I gave, his answer is the taxpayer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not answered the question; I was just giving the hon. Lady a precedent of where the Government, and to use her words "the taxpayer", were picking up the bill in the charity and voluntary sector. I recognise as much as she that a general election is not in the offing and that the Government would therefore be more reticent about the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I am right in saying that most of the people to whom the check would apply would be in catering or cleaning positions or be those giving other forms of assistance in the care home. It does not apply only to those with professional qualifications. I believe that, by the age of 30, a third of all men have been convicted of an offence for which they could have been sent to jail for six months or more. I hope that people do not have the notion that all criminal convictions disqualify people from working in a care home. The cost to the taxpayer and the public purse is far greater if people who could have been or were sent to jail for six months or more are denied employment in the sorts of fields where they could appropriately be employed. Were the taxpayer to pay £12 to get someone into work who would otherwise be on benefit, the taxpayer would gain significantly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an interesting point, to which I hope that the Minister will respond. To return briefly to the hon. Lady's point, let me say
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0041">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
that the measure will place a financial burden on care homes, particularly smaller ones, at a time when there are considerable other pressures on the sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, West made an interesting point, because the regulations do not distinguish between the different types of criminal record. It is dangerous to start evaluating the seriousness of criminal convictions and criminal records on a sliding scale, but we all live in the real world and we know that there are criminal records and there are criminal records, and some are infinitely more serious than others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third point relates to a group of individuals—they may be numerous, although we do not know, because we cannot quantify them yet—who start working in a care home and on whom, not unnaturally, a check must be made. Given the time scale for such checks, it is possible that such individuals may decide, before the results have become known, that they have made a mistake and do not want to work in that area. The care home owners will, however, still be charged a fee. Could the time scales be adjusted slightly to minimise that additional burden, which will fall on smaller care homes in particular?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening with interest to the hon. Gentleman, but I want to raise a point that he could factor in. Would it not be reasonable, in the interests of fairness, for private sector providers that compete for contracts with the state sector where there is no shortage—as there is now—of care home places to absorb the charges and to reflect them in their tenders, just as the state sector does? There would be an argument for the state sector to pick up the costs only where it imposed them on the private sector but not on its state sector competitors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes an extremely telling and valid point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 25 deals with the financial position. Regulation 25(2) sets out an exhaustive list of the documents that care homes must produce. The minutiae will have a considerable impact on smaller care homes, and I wonder whether the sheer plethora of information that will be required is absolutely necessary. I also wonder whether those who will carry out the inspections will fully understand what they are required to inspect. If the answer is no, why are the Government demanding such documentation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why does regulation 25(3)(c) require a care home to give a copy of its management accounts to an inspector on request? It would be interesting to know who the Minister expects to be the inspectors, but my understanding is that they are usually social workers or nurses. I wonder what sense they will make of the documents, given that their expertise and training are in nursing and social work, not in looking at management accounts, which can be technical and incomprehensible even for a Member of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
Furthermore, why does the commission need such sensitive business information, and what purpose do the Government think that it will serve? Who else is required by a Government agency—I am leaving aside the Revenue—to make such information available? Is this just another example of the Government inadvertently—I must be fair—placing a burden on an embattled sector because they have not thought matters through properly?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are the Government confident that there will be enough staff to carry out and monitor the inspections? If the answer is that they may have difficulties, or that there will not be enough initially, it begs the question of why the information is needed if no one is to look at it or do anything with it, particularly for the smaller homes. It seems rather unnecessary to collect the information, or at least part of it, simply for the sake of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clarification is important on a few further minor points, because it will highlight the complexities of such prescriptive and all-embracing regulations. For example, regulation 16(2)(k) states that a registered person shall keep the care home "free from offensive odours". No one here, including yourself, Mr. Cran, would wish there to be offensive odours in a care home or anywhere else, but could the Minister tell the Committee what is an offensive odour as defined in the regulations? Who will define it? How will it be enforced? What standard will be applied? Will there be discrepancies between homes and odours?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems quite extraordinary that something that most people would accept as common sense has to be laid down in a statutory instrument. It defies belief. I do not imagine that any legislation, either primary or more appropriately secondary, on the national health service and hospitals has laid down such a fatuous regulation as this. There is no definition of an odour, or of the degree to which an odour has to be offensive. I question whether it is sensible for even this Government, with their control freakery and their desire to interfere in the all the nooks and crannies of our lives, to start laying down such regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on his observation, if only because I was going to make it. I am somewhat disappointed that he got in first. Nevertheless, although one can see what the Government are getting at, the other senses are just as important as smell. One might say that the care home should be protected from offensive noises, sights, tastes and feelings. The regulation is bizarre.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: "Bizarre" is the right word. I am surprised that the Government have resisted the temptation to go down that route. They do not usually resist such temptations, and I am surprised that the list is not even longer. As the hon. Gentleman said, it could include noise and a list of other senses. My point is that none of them should be included. It is the nanny state gone mad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 37(1) provides in sub-paragraphs (c) and (d) that a person shall
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0042">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"give notice to the Commission without delay of the occurrence of … any serious injury to a service user … and serious illness of a service user at a care home at which nursing is not provided".</p></blockquote>
I would be interested to know the need for that, although I accept that there may be a valid need. What is a "serious illness" in such circumstances? To the best of my knowledge, there is no reference to that in the regulations. It depends on how wimpish the individual is. A common cold can be a serious illness to a hypochondriac.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jacqui Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To a man.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, that is amazing. Only because the Minister is female could she get away with that. I congratulate her on not being politically correct and on living in the real world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Cran. My hon. Friend's remarks will be recorded in the 	<i>Official Report</i>, but I am not sure that the Minister's will. Will she or my hon. Friend tell us what she said?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is very cruel. Because I congratulate the Minister on her honesty and on not being governed by political correctness, I shall leave the subject. What she said was fair, reasonable and sensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I digress, so I shall return to the subject of serious illness. Different people have different views of what a serious illness is. So far as I know—I may be wrong, in which case the Minister can correct me—it has no legal definition. Therefore, how is the provision enforceable if it depends on a matter of opinion about what a serious illness is?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations deal with care homes for youngsters and young adults. Again, the Minister can correct me if I am wrong—I would appreciate it if she did so now, as it would save her about three minutes and so be a considerable relief to her—but I think that they apply to people between the ages of 14 and 25.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can help my hon. Friend. Some of the regulations apply to that age group, but others including regulation 45 apply to adults.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that help, which confirms that some of the regulations deal with 14 to 25-year-olds. That is crucial, because in legal terms the crucial date is when someone turns 16. Some of the regulations deal with two client groups, 14 to 16-year-olds and 16 to 25-year-olds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jacqui Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can help the hon. Gentleman. The regulations apply to care homes for older people and younger adults, with a specific section for 16 and 17-year-olds. To that extent, they apply to care homes that accommodate people aged 16 and older.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely grateful to the Minister. So that there is no misunderstanding, let me ask this: Am I right to think that the regulations do not apply in any shape or form to homes in which there will be young children of 14 to 16?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jacqui Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They do not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend and to the Minister. That is extremely helpful, as it invalidates the point that I was about to make about the changeover and dual registration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier, the Opposition support any sensible and rational ways to raise standards in care homes, and to ensure that they provide the highest standards of care and give the maximum quality of life and dignity to those who live in them. I am concerned that some of the regulations seem incomprehensible in terms of how they can be defined and enforced, and also that they sometimes seem over-prescriptive and nannyish in stating what one can or cannot do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless there is good reason, I hope that the Minister will allay my fears on criminal records and the burdens that they will place on the aspect of social care that we are discussing. It provides vital care to several vulnerable client groups, despite the fact that she will never accept or admit the figures that show what goes on in the real world. During the past five years, that aspect of care has come under more and more relentless pressure. One would not want regulations designed to improve and enhance the quality of standards in care homes being taken too far and placing even more unnecessary and unacceptable burdens on them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Shipley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I broadly welcome the regulations, which are not before time. I welcome the immense detail that has been criticised by some. We need this sort of detail to protect fully vulnerable people. However, I want to raise a series of questions, and if the Minister cannot answer them now, I would be grateful to receive a written response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What monitoring of the procedures will be put in place? I note that the regulations will come into force on 1 April 2002, so there is some urgency about the matter. Who will carry out the monitoring, where will it be located, exactly how will it operate and through what channels will it be funded? In addition, when something goes wrong, what sanctions will exist for failure to comply and how will the operation of sanctions be phased in? Who will be responsible for implementing the sanctions and how will the monitoring of compliance with the sanctions take place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.16 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Liberal Democrats welcome the fact that we now have clear regulations for care homes, just as we supported the Act that set out the requirement for the regulations, which are long overdue. However, there are worries that the cost of compliance with some of the regulations, especially in the case of older premises, which are more difficult to amend in order to comply, may create huge financial burdens for some providers and further threaten the availability of care homes. I think that the Government realise what
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0043">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
difficulties they face in trying to strike a balance between suitable regulation and the need to ensure that there is adequate capacity in the care homes sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to raise a couple of specific points, the first of which relates to definitions. For the sake of previous and future discussions in other areas, I would be grateful for some clarification from the Minister. Regulation 2 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"references to 'spouse' in relation to any person include a former spouse and a person who is living with the person as husband and wife".</p></blockquote>
It would be helpful if the Minister could give some background or clearer definition of the expression
	<br><blockquote><p>"living with the person as husband and wife"</p></blockquote>
because, as she and her colleagues have previously said, people live in many different ways these days. Such people will have relatives living in care homes and it is not unreasonable to ask the Minister, as the publisher and writer of the regulations, to explain what she means by that because it must be interpreted by others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 5, on the service user's guide, includes a provision that was included in the previous regulations that we discussed. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The registered person shall produce a written guide to the care home … which shall include …</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(b) the terms and conditions in respect of accommodation to be provided for service users, including as to the amount and method of payment of fees".</p></blockquote>
The Minister may be aware—as I am aware from correspondence with constituents—of care home residents who have been presented, out of the blue, with an increase in fees, sometimes related to the provision of free nursing care. I would be interested to know if the Minister expects that such a service user's guide will specify whether there should be a minimum time with regard to increases in residents' charges. Many residents of care homes do not like moving, or they might find it difficult or upsetting; it can be argued that it could be damaging to the well-being of some residents. An untrammelled market could not, and should not, exist in this area, because there is, effectively, a captive customer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two issues are at stake. First, I want the Minister to clarify whether she expects there to be some protection against increases in charges for people who are paying for themselves. Secondly, because of the financial position that some care home users find themselves in, is it right that they should pocket the extra funding that the Government are providing for free nursing care?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not necessary to get into a debate about whether the amounts that are being provided are adequate, or about the issue of the funding of personal care. That is an issue of limited importance. The Minister might have heard the media coverage of it on Monday morning. She might have been unable to respond to it then, but I wish her to do so now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to regulation 16, which addresses the facilities and services that need to be provided. The hon. Member for West Chelmsford made a valid point about the details of the regulations. The same question
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
applies to the term "wholesome" in a discussion about food, as applied to the term "offensive" with regard to odours. Everyone understands what is "suitable" and "nutritious" food. The Minister probably thinks that she knows how "wholesome" refers to qualities that are not covered by "suitable" or "nutritious". However, I am unsure, in legal terms, what "wholesome" means that is not covered by "suitable" and "nutritious".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One might have thought that "sufficient" would be included as an adjective to describe food, because I could have a very small portion of suitable, wholesome and nutritious food. However, if it were inadequate in terms of calorific intake—I do not usually suffer that—I would be more concerned about that than about whether it was wholesome as well as nutritious. The Minister might wish to reconsider several of the adjectives that are—and are not—included in the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 16(3) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The registered person shall ensure that so far as practicable service users have the opportunity to attend religious services of their choice."</p></blockquote>
That is an understandable point; many residents of care homes will wish to participate in religious services. Many of them will also wish to participate in what 16(2)(m) describes as,
	<br><blockquote><p>"local, social and community activities".</p></blockquote>
However, many of them will also wish to participate in the democratic process. If anything needed to be specified, with regard to the requirement to ensure that there are adequate facilities for the engagement of residents so that they are not socially excluded, it should have been the provision for them to vote, in person if they wish to do so. That is as important as the provision to attend religious services, and to take part in community activities. Perhaps the Minister considers that that democratic right is included in the phrase,
	<br><blockquote><p>"local, social and community activities".</p></blockquote>
However, the political provision is so important, that it should be explicitly specified. I acknowledge that that opinion might be considered controversial, under certain circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I found the regulations difficult to understand, because the explanatory notes do not make it clear what age group they provide for. The hon. Member for West Chelmsford also found them difficult to understand. It would be helpful if the Minister would check with officials in her Department that they are capable of seeing the wood, rather than only the trees. I also wish them to recognise that, as some of us are approaching the regulations from the outside, it would be helpful if the explanatory note were longer than less than a page out of a 31-page document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The explanatory notes should make it clear which areas are covered, as we are dealing with a complex matter. If children's homes and homes that provide services for children under the age of 16 are not covered, a title that refers to children and young persons could be considered misleading.

Understanding the needs that people have to meet is not easy, consultations and analysing the responses to consultations is not easy and having to advise Ministers while hon. Members are asking questions cannot be that easy, either. I pay tribute to the Minister's advisers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I clear up one or two points, although in doing so I may perhaps make them more confusing? I quote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The provisions of this Part shall apply where any child is accommodated in the care home."</p></blockquote>
That means that it could apply to a child of any age. The complication is slight but significant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to address an issue raised by my hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford on regulation 19, which relates to "Fitness of workers." I refer to all those who work in care homes in regular employment, whether part time or not—although I leave aside those with trivial roles, such as delivering the milk. If a threshold exists for part-time employment that should be known about, I hope that all the relevant professional and trade magazines will be informed. Someone reading the regulation might think that it included the person who came in for three hours a week to do gardening. They might ask whether those people were covered by the criminal records check. In practical terms, it would be useful for that issue to be considered and the information to be given out, as regards both what the law is and what the regulations are intended to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Agency staff may be employed in a care home, but most of their work may not be in care homes. Assuming that the agency does not simply organise their work but is an employer, does it have an obligation to ensure that criminal checks are made? I may sound as if I am trying to think up difficulties, but these are practical issues that apply to a significant number of people who are involved in this area as part of their work, if not their mainstream work. I do not expect to receive a detailed answer today, and I apologise to the Minister for not having put those questions to her before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to regulation 45, which is in the miscellaneous section. When I was a junior Minister, I always found that those were the most interesting sections in terms of deciding what we were trying to do and discovering what the impact might be on others. I raise the question of adult placements, because several constituents have mentioned it to me. I should be grateful to the Minister if she dealt with the overall question, but particularly with the number of service users accommodated in care homes. A number of other items are of interest in that regulation, but that is the most interesting one of all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
I think I am right in saying that, if someone is caring for adults in their own home, they have up to now been able to have a higher number than three. A number of people will have to change their classification when the regulations come in, which specify that
	<br><blockquote><p>"no more than three service users are accommodated in the care home".</p></blockquote>
That will mean that a number of good, competent, experienced carers may find that they go out of business. If they have four people in their home at the moment, they will find that none will be able to continue with the accommodation and the care to which they have become used. Both the person making a living by providing care and the people receiving care will find their working lives, or their lives in general, disrupted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the situation now, before the regulations impose the limit of three? How was the point covered in the consultation? What was the response to the consultation, and what change has been made in the proposed regulations as a result of the consultation? If the Minister answers those questions, we can ask her if she can give us some estimate as to what the consequences will be, if I am right in thinking that the figure of three is lower than the one that we have had up to now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My subsidiary point may not be covered here, although I suspect that it is. An adult who is in a care home is expected to look after his own medicine. Up to now, the carer has been able to say that he will take control. However, if regulations—these or others— start saying that adults must be treated as if they can look after themselves and, therefore, their own medicine in the way that they are expected to look after their own money, are there issues on which the Minister may want to consult those who provide care within the domestic homes?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final comment—to which the Minister does not have to respond—concerns regulation 44, which strikes me as one of the most sensible regulations, and is concerned with where more than one person is registered. It states that if the requirement is fulfilled by one person, it does not have to be fulfilled by the others. That strikes me as a good bit of plain English that achieves its task, and I congratulate the Minister and those who work with her.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jacqui Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I start by giving the context of the standards. I am glad that there has been a general welcome in Committee for the need to set in place new regulations and minimum standards. The old system is riddled with anomalies, and existing regulations and standards for care homes are administered in many different ways by different authorities, and some homes are not regulated at all. The Care Standards Act 2000, these regulations and the standards that underpin them enable us to change that and provide some consistency to service providers. Perhaps most importantly, they enable us to put service user's interests at the heart of the regulatory system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0045">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
Committee members have not forgotten this today, but people sometimes do. We are talking about people's homes—the place where they live either temporarily or for many years. People who need residential services are entitled to as many as possible of the comforts of home life that the rest of us take for granted. The regulations and standards recognise that providers' and users' interests often overlap. Good, well-run homes should be allowed to carry on caring for their residents but, as in the national health service, we must ensure that the services are organised around the needs of the user and not the provider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must ensure that the standards are introduced in a way that both safeguards users and maintains good homes. That is why, after listening to the results of consultation, we made changes to the standards, putting off the environmental space standards until 2007 and ensuring that space could be used flexibly. I promised in the House to discuss with the National Care Standards Commission how it would undertake its regulation in a common-sense way. I have done that and announced today that we have issued statutory guidance to the NCSC to ensure that the application of the new standards does not close good quality care homes. The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon made a point about the architectural concerns that might prevent some environmental standards from being met. The guidance says that the commission should consider where the care homes could fulfil the needs of service users without making environmental changes. In other words, it puts the needs of the user at the centre of both the regulatory process and the way in which that process is interpreted by the NCSC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The guidance has been welcomed by the Registered Nursing Homes Association, the National Care Homes Association and the Independent Healthcare Association. We undertook to make available an information pack for registered care providers and a helpline to answer questions about how the national minimum standards will apply to their service, so that we can achieve the objective of assisting care home owners to raise standards, while providing them with the maximum information necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Chelmsford talked about a common-sense approach. Committee members may be interested to know that, in response to my discussions with the National Care Standards Commission, Anne Parker, who is its chair, wrote to me to outline the approach that it intends to take. In particular, she says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Our inspections will look to support and develop good practice. To this end, in our first year of operation we will be inspecting services, recording where they meet the standards, where they fail to do so and where they exceed the standards.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>We will be asking service providers to show us how they meet the intended outcomes for service users, which are set out in the standards.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>We will record their good ideas and take an holistic view of the service which is being provided. We will listen to the views of service users and discuss the improvements needed to meet the standards with service providers. Where providers do not meet the standards we will set priorities and timescales for action.</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>Where we find any circumstances that are harmful to service users we will act swiftly, using the powerful sanctions made available to us by Parliament.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The Board of the Commission wants to see good quality service provision. The national minimum standards do not imply lacklustre uniformity and we will be keen to promote innovative good practice where we find it."</p></blockquote>
I hope that that goes some way towards answering the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge about how we will conduct monitoring and ensure consistency. The standards in the regulations will form the basis of inspections by the National Care Standards Commission. As we discussed, care homes will need to be registered with the commission and will be inspected. Anne Parker's letter outlined the approach that it will take well. The commission has an important role to play in feeding information to the Government and the public about the quality of care providers that they inspect and regulate, and the extent to which standards impact on quality and capacity in the various sectors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Chelmsford made a number of points, some of which we covered yesterday, but we can reiterate and expand on them. Under the current framework, police checks are required on people seeking registration as providers or managers of services. Most local authorities also require such checks before staff commence employment in children's homes and other children's services. The new regulations require that criminal record checks be undertaken for all people working with vulnerable adults before they start work. That mirrors the position on people working with children and is linked to our policy on the protection of vulnerable adults.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the points made by the hon. Member for Worthing, West, let me say that all people who have contact with vulnerable service users must have an enhanced police check. That will include staff working as administrators, cooks and cleaners if they have contact with service users. Staff who do not have contact with service users must have a standard check. That will also apply to those who work part-time and agency staff. The important question is whether staff have contact with vulnerable adults. That is where we need to ensure that protection exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the current system, checks can take 12 weeks or more to be processed by local police forces. The Criminal Records Bureau will reduce that to 10 days for a standard check and to three weeks for an enhanced check. I am aware that some providers are concerned that the requirement will affect their ability to recruit staff, but we are committed to the principle that such checks should be undertaken before people provide intimate care to vulnerable adults. However, there is concern about the extent to which the Criminal Records Bureau will deliver the timings set out from the start. I reassure hon. Members that the Home Office advises us that it is confident that the CRB will be operational on 2 April. However, we have introduced transitional arrangements for providers, managers and staff in case of further delays to the commencement of the CRB. Additionally, existing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0046">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
staff in care homes will not be required to undergo checks until April 2003. Those are significant concessions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Shipley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I disagree; the concessions could be dangerous. I am disappointed that it has taken so long for the Criminal Records Bureau to be set up, although I understand the reasons why. I say that because of my association with the Protection of Children Act 1999, and legislation to protect vulnerable adults. The postponement of checks on existing members of staff until 2003 could border on negligence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jacqui Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I reassure my hon. Friend that the Home Office has reassured us that the CRB will be in place? However, it is precisely because we want to improve the current position that we are putting the necessary procedures in place, should there be transitional arrangements. For example, it will be necessary for more rigorous checks to be made on staff up to the commencement of the CRB, and up to April 2003.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall write to my hon. Friend to reassure her about the extent to which the new provisions from April will improve things for vulnerable adults. However, we may need to find transitional arrangements to overcome short-term issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am prepared to associate myself with the Minister's response. We must be practical and accept the responsibility that things may be discovered later that could have been discovered earlier, which was the point made by the hon. Member for Stourbridge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I refer the Minister to regulation 19(5)(a), which states that a person is not fit to work unless
	<br><blockquote><p>"he is of integrity and good character"?</p></blockquote>
There are several ways in which I could lose my character while not posing an additional threat to a vulnerable adult or a child in a children's home. For example, if I had been convicted of drink driving and I was disqualified from driving, I would be regarded as having lost my character. However, that would have nothing to do with whether I posed a threat to a person in a care home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that there will be guidance so that if a care home discovers that any of its employees have been convicted for an offence that is irrelevant to the vulnerability of the people in the home and that does not cause them to pose an extra risk, it will not start dismissing employees who should be able to continue with, or find, employment in a care home.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jacqui Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The important point about the Criminal Records Bureau is that it is the route of access to the registers for the protection of children and vulnerable adults. It is the important one-stop route to ensure that we identify people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I just want to make this absolutely clear. I, as an employee, could have a conviction that could be interpreted as meaning that I was not of good character, but no aspect of the conviction would mean that I posed an additional risk. If a registered person who ran a care home discovered that, I hope that
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
people would ensure that the registered owner of the care home would not dismiss me because of information that came from the police.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jacqui Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman does not have a speeding conviction. Clearly, some criminal convictions would not cause him to be a risk. The CRB has guidelines on such convictions, and the National Care Standards Commission will produce guidance on the extent to which factors may be risks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for saying that. The key words are in the regulations. They are "of good character", rather than of relevant good character. I hope that the Department, with the Home Office and others who are concerned with the employment of people with convictions will ensure that the new system does not cause an arbitrary impact. I think that that is generally understood. I shall not pursue the point further this afternoon but it is, to my mind, as important as protecting people from those about whom information is available to show that they should be disqualified from working in a care home.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jacqui Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made his point. Criminal record checks will have to be made in the NHS for prescribed services equivalent to those in the private sector for the protection of children and vulnerable adults.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Chelmsford raised the issue of financial viability, which we covered to some extent yesterday. Regulations require providers to demonstrate that they have the resources to ensure that the services that they intend to run can operate securely. As I explained yesterday, the regulations stem from the specific case of Regina 	<i>v</i>. Registered Homes Tribunal ex parte Hertfordshire County Council and a judicial review in the High Court, which was about the financial viability—both then and in the future—of an application for registration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The court ruled in favour of Hertfordshire, and made a clear statement that continuing financial viability was essential, and was an important issue about which regulators need to be able to make a judgment. We have tried to reflect that in the regulations. That is important as care homes, as hon. Members have said, provide for some of our most vulnerable people, who do not have the opportunity or desire to move. We must do everything that we can to ensure that the provision of those services is stable and viable in the long term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman made the point, also made by the NCSC, that we must provide the relevant documents. However, detailed documents need only be provided in a small number of cases. The NCSC headquarters' finance function will scrutinise documents of that nature when necessary. They will have staff to do that, and will bring in additional advice as necessary. Furthermore, inspectors will be required to assess compliance in a range of topics. Although they will mostly be social workers or nurses, they will receive training and will be supported by the NCSC financial team, who will teach them what to look for. That will be a core module on the new qualifications
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0047">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
for inspectors. The aim is not that they become accountants, but that they identify risk. If there is a concern, financial experts will be drawn in to further consider the details.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for West Chelmsford and for Oxford, West and Abingdon raised issues about the detail in regulation 16. Given that the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon then pushed for a range of things to be included in the regulations and made—quite rightly—extremely detailed points about what he felt should have been included in the previous regulations, it is a bit much for him to start criticising us for including too much detail. The important point about the regulation is that it makes it clear that the facilities and services available to users have to be at the heart of the provision made for them. It is appropriate that that is laid out in the regulation in a reasonably straightforward way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for West Chelmsford may wish to pursue the issue of some of the adjectives. Concern that sections of duties are missed out is not the same as believing that there is not enough detail. Those are two separate issues, and one can say that something is too detailed but still argue that there are whole sections of duties missed out which should be there. I still think that there are substantive questions to be asked about whether, notwithstanding the comments of the hon. Member for Worthing, West about the efforts of those who drafted the regulations, there was too much enthusiasm as to the detail in regulation 16.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jacqui Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will stand up long enough to give way to the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister be kind enough to tell the Committee what the legal definition of an offensive odour is?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jacqui Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, as is the case in any legislation, the regulations contain a range of terms for which there is no legal definition. I have already spelled out the common-sense approach that the National Care Standards Commission will take in implementing the proposals. I know what a bad smell is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So do I.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jacqui Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exactly. A common-sense approach will enable us to be clear that we expect people who provide homes to ensure that there are no bad smells in those homes. I do not like a bad smell in my house, and I do not believe that vulnerable and older people should have to live somewhere where there are bad smells either.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is right, which begs the question, why must we specify that in the regulations? It is so vague, and it is different for different people. For example, to some people the smell of curry is an offensive odour; to others it is not. Surely care home owners do not want to work, and possibly live, in an
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
environment with offensive odours. They do not need it to be specified in the regulations when legally the phrase is nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jacqui Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made his point, and I have made mine. An important part of the inspection and assessment will be asking users their views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also mentioned serious injury and illness. Action is required when a service user falls seriously ill in the home and the home cannot meet their needs. Injury might be related to falls or accidents with equipment, for example. The important point is the seriousness of the injury and whether the home can meet the person's needs. The regulations are enforceable if breached, and it is important that offences that affect service users' health and welfare are reported.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the points that I did not cover in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge was the funding of the NCSC. As we discussed yesterday, the funding will come partly from fees to be raised from providers and partly from money provided centrally by the Government. The cost of the NCSC in its first year is budgeted at about £134 million, of which approximately £30 million comes from fees, and the rest from central Government provision. The intention is to move to full cost recovery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked about the sanctions that will be available. Clearly, the way in which care standards inspectors determine sanctions will depend on the nature of the problem. As I said, in the event of difficulties that do not impact directly on users' safety, it will be important to take an approach involving appropriate action plans and time scales to put those problems right. In the event of danger to a service user, the NCSC has strong powers to cancel the registration and to take action against providers that do not meet the high standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon asked about the definition of relatives. The reference to people living together as husband and wife relates to people who are unmarried but cohabit as a married couple—in other words, are in a long-term relationship. The significance of that definition is that it is referred to in paragraph 13 of schedule 1, which relates to contact, and paragraph 11 of schedule 4, which relates to the record of complaints. "Relative" is defined in the Act, but that definition refers to the Children Act 1989, and is not appropriate for these regulations. We have therefore included that definition to cover circumstances in which contact with a relative is important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that that refers to unmarried couples. She uses the term "husband and wife". Am I to understand that it does not apply to couples of the same sex, who may have been living together for 20 years as a couple and, indeed, raised children?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jacqui Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is asking whether it is important that care homes have consideration of close relatives in regard to contact and the record of complaints, I can say that I believe
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0048">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
that it is. As he knows, the issue of same-sex relationships is receiving much attention in the broader context of Government policy and we are making considerable progress on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also raised the important issues of service users guides and the transparency of fees. It is important that the regulations provide that service users guides require that service users know the basis on which they are charged fees. The standards underpinning the regulations require a full statement of terms and conditions of a placement and spell out rights and obligations. It must cover the fees payable and, as I have made clear, a nursing home would need to make explicit how it passed on to its users the benefits of the significant investment that the Government have made into free nursing care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Harris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not be drawn on the issue of whether the disbursement is significant and what that means, but have the standards to which the Minister has referred been, or will they be, published?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jacqui Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The standards for older people have certainly been published—in March 2001. They spell out the service users guides and the need for some of the other provisions that I was talking about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On regulation 16(2) (m), I believe that democratic activities are covered by local, social and community activities and by the improvements that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
Government have made to the availability of postal votes. The hon. Member for Worthing, West made an important point about adult placement. The limit for adult placements is now three people. The Government consulted on the basis that the definition of adult placements should be reduced to two service users but we accepted the genuine concern that that would cause difficulties and amended the regulation to allow all adult placement carers to take up to three service users.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a welcome concession. Some people may wish that the figure had been higher, but to move from two to three people will be a significant change for several operators.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jacqui Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that hon. Members have also noted the range of ways in which the regulatory framework for adult placements is much lighter than for other care homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a good debate. We have considered in detail the way in which the standards and regulations will maintain and improve quality and ensure that we put users' needs at the centre of the regulatory process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
