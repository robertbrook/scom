	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Miss Melanie Johnson)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><q><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.</p></q>
Directors' pay is at the centre of the debate on effective corporate governance. Directors have an obvious conflict of interest on the issue, and there is clearly public concern about that. The Government have made it clear that they do not support high rewards for mediocre or poor performance. Too often, directors are seen to have been paid excessive amounts when a company has performed badly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Michael Fabricant 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lichfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is very generous in giving way so early. She uses the word "seem" in relation to not performing well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The word was "seen". not "seem". My diction may not have been perfect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Michael Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's diction is probably perfect; it is probably my auditory system that is imperfect. I should nevertheless like to ask a question. She relates a director's performance to how a company has performed in a particular year. However, as she knows, many companies, especially in high-tech industries, must take a much longer-term view than just one year. Is there not a danger that a director's performance may be judged on one year's activities, whereas his activities may bear fruit three or four years hence, especially in, for example, long-term marketing or research and development?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Shareholders will have an opportunity to decide whether the time frame that the hon. Gentleman suggests is appropriate for judging such matters. Given his early enthusiasm for the debate, I trust that he will be here throughout to hear the detail and points made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I was saying, too often directors are seen to have been paid excessive amounts when a company has performed badly. That is unacceptable to employees who are losing their jobs, and it damages the reputation of business in the wider community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Waterson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastbourne)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make a little progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will save time in the long run.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman, but I feel that I am being a little silly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not allow the Minister or anyone else to suggest that she is being silly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
Before the Minister goes on to set the tone of the debate, I should like to ask whether the speech was written before the recent dramatic fall in the stock market. As she will appreciate, many of the people to whom she refers have packages that depend on share options, for example, the value of which will have dropped dramatically, as has happened in the case of ordinary shareholders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In proposing the regulations, the Government are taking a view not on remuneration, but on transparency, openness and accountability to shareholders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We decided to take action to strengthen the corporate governance framework for several reasons. Shareholders need to be fully informed to make their own judgments and to play their proper role. The regulations will increase transparency through greater disclosure of remuneration policy and will strengthen the accountability of boards to their shareholders by shareholder vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government recognise that it is important for our major companies to be able to attract, retain and motivate high-calibre directors to sustain and improve the United Kingdom's productivity and competitiveness in the global economy. We have consistently made it clear that we are not in the business of becoming involved in setting directors' pay in individual companies. We want to create an open and effective framework in which pay will be set and disclosed, given the conflict of interest that directors face and the consequent public concern. More than six years ago, the Greenbury report set out three relevant fundamental principles: accountability, transparency and performance linkage. The Government think that those are the right principles, but we do not think that the best practice framework has achieved adequate compliance with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the regulations is to improve transparency, accountability and the linkage of pay to performance in the setting of directors' remuneration. That will be achieved by amending schedule 6 of the Companies Act 1985 to require companies to produce an annual directors' remuneration report, and by giving shareholders the right to vote on that report through the addition of new section 241 A. Some of that is not new, as we are merely transposing existing listing rules requirements into the 1985 Act. However, the improved disclosure of remuneration policy, the linkage to performance and the annual shareholders' vote are all new.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister say what will be the precise effect of the regulations if the shareholders vote against the directors' remuneration package report at a general meeting?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would indicate the shareholders' concern about how the process had been conducted and the nature of it, which would encourage the company to act in greater compliance with the shareholders' views in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Michael Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way on that point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0131">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me answer the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) first. The vote would be purely advisory, and it would therefore have no legal effect, but a strong opposing vote would send the board a powerful signal that it would be unlikely to be able to ignore.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Michael Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So, a detailed document has to be prepared. That will take time, particularly for a company that is not performing well because it is investing for the future, which takes resources. Apart from offering encouragement and powerful signals, the bottom line is that nothing would come of such a vote, even if there were an indictment by the shareholders, because the regulations are not mandatory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am certainly not saying that. The hon. Gentleman is getting it very wrong. Obviously, any decent company will have to produce a forward-looking remuneration policy in any event. It makes good sense to have such a policy. The requirement for a vote means that companies will consider remuneration matters carefully, as well as considering the directors' remuneration awards from the previous financial year, which is not a great deal of work in respect of producing a report. Companies will want to respond to the message sent out by the shareholder vote. A non-advisory vote could cause significant legal difficulties with respect to a director's contractual entitlements, as Opposition Members will appreciate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Gibb 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has cited Greenbury. I take it that she has also read the Cadbury report, which is the first in that series of reports on corporate governance. It contains a paragraph that says—I paraphrase—that the danger of implementing ever more rules and codes of conduct is that companies will feel that they have to abide by them. The more rules and codes we have, the greater the tendency to obey them but not go beyond that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister agree that we have reached a stage in our corporate governance, company law and regulatory regime at which directors just obey the rules and do not go beyond that by asking, "Is this issue right or wrong?"? People will end up doing things that are probably wrong simply because of the proliferation of rules, which make them take their eye off what is right and wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The rules being proposed do not, in many cases, exist elsewhere. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman is trying to unpick Cadbury or Greenbury or anything else, but we are endeavouring to ensure that there is greater compliance. If people simply stuck to the rules, they could use the framework that is in place. Suggestions have already been made for more transparent and open ways to deal with these matters. When compliance is not working, we try to inject that transparency with at least the spirit of much of what has been called good practice in corporate governance over the past few years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are having an interesting and important debate. The more that such rules are developed, the more companies will be involved with compliance. While they think that all they must do is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
comply with rules, the next stage is to look at loopholes in those rules. We have seen that with Enron and with WorldCom. We want business to take to a wider view and to ask, "Is this issue right?". not simply devote hours of the compliance office's time to complying with the rules. Given the proliferation of rules and codes of conduct, we have departed completely from the notion of what is right. All the Minister is doing with the regulations is adding to that problem. Does she understand my point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see the hon. Gentleman's point; I simply do not agree with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Conservative party was in government, it did not argue that we should abandon Greenbury, Cadbury or the other corporate governance reports. There is non-compliance with the best practice principles. We support such principles in other areas, and I regret that the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr. Gibb) is referring specifically to the accounting front in relation to post-Enron issues, because the United Kingdom takes a principles-based approach. As he appreciates, the United States of America has a rules-based approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not deviating from our support for the principles-based approach for accountancy. We have supported those principles, but they are not working in line with good practice among companies. The purpose of the vote is to encourage debate between the shareholders and the company, and that should take place at an early stage rather than at an annual general meeting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Alan Simpson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nottingham, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend has to field too many more questions from Opposition Members, will she make it clear that there are problems with the current position not because of difficulties over companies complying with regulations, but because some companies make up their own regulations and figures, and then wing it with a glut of self-reward? It is against the backcloth of the lack of confidence in corporate governance that we must revisit the sense of probity and have a clear framework in which we can expect people to work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his remarks, and he is entirely right. We want employees and shareholders who are worried about pay awards to company directors that are not matched by good performance to have access to more transparency and accountability than they currently gain through the practices of many companies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make a little progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations will apply to quoted companies. Those are companies that are incorporated in the United Kingdom and listed in the UK or in a European Economic Area state, or on the New York stock exchange or Nasdaq. I shall run through the regulations in more detail to help hon. Gentlemen. They require companies to publish for each financial year a directors' remuneration report, which will be divided into two main parts: a policy section and a report section examining directors' pay in the recent financial year in question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0132">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
The policy section must include a statement on the company's future policy on directors' remuneration, including details and an explanation of performance criteria, or the lack of them, for share options or long-term incentive schemes. It must also include an explanation of company policy on service agreements and their duration, notice periods and termination payments, with an explanation of any significant award to a director whose services were terminated in the previous year. Remuneration committee details must also be provided, such as the names of members, those who advised them and the nature of any other services provided to the company by those advisers. That part of the report must include a performance line graph that shows how the company has performed compared with an appropriate share market index.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The review section must include full details of each director's pay package, set out in tabular format and broken down to show the amount of each element that forms the package. That includes full details of any share options and long-term incentive schemes, and details of significant awards made to a director whose service agreement was terminated in the most recent financial year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations also require that a resolution to approve the directors' remuneration report be moved at the annual general meeting. That vote will be advisory. In other words, it will not require companies to amend contractual entitlements. Nevertheless, the Government believe that the result of a vote will send a very strong signal to directors and that directors will want to take notice of the shareholders' views and respond appropriately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The specific requirements that I have outlined were concluded on after a detailed consultation on draft regulations, which was published in December last year and closed on 15 March this year. We received a substantial response to that consultation, which included a wide range of differing opinions, as hon. Members will be unsurprised to hear. Balancing those opinions has proved difficult, but the Government believe that the changes that we have made to the draft regulations as a result of the consultation has led to better balanced legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal briefly with the three changes. First, companies are now required to produce only one performance graph showing their performance, in terms of total shareholder return, over the last five years against an appropriate equity market index. The regulations as drafted in the consultation document would have meant that some companies might have had to produce many pages of complex graphical data. We felt that that would not contribute to clarity of disclosure, and decided that the default total shareholder return graph, as described in the consultation document, is the best option. Of course, it is open to companies to supplement that with information on performance that uses what they consider to be more appropriate measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, companies will be required to disclose other services provided to the company by any firm that advises the remuneration committee, and whether
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
the committee was able to appoint its own consultants. The Government believe that the remuneration committee should be able to choose its own source of advice. We are aware that there is the potential for conflicts of interest if the consultancy appointed to advise the remuneration committee also provides advice to the executive directors on other matters. That is why we have decided on greater transparency in that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, companies will not be required to disclose whether the board accepted the remuneration committee's recommendations without amendment and details of recommendations that were not accepted by the board. Having considered the matter carefully, the Government have decided that requiring that disclosure might have undesirable consequences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Michael Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned the consequences of the board not agreeing with shareholder recommendations on publication of the report. Will she say precisely what the legal consequences will be, as they give the statutory instrument teeth?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already answered the hon. Gentleman's point. We believe that a strong message will be sent; directors will then have to decide how to respond in future years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Michael Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne just said, we may be talking at cross purposes. I take the Minister's point, but she said earlier that there would be legal consequences if a board of directors chose to ignore the strong wishes of the shareholders expressed as a consequence of the publication of the report. [	<i>Interruption</i>.]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. One speaker at a time. If Mr. Fabricant has finished, Miss Johnson may reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am struggling to find the reference. I am not sure what the hon. Member for Lichfield (Michael Fabricant) is referring to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My intervention is an attempt to move us on. My hon. Friend is referring to the Minister's point on taking the directors as a package, in relation to the legal consequences, and the problems of overturning that package. That could lead to lawsuits by people who thought that they already had a remuneration package. I do not want to forfeit my other intervention, which I am still waiting to make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is the point that the hon. Member for Lichfield is making, I understand and I am grateful for the clarification. However, there would be contractual difficulties with that, because the retrospective look at pay is just that. That pay would already have gone out, contractual obligations would have been entered into and there would be legal consequences if one tried to unpick that. Therefore, retrospective change is not a viable option and it has been rejected. I hope that that clarifies the hon. Gentleman's point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Michael Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for her clarification, but I must again ask what meaning this statutory instrument has if it turns out that we are reporting a historical change that has been made and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0133">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
which is contractually sound between the company and the directors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I explained too quickly. The policy has two parts. The report has a retrospective aspect, which looks back over the pay and remuneration packages of the previous year, and a future aspect, which considers the policy that the directors or the company would propose to adopt in relation to directors' remuneration. It looks ahead and says exactly what the criteria will be. That element will have a direct impact on what will but has not yet taken place, so it therefore does not fall foul of existing contractual liabilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Marsden 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Shrewsbury and Atcham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why has new Labour opted for a U-turn? Section 2.7, covering trade and industry, of the 1997 new Labour handbook states:
	<br><q><p>"There must be greater disclosure of executive pay packages in company accounts, and all companies should seek prior"—</p></q>
I stress "prior"—
	<br><q><p>"and explicit approval for pay decisions from shareholders."</p></q>
What has changed? Why the U-turn?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no U-turn, and the hon. Gentleman is striving to make a point that does not exist. We are placing on companies an obligation to declare their future remuneration policy. If the shareholders see fit to reject that by expressing opposition in a vote, it will be for companies to rethink that remuneration policy, or they will fall foul of the severe disapproval of their shareholders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is my free shot. So that we can all pack up and go home, will the Minister identify what precise difference the regulations will make to a currently listed company, which is required to obey the code that is part of the listing rules as a pre-condition to being listed at all? What is the precise difference between the current arrangements and the regulations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I explained some of the added extras. A company may comply with the code and use good or best practice under it—that is similar to what the regulations require. There is nothing to prevent people from complying with the code or doing more. The point is whether they generally do so. We know from the evidence that they do not, and there is insufficient compliance with good practice and the code. If a company were in contravention of the listing rules, it would clearly be at risk of being delisted. However, those are not the only issues to be considered in this context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return briefly to my final remark on not having to disclose the details of proposals that were not accepted by the board, we accept that if we required such disclosure it might well lead to substantive discussions taking place in private and not, therefore, to improved transparency. The changes are practical, and they provide for more disclosure where necessary and for the regulatory burden to be reduced where appropriate. Overall, the regulations reflect a balanced approach to creating an appropriate framework for the setting of directors' remuneration and I commend them to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
I return briefly to the listing rules. Under them, there is no requirement on future policy or on justification of compensation under contract, so they would not be sufficient.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.54 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am, as always, grateful to the Minister for her introduction. The penetrating insights afforded by the interventions of my hon. Friend the Member for Lichfield reveal a situation in which listed companies, under the code that is incorporated in the listing rules, are required to do almost all the good things that might be expected of significant public companies post-Greenbury. The regulations add extra bells and whistles to which I shall return in more detail, but even if there is a vote, it will not make any difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I clarify that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just one more sentence. All that we are being asked to do is use the full majesty of the law to give people the opportunity to have a row.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman clarify whether he and his party believe that the shareholders' view of what a company is doing is irrelevant and whether it should be completely disregarded by companies?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what the Americans call a no-brainer. These proceedings, which are unlikely to receive much media coverage, would receive rather more if I were to say, "Yes, it is our policy that shareholders should have absolutely no input to the running of a company."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall take the Committee through the history of the matter. A lot of the committees were set up under the Conservative Government and their findings were welcomed by them. We are not going to vote against the regulations—I do not think we will, unless there is a sudden exodus from the Room. All that I am trying to do is expose the threadbare reasoning behind the Government's thinking. We all saw the rather glorious press release put out by the Secretary of State when the regulations were published and the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Mr. Marsden) has told us what was promised. For all I know, that might be the very thing that caused him to cross the Floor. In reality, however, nothing much is happening other than what happens already, with the addition of a few bells and whistles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall spend an hour and a half or so debating regulations that simply create a chance for a row. People are not slow to take advantage of such opportunities without the benefit of regulations. I recall a meeting of one public company—British Gas, I think—at which a large pig was produced. That appeared in all the media, and there have been several other major rows at shareholder general meetings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Michael Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend share my concern that the regulations will not affect large corporations that employ teams of people to handle such documents so much as smaller ones? I do not have to remind the Committee of the size of the document—even the schedule runs to some 21
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0134">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
paragraphs and the Minister has already said that some of it is more than is required. However, smaller companies that are quoted on Nasdaq come under the ambit of the regulations, which, although we now find that they are merely window dressing, represent a major additional burden, particularly for high-tech companies. I ran that sort of company in the 1980s, and such burdens can contribute to their lack of performance. Some companies will have to employ extra people to produce the report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend speaks with considerable commercial experience, and the Committee would do well to listen to what he has to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to draw four main issues out of the regulations. The first is delay. Given how much of a mouse the regulations are in the real world, why has it taken the Government so long to produce them? Secondly, are the regulations the right option to pursue at the moment? At this time yesterday in a similar Room, or perhaps even the same Room, we discussed insolvency regulations and I pointed out that the Government seem to be acting piecemeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that there will be a major announcement on company law reform next week, and presumably the Government intend to announce a large Bill on the subject in the Queen's Speech. I suspect that much of that Bill will be non-controversial and that its intentions will find support among all parties. Why deal with the matter now, given the delay of three years or so in sorting it out, when we know that the whole question of corporate governance will be considered in a different context in the autumn? That will not be a moment too soon, however.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, will the regulations make any difference? Will they be more effective than current legislation? We have heard that the votes will not be legally binding. For the reasons that the Minister explained, which I entirely accept, we have to treat all directors' remuneration as one package in terms of the vote. If one so-called fat cat receives an extraordinary package, but everyone else receives something reasonable or even minimal, a vote against everybody's package will be the only option. However, it will make no legal difference, as the Minister conceded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To clarify, the vote may not be legally binding, but it will make a huge practical difference. The practicalities and the impact of the proposals are what we are interested in, not whether the vote is legally binding. The effect will be the same.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister concedes that people are not slow to criticise if there is unease over the remuneration of directors or chief executives. I have a sheaf of cuttings from the Library along those lines, and I shall refer to a small selection of them in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such matters are often aired through the media and at shareholder meetings. As I understand it, although I am open to correction by the Minister, even now shareholders can vote down the directors' report to a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
meeting. That would be inconvenient for a large company, but it is possible in theory, so what is she giving shareholders that they do not have at the moment? Is she giving them merely another opportunity to have a bit of a ruck or a row?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the question whether the regulations address the growth of legitimate shareholder activism. I welcome as a useful development in this country the fact that shareholders in many companies are rightly taking much greater interest in how their company is run. Perhaps they take more interest when the shares plummet and the directors' remuneration packages soar, but that is human nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A while ago, I read that all large Japanese companies hold their general meetings on the same day to get round the fact that the Japanese version of the Mafia—the yakuza, I think—could make a good living by threatening to disrupt shareholders' meetings by buying shares in large companies and sending some toughs along to cause trouble. Of course, that is not the kind of shareholder activism that I advocate, but it is important that shareholders be active. They should have full information on the remuneration packages, as is the case under the listing rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also important that shareholders have the opportunity—they have in recent memory—to raise issues at shareholders' meetings. I can remember any number of occasions when shareholders have complained at their meetings about the remuneration packages of directors and senior executives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall sketch in some background. The combined code has resulted from the Cadbury, Greenbury and Hampel reports on various aspects of corporate governance. The code recommends that the pay of executive directors should be subject to the recommendations of a committee of non-executive directors. That is not new; the 1995 Greenbury report was prompted by a surge of concern about executive pay, much of it to do with the privatisation of nationalised industries, and the phrase "fat cats" was being hurled about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Conservative Government welcomed the Greenbury report. As the excellent Library briefing on the regulations makes clear, many Greenbury requirements did not need legislation as they applied to listed companies. They were implemented in March 1997 by making changes to the listing rules following consultation—again, during the term, although close to the end of it, of the Conservative Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is certainly true that Labour in opposition made a great deal of fat cats. Indeed, it was an issue in Labour's campaign—I suppose that opposition parties are allowed to do that sort of thing—and it no doubt contributed to Labour's electoral success. However, the Government have been remarkably slow to do anything about it. We may hear from the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham on that issue later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend know how many so-called executive fat cats earn more than £90,000 a week? Why are people so hostile to company executives who produce goods and services, yet not hostile to footballers who earn considerably more?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0135">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman knows that he is straying somewhat widely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am no great expert on football, as my hon. Friends may know, but I agree that people should be paid the rate for the job. The rate for the top executives and directors of big public companies is rather like a transfer fee, and we are told that there is a international market for such people. We have seen the package being offered, for example, to anyone who can rescue Consignia. I do not know what would happen at Consignia shareholders' meetings if complaints were made about the directors' remuneration when the company is losing £1.5 million a day, because it has only one shareholder in the person of the Secretary of State. I suppose that some voting arrangement could be worked out, but I presume that she would have the only vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gibb</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point that I was trying to make, without going against your ruling, Mr. Hurst, is that the Government are not introducing regulations to deal with footballers similar to those that they propose to deal with business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not for me to fathom the Government's reasoning processes, but I suspect that the answer is that one of those measures would be unpopular.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Michael Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, it has to be said that some football clubs are registered as companies on the stock exchange and they could come within the ambit of the regulations. Although footballers are unlikely to be club directors, highly-paid managers often are, so I wonder whether football clubs will have to produce similar reports. The Minister seems to be nodding, so I assume that they will, if they are quoted on the stock exchange or Nasdaq.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend, because the term "company director" covers a multitude of different skills and experience. I vividly recall, as a young barrister, defending a gentleman on a charge of armed robbery. While helping him to fill out his legal aid forms in his cell, I asked him to write down his occupation. He wrote "company director". but he contrived to make a spelling mistake in both words. To this day, I have no idea what kind of company he was a director of, but he is very large, so I have no intention of arguing with him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On delays, executive pay may have been one issue that helped to sweep new Labour to power in 1997—things could only get better then, but how long ago that seems. However, only in July 1999, the Government built on existing codes by issuing a consultation document on further changes to executive pay. They commissioned PricewaterhouseCoopers—I do not know why it was not Arthur Andersen on that occasion—to examine compliance with existing requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Things went quiet for a bit, until 7 March 2001, when the then Secretary of State announced that there would be new disclosure requirements for directors, and a press release, of course, went out. Things again went a bit quiet, until October 2001, when the current Secretary of State announced the requirement that the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
remuneration report should be subject to a shareholder vote each year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Interestingly, that was not a new proposal, and the Cadbury committee—the mother and father of all recent corporate governance studies—had rejected it as "unworkable" in 1992. The Greenbury committee took a similar view, and in 1998 Hampel said:
	<br><q><p>"Greenbury recommended that the remuneration committee's report to shareholders should not be a standard item of agenda for AGMs; but that a view should be taken each year whether the AGM should be invited to approve the remuneration policy. We agree that the decision whether to seek shareholder approval for the remuneration report should be one for the company. To require shareholder approval for a single aspect of company policy would, in our view, be inappropriate. A shareholder sufficiently unhappy with the remuneration report ultimately has the opportunity to vote against the whole of the report and accounts."</p></q>
I have said already that such a facility exists, and shareholders have not been slow to use it. Indeed, they have done so increasingly in recent times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Library report states:
	<br><q><p>"The Government's proposals are for a vote that is not binding on directors."</p></q>
The Minister made the same point in different words, when she said that the vote will give shareholders an opportunity to show their concern. She went a little further, but that was her main thrust. We agree that that arrangement is fine, save that shareholders already have plenty of opportunities to show their concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also rightly commented on retrospectivity. The reason why the vote can make no legal difference is that the agreements are already set in concrete. On any opportunity to overturn those agreements, I shall paraphrase her, although I hope that I am not doing her an injustice—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Almost certainly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is welcome to correct me anytime, but I think that her point was that directors will have legal redress if the general meeting throws out individual packages. That is why the vote will have no legal meaning and why the package must be voted on for all the directors, not individuals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has it fixed in his mind that two different issues are being tackled. One is historical remuneration, which cannot be changed because the company has contractual obligations. The other is future remuneration policy, which will be covered in the report. That policy looks ahead and much about it can change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the Minister that I am well aware of that, and I hope to deal with the issue if time allows. I appreciate that perhaps the only genuinely novel aspect of the regulations is the idea of a future remuneration policy. It would be interesting to know how many of those listed companies already have a report of some sort dealing with their future policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Michael Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister made a timely intervention to point out, as she did earlier, that there are two aspects to the report, one retrospective and the other dealing with future policy, but does my hon. Friend agree that directors, especially those with particular skills, are likely to be put on long-term
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0136">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
contracts and that such contracts are likely to apply for many years hence, unless there are to be major changes to the phalanx of directors? Because of those contractual arrangements, neither the retrospective aspect of the report nor that dealing with future policy will apply to them. Secondly—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is not going to be a secondly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in my hon. Friend's remarks, although I am not sure that the contracts that we are talking about will be of such duration. Non-executive directors tend to rotate on a three-yearly cycle, but I again bow to those with greater direct experience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help both hon. Gentlemen. The combined code recommends a one-year contract and the majority of directors are on such contracts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That does not affect my hon. Friend's central point, which the Minister has agreed to, that the vote on the remuneration package or packages is entirely historic and cannot change anything. The vote on the future remuneration policy could have an affect on future developments but is equally not binding in any legal sense on the directors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not clear; perhaps the hon. Gentleman can help me. How does he think anything can change past remuneration policies? I would like to be clear, because the hon. Gentleman is implying that we are not doing something that we should be doing about past remuneration. What exactly does he suggest the Government might do on that score?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They might stop spinning the measure—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not an answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will be when I get to the end of it, if the Minister will allow me. The Government have been spinning this since long before they actually did something about it. The idea has obviously been at the back of some dusty cupboard at the DTI, and suddenly, in a great rush because of the approaching summer recess, after three years it has been dusted off—along with a lot of other things, which I do not want to go into.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the reality is that this will not give an iota of additional power to shareholders. It will not do anything more to encourage or assist shareholder activism than the current arrangements. As long as we can agree that, we can make some progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We really cannot agree that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then let us move on to see whether we can find something that we can agree on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the risk of provoking the Minister, we all accept, because it is self-evident, that one cannot reopen the packages that have already been agreed and to which the directors have a legal entitlement. Under the regulations, the shareholders can have a moan about those and they can press that moan to a vote, rather as we often do in this Committee. However, it will not
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
make a jot of difference, rather as happens in this sort of Committee when the governing party has a large parliamentary majority. There is nothing to disagree about, except the Government's presentation of the measures, which is perhaps beyond the scope of the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A couple of sentences from the Library briefing are particularly penetrating and follow on from what I said earlier. It states:
	<br><q><p>"One issue which may be raised when the Regulations are debated"—</p></q>
indeed, I have raised it—
	<br><q><p>"is the slow pace with which the legislation has been brought forward."</p></q>
It goes on to state:
	<br><q><p>"much of what they"—</p></q>
the proposals—
	<br><q><p>"require is already required by the Listing Rules."</p></q>
Again, that is self-evident.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us move on to the comments of outside organisations on the proposals. It will come as no surprise to the Committee that John Monks of the Trades Union Congress has welcomed the proposals. He says:
	<br><q><p>"Forcing companies to hold separate votes on remuneration packages at AGMs is a very welcome move. Executives will now need to justify their pay rises … Companies that include employees on their remuneration committees, as the TUC suggests, are likely to get an easier ride at AGMs".</p></q>
It is clear, therefore, that the unions have their own agenda, but that is not covered in the regulations. What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. One wonders whether there should be similar regulations about the packages of remuneration for trade union leaders. Do the Government have any plans on that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall move rapidly on. The National Association of Pension Funds, which represents many British companies that have substantial shareholders through their pension funds, has said:
	<br><q><p>"Well structured and forward looking remuneration committee reports should provide shareholders with a sound basis to form a judgement on whether a company's board has adopted a policy that will assist them in promoting long term growth".</p></q>
The association broadly welcomes the thrust of the regulations.
The Institute of Directors says that it
	<br><q><p>"broadly welcomes the Government's proposed regulations for greater transparency on directors' pay".</p></q>
However, its director general, Mr. George Cox, went on to say:
	<br><q><p>"Although the proposals relate to the annual reporting of remuneration policies and packages, it is important that the process starts well before the AGM and is part of a continuous dialogue with shareholders".</p></q>
That ties in rather neatly with an intervention made by my hon. Friend the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton. He pointed out that when we are prescriptive about such matters, there is a danger—I do not want to overstate it; in theory, one could say it about any regulations—that people get into box-ticking mode. What we need is a company that will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0137">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
engage with its shareholders and their concerns on a year-round basis. That is what the Institute of Directors said, and I agree. There must not be some great climactic row once a year at the general meeting, a row that leads nowhere, for the reasons I touched on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More so than many such documents, the explanatory memorandum is helpful on some points, and I want to touch on a couple of them. In the rather neutral language that we expect from an explanatory memorandum, it supports our view that the regulations are largely symbolic. We are not giving anyone new legal powers or obligations. The memorandum states that
	<br><q><p>"the regulations have the effect of translating the Listing Rules disclosures into legislation."</p></q>
That is the explanation in a nutshell. I could almost rely entirely on the memorandum to make my point. As it is a requirement of listing that one fulfils the listing rules, we are simply turning what already exists into legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The explanatory memorandum is more contentious in mentioning conflicts of interest when executive directors decide their own remuneration. Companies now tend to have remuneration committees of non-executive directors to decide such matters. Does the Minister have statistics on those at her fingertips? I suspect that the vast majority of listed companies have such procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The memorandum states:
	<br><q><p>"In the Government's view, the requirements in the Listing Rules mean that there is an acceptable level of transparency in respect of the disclosure of individual directors' packages."</p></q>
Before the Minister leaps to her feet, I shall pause without going on to make the point that the memorandum makes on the Government's behalf. The issue is not about transparency. The current rules, as they apply to listed companies, require transparency as to packages, and the regulations will make no difference to that. We already know that the regulations will make no difference to the ability to reopen those packages, and we all agree with the reasons for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same paragraph of the memorandum makes the point that the Government do not hold the view
	<br><q><p>"that there has been adequate compliance with the Greenbury recommendations on the disclosure of … policy: this includes the rationale for, and the main parameters of, share option or other long-term incentive schemes".</p></q>
Our welcome for the regulations is generally friendly but slightly lukewarm, because they will make so little difference in practice. However, the Minister has a point in that a debate on the future policy is an important innovation in itself, if not the headline that the Government would seek.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Michael Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To reinforce my hon. Friend's point, I should point out that the regulatory impact assessment published by the Minister's Department says that for
	<br><q><p>"the large majority of the 15,000 public companies on the register there would be no change to reporting requirements if the regulations were to be introduced."</p></q>
The measure is just empty window-dressing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a point that I was going to make later, in my comments on the regulatory impact assessment. He is absolutely right. The Government cannot have it both ways—they cannot publish a regulatory impact assessment that concludes in a nutshell that the extra cost for businesses will be minimal and then claim that the measure is a great innovation that will be of massive benefit to shareholders. The two claims do not sit together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the remuneration policy, the packages that we are discussing tend not to be cash only but to include share options or other long-term incentive schemes. On my first intervention, I tried to make the point that the first part of the Minister's speech seemed to have been written before the recent collapse in stock market prices to a level below that of 1997. Many blameless and even praiseworthy senior executives and directors in large listed companies must be seeing their package disappear or become significantly less valuable, through no fault of their own. [	<i>Interruption</i>.] Sorry, I did not catch that sedentary intervention from the silent one on the Government Front Bench.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Michael Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hurst. I have to leave the Committee because I have to attend another meeting, as the Minister knows.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, that is not a point of order, and his travel arrangements are not a matter for the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish my hon. Friend well in his journey down the Committee Corridor and hope that he does not get lost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the author of the explanatory memorandum, which is crystal clear. It states:
	<br><q><p>"The regulations are structured so that the vote will be advisory. The regulations will not require directors to amend entitlements under their service agreements, nor to amend their remuneration policy … The shareholder vote will … send an appropriate message to the directors."</p></q>
That is a useful point on which to leave the explanatory memorandum. It is right to regard the measure as a way to send a message.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other ways in which shareholders may send such messages. I have glanced cursorily through the many press cuttings about the issue of directors' pay. Such news seems to come in cycles, and there was a phase of it after some of the nationalised industries were privatised. There is clearly an issue over packages that are historic and not open to a vote that means anything, and share prices that collapse for other reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Association of Pension Funds has criticised the Government, saying that
	<br><q><p>"had the government acted sooner, it might have been easier for shareholders to deter controversial pay deals."</p></q>
After the £2.4 million package for Sir Christopher Gent of Vodafone, when the company had reported Britain's biggest ever corporate loss, the NAPF spokesman said:
	<br><q><p>"We've been calling for a vote for some time. The sooner it happens the better. It has already taken three years."</p></q>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0138">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
The example of Vodafone is interesting because Sir Christopher received that package at about the time the company made a reported loss of £13.5 billion—biggest in UK corporate history. As we know, however, that the shareholder vote does not affect matters at a general meeting, it is interesting to see how the problem can be self-regulating. An article in the 	<i>Financial Times</i> a couple of weeks ago said:
	<br><q><p>"Vodafone hopes to quell public criticism … by tying 80 per cent, of his pay to the company's performance and setting aggressive performance targets."</p></q>
There is some argument about the detail, but the article says that, before Sir Christopher can receive his deferred bonus,
	<br><q><p>"which could be worth more than £1.8 million … Vodafone must meet short-term growth targets based on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation … free cash flow and average revenues per user."</p></q>
Of course, the exact targets are not in the public domain, but my point is that his performance share can be collected only if the company's total shareholder return is better than 80 per cent, of its peers. Growth in earnings per share must be 15 per cent, above retail price inflation per annum. The options for Sir Christopher are worthless unless the share price rises above the strike price.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an important example because Vodafone is a responsible company, which has made a large loss at a time when very large losses are being discovered in murky circumstances on the other side of the Atlantic, although there is no suggestion of anything similar in the case of Vodafone. Sir Christopher's package was obviously based, at least in part, on his historic achievements for the company, including its major acquisitions in recent years, and the company is determined that he should be nailed down to a detailed package that depends on his performance and that of the company, or its shareholders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other day, 	<i>The Guardian</i> reported a survey on directors' pay, published by New Bridge Street consultants, which found overwhelmingly that
	<br><q><p>"investors would have preferred companies to follow a voluntary code, rather than be bound by the proposed legislation. The survey found that two thirds of institutional investors did not welcome the government's proposals, which were put out for consultation last month."</p></q>
The Association of British Insurers has also said that the proposals will not work. It represents companies with one fifth of investments in the London stock market. It said:
	<br><q><p>"An advisory vote does not provide institutions with a strong enough say in the minority of cases where there is a serious excess … the proposed performance graph regulations are excessively complex and may distort performance targets. The objective of enhanced disclosure and accountability would be better achieved through revising corporate governance best practice rather than via legislation."</p></q>
Finally, I want to touch on some points made in the regulatory impact assessment—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind hon. Members that it is my intention to call the Minister no later than 5.50 pm. I hope that hon. Members will bear that in mind in making their remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely, Mr. Hurst. I do not intend to be on my feet at 5.50 pm unless I am sorely provoked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a nutshell, the regulatory impact assessment on the regulations mentions three different options for dealing with the perceived problem. The first is to continue to rely on compliance with accepted best practice. The second option is to introduce the regulations with which we are concerned today. The third option is to strengthen shareholder controls through legislation as a result of the company law review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already discussed option 1.1 have also talked about option 3, but it bears some repetition because we know that, in the autumn, the Government will put forward some major proposals for company law reform, on which they are to make an announcement next week. I hope that, in her concluding speech, the Minister will lift the veil on what proposals she has in mind in relation to directors' remuneration. It would be barmy for us to pass the regulations and then find ourselves—assuming we perform similar functions in the autumn—debating exactly the same issues in the context of a major Bill. The regulatory impact assessment—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman appreciate that other Committee members might not see this as a gay debate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not mean to get involved with political correctness. I meant gay in the old-fashioned sense. The issues are serious; they may cause some hilarity on the Government Benches, but we are considering imposing further requirements on British business and giving shareholders the false hope that they will have new muscle, which they will not have as a result of the regulations.
On option 2, the regulatory impact assessment report concludes:
	<br><q><p>"Legislation will achieve what reliance on voluntary compliance has not: increased transparency".</p></q>
In that, it is at odds with the explanatory memorandum, so I assume that they were drafted by two different officials. It continues, saying that
	<br><q><p>"strengthened accountability and more effective linkage between pay and performance and the competitiveness benefits this brings."</p></q>
We have already been through all the reasons why that will not happen in the real world, unless it is happening already. The comment on option 3 contains the reasonable point that
	<br><q><p>"Legislation … will … take time to draft, consult on and introduce."</p></q>
There was a delay of some three years in introducing the regulations, but we are now close to the introduction of company law reform. Why do we not wait and do it all at the same time? That is not the methodology that the Government tend to adopt. The regulatory impact assessment report concludes, as my hon. Friend the Member for Lichfield pointed out:
	<br><q><p>"The cost and impact of presenting this readily available information as required is believed to be minimal."</p></q>
It mentions some 2,700 companies that would be affected, because they are listed in the definition set
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0139">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
out in the regulations. The clincher, the issue on which I should draw my remarks to a close, is the conclusion that compliance costs
	<br><q><p>"would not add significantly to the costs of companies".</p></q>
Why? Because
	<br><q><p>"it is already a requirement of the Listing Rules that companies must disclose details of each director's pay."</p></q>
As I would say if I were in a court of law, I rest my case. There are legitimate concerns, but—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I advise the hon. Gentleman that he is not paid by the minute?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or even by result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many legitimate concerns about directors' pay. We are perfectly happy and enthusiastic that full details of directors' pay packages should be available to shareholders, as they are already for such companies, and that shareholders should have every opportunity to comment on them, particularly if they are unhappy with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a recent case, Mr. Jonathan Bloomer, the chief executive of the Prudential, was to have a package of some £18 million. However, the company was, as the 	<i>Daily Mail</i> reported,
	<br><q><p>"Forced into an embarrassing climbdown"</p></q>
over the scheme. That had nothing to do with the regulations. It was to do with public pressure, media attention and the muscle of institutional investors. Barclays bank had a similar experience. Small shareholders protested at the annual meeting over the award to Mr. Matt Barrett of a £15 million three-year package. Those shareholders had no need of these regulations to make their point. Even if the regulations had been in force and they had had a vote, it would have made no difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.39 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Vincent Cable 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Twickenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Eastbourne made some fair points, albeit at extraordinary length even by the standards that we are getting used to in Standing Committees. I shall try not to take up much of the Committee's time. I welcome measures that seek to strengthen shareholder influence over senior executive pay. There clearly are abuses, and corporate governance needs strengthening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with much of the critique suggesting that the measures are relatively weak, and I wish to make two criticisms. The first has been rehearsed at some length, which is that many of the measures, but not all, are included in the listing rules. Of course, some companies are not listed, so it takes us further in that respect, and as the Minister explained, additional measures including voting at the annual general meeting are steps forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second criticism—I shall concentrate my remarks on this—is that a lot of thought is being given to how to improve corporate governance in the round, and to ways of getting shareholders more proactively involved in setting the principles of pay and in setting the pay of major executives. That may come in later legislation, but not enough attention is given to it in the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
I return to the principles. I share the views expressed by the Government and the Opposition; we are not arguing about the principle that people should be paid substantial sums for important jobs. Most of us accept that sportsmen and entertainers should be given a large remuneration, and that people who head up big companies, who take big risks and are responsible for the livelihoods of tens of thousands of people should be paid well by international standards. I have no quarrel with that. However, abuses arise, and some have already been listed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most usual abuses occur when executives secure or arrange a package unrelated to performance, although some also get stock options—we know of cases at Barclays, Vodafone and others—but there are wider abuses. One of the most sickening pieces of financial news over the past few days was the titbit in the 	<i>Financial Times</i> at the weekend about the executive remuneration package for Jarvis, the rail maintenance company. Against the backcloth of Potters Bar, the associated uncertainties and the related cynicism of the company, its chief executive has been given a 60 per cent, pay increase. That kind of abuse leads to people demanding action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are the options? We are all agreed that it is not useful to try to deal with executive pay directly through regulation. We saw an element of that in the late 1970s, but it did not work and it has left a legacy of distortions. I did not realise until recently, from our lengthy debates on bloc exemptions and the car industry, that that peculiar problem originated from an attempt to control executive pay in 1978. The industry found a way of escaping the regulations by allowing executives to buy cars at discount prices, hence the chain of events that is still with us almost 25 years later. Direct regulation is not the way to deal with the problem. It will be better done through improvements to corporate governance, which the regulations are designed to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some respects, we need to go rather further than the regulations. The first question is how to get shareholders more directly involved in setting executive pay. They need to be involved in a proactive way, not just vote at the end of the year on whether they approve existing pay awards or even of the company's pay policy, and there are ways of achieving that. I set out in an article this morning an idea that is gathering some support in the business community. I propose representative shareholders. I know that that is a difficult concept. What is representative? How does one assemble such a group? Who should vote for them? A representative shareholders group—a council—could be directly involved in setting policy and in approving and negotiating executive pay, not only at annual general meetings. It would not then be left to remuneration committees. That could be made to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to take a comprehensive look at non-executive rules. At the moment, remuneration committees, which will retain their basic authority under the regulations, are made up predominantly of non-executive directors, but we all know that that system often works extremely badly. There is a relatively small pool of non-executive directors, some
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0140">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
of whom are recruited through headhunters, while others often come through the chief executive and may be old school friends. As it is a small pool, many non-executive directors are on far too many boards and do not focus on their responsibilities. They are not trained—frankly, many are incompetent—and they are easy meat in the hands of manipulative chief executives. We need a comprehensive reform of the system to ensure that non-executive directors who play an active role in companies, particularly on remuneration committees, are competent, focused and trained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We may hear more about this, but I hope that company reforms will not simply be a matter of holding an annual meeting and passing a non-mandatory vote. I hope that they will acknowledge the fact that we need to think much more deeply about how remuneration is set, because the current arrangements are fundamentally unsatisfactory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Before Millbank gets too excited, however, I should add that I am a director of the citizens advice bureau in Shrewsbury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must echo some of the comments of the hon. Member for Eastbourne. Why on earth have there been such long delays in dealing with this issue? The Minister alluded to consultations that have been taking place since December, but there has been a consultation paper since July 1999—for three long years. As I said earlier, Labour was quite clear in 1997 that shareholders should give "prior and explicit approval" before pay packages are agreed. That seems to have gone out the window, and I would like to know why. If that is what has happened, let the Minister by all means seek to justify it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the point about not requiring an amendment to directors' pay packages and entitlements, but why can we not refer the issue back? Why can we not consider meaningful regulations, instead of the ineffectual ones before us? Meaningful regulations would mean that companies had to reflect more forcefully on matters if shareholders disagreed. Likewise, why can we not consider remuneration per director, rather than taking or leaving the whole package?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will the success or otherwise of the regulations be judged? What is it in the regulations that will have made a difference in a year's time? What is it that will stop the headlines, mean that we no longer have great fat cat packages and allow companies to hold their directors to account through their shareholders? Those things simply will not happen because the regulations are weak and ineffectual and they will not stop the abuses. The good companies, which do the right thing, have nothing to fear, but I am afraid that the bad companies that the Government are targeting will carry on regardless. The regulations will not help in the process of justifying remuneration packages; they will simply allow abuses to continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.48 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to hon. Members for their contributions. I am particularly grateful to the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) for his speedy and thoughtful comments, which covered many interesting points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall run through some of the points that I have not already tried to answer in the debate, although I shall not run over ground that I have covered in interventions. First, I should make it clear that the listing rules are insufficient. Their scope is limited, and only UK-listed companies are covered. As I explained, the regulations cover a much wider range of quoted companies. The requirements are also limited, and there is only the single, nuclear option of delisting in response to a failure. Compliance with those requirements is not sufficient. The regulations are therefore not simply about bells and whistles, as the hon. Member for Eastbourne tried to suggest. They will provide a clearer linkage between pay and performance, and I think that we all accept that that is important. They will give shareholders better information and the right to have a say, which they currently do not have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, what is new about the disclosure element of the regulations is the improved disclosure of remuneration policy, which is forward-looking and through which the shareholders' views can have a clear influence. The linkage to performance, the annual vote by shareholders and the comparisons that can be made across the piece with other relevant companies will allow clear measures to be presented. The regulations also provide for the explanation and justification of compensation payments, a performance graph and a vote on the whole report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those measures all go much further than what we have gone at the moment. The hon. Member for Eastbourne seemed to suggest on the one hand that the measures were cumbersomely regulatory, on the other that they did absolutely nothing and on the third hand that some very important points were covered by their remuneration report aspect. I am a little confused by Conservative policy on this matter, as one would be by the party's policy on many other areas at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The directors' report cannot be voted down at the annual general meeting—the accounts are laid and there is no compulsory vote. The hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) talked about shareholder engagement, and we hope that there will be more engagement with shareholders. The vote is aimed at encouraging companies to sit down in advance of the annual general meeting to discuss pay and I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman that it is important that there is much more general engagement. However, those who are trying to persuade their shareholders that they are doing the right thing and are involving them in discussions will want to engage more as a result of this process, and that is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to the role of non-executives, the Government have commissioned a review by Derek Higgs. The consultation document was published on 7 June and the matter is still out for consultation. Through that review, Derek Higgs is considering many
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0141">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
of the points that the hon. Gentleman rightly raised about the quality of non-executive directors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the timing of the regulations, we decided to think carefully about the combined code that was introduced in June 1998. The indication is that it has not made the difference that we wanted it to make, hence the introduction of the regulations at this time. The listing rules give no requirement to comply with the combined code, only an obligation to disclose whether the code has been complied with, or, if it has not, to explain why. Compliance in this critical area has been disappointing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To clarify matters for the hon. Member for Eastbourne, he has misread the regulatory impact assessment. The RIA says there will be no change to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
the arrangements for private and unlisted public companies. Only listed companies are affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations will bring a greater transparency to the setting of directors' remuneration. They will make companies more accountable to shareholders in this area and provide for the demonstration of the linkage of pay with performance and I commend them to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
