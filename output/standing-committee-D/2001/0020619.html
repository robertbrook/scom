	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cotswold)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Local Government (Best Value) Performance Indicators and Performance Standards Order 2002. (S.I. 2002, No. 523)</p></blockquote>
May I have your permission to take off my coat, Mr. Atkinson, as it is rather a hot afternoon?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We prayed against the order, although I have no argument with the Minister because he has been in his post only a week or so. Frankly, if somebody had presented me with this document containing 24 pages of gobbledegook, I would have sent it back and given the person who drafted it a thick ear. Nine pages are spent virtually repeating the same set of authorities responsible for the different performance indicators. The same set could be listed once and the exclusions or inclusions listed underneath. That would have saved about four pages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With that caveat, Her Majesty's Opposition do not oppose continually upgrading and uprating standards of performance in government, whether local or central. Indeed, in 1994, we introduced the compulsory competitive tendering regime. We gradually extended that across a range of local government services, including service provision, so I have no quarrel with the principle. Best value is inherently a Conservative principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Neither do I have a problem with the principle of the order, which reduces the number of performance indicators from 125 to 97, which we welcome. However, those 97 include some very bureaucratic and centralising performance indicators, an example of which is on page 13. Schedule 3 deals with education performance indicators and we have no problems in general with performance indicators. Indicator No. 1 is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Youth Service expenditure per head of population in the Youth Service target age range."</p></blockquote>
It is clear, simple and straightforward, and something that every single local authority should easily be able to measure. Indicator No. 2 is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The percentage of primary schools with 25 per cent. or more of their places unfilled."</p></blockquote>
That is also simple and straightforward. Every local authority should easily be able to come up with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we go down the list, the indicators gradually get more bureaucratic and demanding. Indicator No. 10 is:
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"The percentage of pupils in schools maintained by the local education authority achieving Level 4 … in the Key Stage English test."</p></blockquote>
That is reasonable, but they suddenly start to get more exacting. Although there is nothing wrong with that, when the indicators become so exacting, exclusive and inclusive of different aspects, it becomes so bureaucratic and time-consuming for people to work out what is required that it gets ridiculous. Indicator 11 is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The percentage of statements of special educational need issued by the … authority in a financial year and prepared within 18 weeks—
	<ol>
	<li>excluding exception cases; and</li>
	<li>including those affected by "exceptions to the rule" under Special Educational Needs code of practice(a)."—</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
for goodness' sake. By the time someone has worked all of that out and filled in all of the forms, are we getting the benefit that the performance indicator is supposed to achieve?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order is yet another example of a centralising Government taking power away from local people and putting it in the hands of distant London-based politicians and bureaucrats—[	<i>Interruption</i>.] It is true. The hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen) moans and groans like a cow with a sick stomach. If he kept quiet and listened for a little longer, he might understand what is trying to be achieved through the statutory instrument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The red tape and bureaucracy of the regulations and performance indicators mean that good councils face additional costs and needless distractions. However, they do little to root out corruption and poor management in bad councils. Best value is yet another example of ineffective and expensive Whitehall red tape for local communities. The official Opposition have no problem with ratcheting up standards or with the Government setting standards to allow local government to do that. The question is how that is done and the benefit of what is laid out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quote Edwina Hart, who is the Labour Minister for Finance, Local Government and Communities in the National Assembly for Wales, which decided to abolish the best value regime. She said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Best Value inspection hasn't really worked … Local authorities have been fed up with the bureaucracy and the fact that they have reports telling them that they cannot improve when the whole purpose of Best Value is to improve."</p></blockquote>
The Labour leader of the Welsh Local Government Association, Sir Henry Jones has stated that councils were spending more time on process than actual service delivery. Matthew Warburton, who is head of futures at the Local Government Association, has said that best value
	<br><blockquote><p>"has led to a mountain of rules and guidance, which in turn has created an enormous paperchase as authorities try to justify their decisions to the inspectors".</p></blockquote>
Best value—[	<i>Interruption</i>] I do not know why the hon. Member for Nottingham, North keeps interrupting. If he adopted a little more patience and courtesy, he might actually learn something. Yes, I am talking to the hon. Gentleman who turns his head away. You are achieving nothing by being discourteous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0177">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind the hon. Gentleman to talk through the Chair?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly. I am sorry. No doubt you, Mr. Atkinson, noticed how discourteous the hon. Member for Nottingham, North was being.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Allen 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nottingham, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way. I hope that the hon. Gentleman has noticed that I am being courteous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Allen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman does not try to teach you how to do your job, Mr. Atkinson. I am sure that we are all very confident of your abilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No doubt the hon. Member for Nottingham, North will want to be as courteous as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Best value is proving enormously expensive and costly to local authorities. The Government have allocated £52 million this year for the best value administration. The Local Government Association has made the staggering estimate that it will cost an extra £175 million a year on top of that. I am glad that the Minister is listening carefully because a great deal could be achieved with £175 million. That is a huge sum and we want to ensure that we are getting best value from that money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall cite examples of what other councils think about the best value regime. One of Suffolk's district councils, with which you are familiar, Mr. Atkinson, was forced to add £100,000 to its 2000–01 budget in addition to recruiting a best value planning officer. Wokingham district council added £85,000 to its 2000–01 budget. Chichester district council has added £80,000 to its budget and I could cite many other councils that have had to increase their budgets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bill Roots, the chief executive of Westminster city council states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is overkill. The staffing costs of running best value will be"—</p></blockquote>
[	<i>Interruption</i>.] Labour Members should want to provide the best service rather than making yah-boo noises all the time. That is what we are all about. We are providing a service for people and if that is not what we want to do as politicians, we should not be here. We should listen to somebody who knows how to run a local council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Diana Organ 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Forest of Dean)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to my neighbour in a second, although I note that she was one of the people who made a noise. Perhaps I should start the quote again because I was interrupted. The hon. Member for Forest of Dean (Diana Organ) will have to wait a little longer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bill Roots says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is overkill. The staffing costs of running best value will be disproportionate. All this money could have been used for service provision".</p></blockquote>
I hope that the hon. Lady cares about the service provision of local authorities and economies in tax levels. The Government have introduced one of the greatest stealth taxes—an increase in council tax of
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
many times the rate of inflation in the past three or four years. One reason why council tax has had to increase so much is to pay for the costs of the best value regime to which I referred. "Will we get all this back in value-for-money savings?" asks Bill Roots, "I don't think so."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Diana Organ</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman refers to Westminster city council and best value. Does he believe that it delivered best value when it sold council houses under the right-to-buy policy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Each local authority had the option of large-scale voluntary transfers. It was entirely up to each council whether to participate in the scheme. The right to buy was a supremely successful policy introduced by the Conservative Government and continued by this Labour Government, who obviously also believe that it is a supremely successful policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Mole Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The earlier intervention was slightly misdirected, because right to buy was not the issue. On Westminster and quality, schedule 7, on page 17, refers to indicator No. 6. One of the most expensive local authorities in terms of waste collection is Westminster, because much of the waste in Westminster is collected daily, not weekly, or, as in Liberal Democrat-controlled Sutton, every second week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree. [	<i>Interruption</i>.] My hon. Friend says, "Thank God for that", sotto voce—I put that on record for him. If one walks around Westminster, as I do, one finds on the whole that the streets are clean and well maintained. If one walks, as I did for a recent debate on walking in our cities, over the bridge no more than 1,000 yd, one sees some examples of revolting rubbish that has been there not days or weeks but months, if not years. No doubt by many performance indicators Westminster is a flagship performing council in London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister might consider whether the best value regime might allow more flexibility in the scheme. We should not use a sledgehammer to crack a nut. We should allow efficient councils to get on with the job of running their own affairs while putting measures in place, perhaps through the best value regime, to tackle the inefficiencies of inefficient councils. If we were to do that and bring the worst councils nearer the performance of the best, we would achieve something.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why should councils that are already highly efficient be forced to pay the extra costs that I cited of the auditing, inspection, red tape and bureaucracy of the best value and performance indicators regime? Is there any need for one-size-fits-all performance indicators when efficient councils already meet best value targets for efficiency and performance indicators? Performance indicators do little to raise sufficiently the standards of poorly performing or corrupt councils. As Councillor Jane Chevis of Chichester district council said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We already make sure we are a model of efficiency and quality. We don't think the £180,000 plus it is costing us to follow Best Value legislation will be recouped by the savings it will produce for us. We believe in the principle of Best Value, but not the bureaucracy."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0178">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
I urge the Minister to introduce some flexibility into the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Best value, which replaced compulsory competitive tendering, has meant that there is no general requirement for councils to put their services out to tender. There has been a 66 per cent. drop in the number of contracts put out to tender since Labour came to power, according to the publication 	<i>Local Government Tenders</i>.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Audit Commission found that 23 per cent. fewer contracts were being advertised since the end of CCT. Indeed, Gateshead metropolitan borough council took a schools catering target back in house without testing the market or even talking to the private company that had run the contract for the previous six years. It did so only a month after a quality audit had shown that more than 90 per cent. of head teachers in Gateshead metropolitan borough council were very satisfied with the standard of the external contractors' service, and despite a guaranteed offer by the external contractor to save £1 million on the contract. If that is not political correctness gone mad, I do not know what is. If we are to be constructive in a Committee such as this, those are the sorts of things that we should look into. They are also the sorts of things that this type of statutory instrument should address, instead of trying to be a sledgehammer to crack a nut.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The best value regime aims for efficiency savings of only 2 per cent. In 1993, the Inlogov report found compulsory competitive tendering had brought savings of 7 per cent. Therefore, I return to my earlier point: this best value regime is hugely costly, but it is saving very little in cost and time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State has intervention powers and I want the Minister to tell me when they were last used. They include the transfer to a third party of the running of the service of a poorly performing council. That authority can also be required to take whatever actions are necessary to achieve best value. An authority can be directed to amend its best value plan and to conduct a best value review. The inspection service can be instructed to carry out an inspection. Those are the available sanctions. I wish to know when, and on how many occasions, they have been used, because unless they are used, there is no point in having a regime, as many councils throughout the country will not readily strive to meet the best value performance indicator targets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative councillors have always been natural supporters of best value regimes. It was Conservatives who first opened up local government to competition and thereby delivered greater efficiency. Through John Major's citizens charter, it was the Conservatives who first measured local government services, to ensure that the highest standards were met. Lord Hanningfield, the Labour vice-chairman of the Local Government Association, said of the best value regime:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It will do nothing to help the best councils which long ago decided voluntarily to make themselves more efficient and to enable the best-placed providers to carry out the services their council
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
taxpayers required. For these models of efficiency and accountability, Best Value will only divert valuable resources.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>On the other hand, Best Value will fall well short of what is needed to bring the worst councils up to scratch."</p></blockquote>
I remind hon. Members that the speaker is the Labour vice-chairman of the LGA. He continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"When the process reaches the external audit stage, this New Labour flagship will reach stormy waters indeed."</p></blockquote>
That is why we Conservatives say, "Little value, best forgotten."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The debate is important and, as I intend to ask many questions, I apologise to hon. Members if I take some time. However, I am keen that my contribution should not be unduly long and I am conscious that in the past 18 months there have been several debates on various aspects of best value, which have been properly used by hon. Members of all parties to say what they think about the principles of that matter. Therefore, to save a little of the Committee's time, I refer hon. Members to the contributions that I made on best value on 17 January 2001 and on 17 April 2002, as they clearly set out my views on the subject, and those of my party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having been on the same Committee as the hon. Gentleman, I just had to take the opportunity to thank him for enlightening us on the matter, particularly if it shortens his speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman intervenes in the same way that he always does on my speeches. He always adds to their length with his erudite contributions, to which I feel it necessary to respond. On this occasion, I am delighted that he is delighted. Let us therefore move on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to refer to the review made a few months ago by the Association for Public Service Excellence, which I have already mentioned, and its conclusions about best value. It acknowledges that many of the respondents had found best value helpful in principle. However, I shall repeat the conclusion, as it bears on what was said by the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown). It said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Many commented that the existing system was too bureaucratic, resource intensive and time consuming and there was hope that the review of Best Value would address some of these issues."</p></blockquote>
We are debating some of the outcomes of that review. We must consider whether it was carried out sensibly and whether it will make a big difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to place on record that the Government were confident that as they moved forward in their review of best value they would reduce bureaucracy. That was clearly stated in paragraph 3.64 of their White Paper on local government. They say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Our recently published consultation on performance indicators for 2002–03 proposed a reduction in the total number of indicators from 123 to 95. This represents a reduction of 23 per cent. from 2001–02".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0179">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
The first thing that any member of the Committee will do is add up the number of proposed indicators to see whether or not it actually comes to that wonderful 23 per cent. reduction that was being boasted about in the White Paper. Those hon. Members who have done their homework will have checked and discovered that there are significantly more than 95 indicators. In fact, there is a reduction of only about 12 indicators, which is 12 or 13 per cent. The reduction in indicators is not anything like proportionate to that which the Government had the temerity to boast about only a few months ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Government have spent so much time on the matter, have they sensibly decided to introduce some of the new indicators that everyone has been clamouring for, and have they decided to reduce and remove some of the indicators that people said were a complete waste of time? Was there any logic in their decisions? Those are my questions to the Minister. I have difficulty understanding some of the proposals in the report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take corporate health as an example. It is now proposed that a timetable be established for the preparation of a community strategy that replaces the old local Agenda 21 indicator. When I look at the details of that proposal, I cannot see any sign of whether the principles that underlay LA21 are to be continued and whether someone will check that they are. Nor can I see any reference to corporate crime and disorder reduction strategies, which used to be there. I should be interested to hear whether those two issues are being measured under the new indicator.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the concern of many of our constituents about the way in which their councils behave, I wonder whether the Minister could explain why it has been decided to drop the issue of maladministration. Why is it no longer considered a relevant measure of performance? We are all desperately concerned about turnout at local, and national, elections. Many members of the Committee will have made speeches that say that a real test of the health of local democracy is turnout in local elections. I cannot for the life of me understand why the Government have decided that turnout in local elections is no longer considered a relevant indicator of the corporate health of an individual council. That said, I welcome some of the new measures under corporate health, not least the measure on energy performance in council buildings, although I confess, as a former physicist, that I have some difficulty understanding the measure that was chosen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On community safety—safety on our streets and so on—which the Prime Minister said is vitally important, and will be high on the Government's agenda, we look to see whether that is reflected in the changes being made to the indicators. I wonder, not least in respect of the recent report on the impact that speed limits can have on road safety, why information on road casualties has been dropped as an indicator of community safety, when I should have thought that it was crucial to it. Why are the Government no longer remotely concerned about safety in the premises and buildings owned by local authorities? That used to be a specific indicator, as one would reasonably expect,
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
because they are the buildings and properties over which they have the greatest control. That indicator would show that they are taking seriously making their buildings and premises safe, yet it has been dropped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is strange that direct attention is drawn to violent crime. I welcome that new indicator, but any local authority following the Government's guidance on the new indicators would have difficulty knowing what they mean by violent crime, as no definitions are provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A bizarre set of changes has taken place for transport performance. The Government know that we all want a significant improvement in the use of public transport to solve congestion problems on the roads. A barrier to the use of public transport is the lack of information about it. For example, in the city of Perth, in Australia, when a relatively small sum of money was spent advertising what public transport services were available, the ridership went up by a staggering 14 per cent. without any change in the service or the quality of service provided, just as a result of making information about public transport available. However, for some strange reason, the indicator for people's satisfaction with public transport information has been dropped and I shall be interested to know why.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is perhaps not surprising that the indicator for the satisfaction with bus services has been dropped, because the Government are clearly conscious that the latest figures show that not only are people increasingly dissatisfied with public transport and the railways, they are also growing increasingly dissatisfied with buses outside the capital city.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Lepper 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brighton, Pavilion)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask the hon. Gentleman to consider not being quite so sweeping in his statements about buses. I draw his attention to Brighton and Hove where, for the past six years, bus use has increased by 5 per cent. each year, year on year. Despite there being a £1 flat fare across the city, it has not deterred people from using the buses. I ask the hon. Gentleman to refine his comments about their appeal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that the hon. Gentleman has had an opportunity to talk about success in encouraging the use of the buses, because the more we can promote those successes, provide information about them and encourage other local authorities and bus companies to follow the example, the better for all of us. I accept that good practice coexists with bad practice, and that we should share good practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will acknowledge that after the bus summit of November 1999 the Deputy Prime Minister set several targets for reliability and punctuality on the buses. The Government's own research now shows that we are nowhere near meeting them. Nationwide and on average across the country, satisfaction with bus services is declining, notwithstanding good practice in particular parts of the country. The issue of satisfaction is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government took a peculiar decision on housing benefit. Many hon. Members have complained about the enormous cost of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0180">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
administering the system. An indicator of councils' ability to control costs and ensure satisfaction has been in existence until now, so will the Minister explain why, bizarrely, it has been dropped?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Adrian Sanders 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Torbay)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has my hon. Friend noticed the peculiarity that an authority that has not transferred its stock will be judged on the performance of its housing department, so the indicators could act as an incentive for an authority to transfer its stock? Frankly, authorities should not be placed in that position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. He would doubtless agree that the tables are strongly stacked against local authorities that want to hold on to their housing. All the incentives seem to be directed towards large-scale voluntary transfers. My hon. Friend will know that at the current rate, more than 50 per cent. of former housing stock will be in the hands of registered social landlords by 2004. The disincentives to which he referred simply add to the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be delighted to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will be a constructive intervention. One problem with the hon. Gentleman's position is that a competent, even excellent, local authority in the housing sector can guarantee that any attempt to use large-scale voluntary transfer will be a failure because the competence of the authority will be such that the tenants will vote against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the hon. Gentleman's point, but I am sure that you, Mr. Atkinson, would not want us to embark on a detailed debate of the merits of large-scale voluntary transfer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have already made clear my concerns about several of the indicators—some added, some dropped. I could cite other examples, but I do not want to bore the Committee rigid by going through a list of further points. The Government have marginally reduced the number of indicators, but I see no clear logic behind some of the changes. We still end up with a highly bureaucratic, cumbersome and, perhaps most worryingly of all, highly centralised system. Central Government are determining the decision-making process about whether a council is considered a good one. My party believes that local people should take that decision and should determine the criteria by which any judgments on authorities are made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sanders</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the classic examples is planning performance indicators. Indicator 1 is the percentage of new homes built on previously developed land—a wonderful aspiration nationally and one that a local authority would wish to achieve. However, it says nothing about whether the homes being built truly meet local need. That is the real issue in new house building. Local need is more important than what type of land is built on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. We all know that we have the lowest number of new housing starts since before the 1930s. One of our main problems is the lack of availability of affordable housing. We all want to see the development of brownfield sites for such housing, but local authorities face many constraints, which make it difficult. You would rule me out of order, Mr. Atkinson, if I went into further detail, but it could lead us on to debate greenfield development tax, the powers available to local authorities to specify amounts of affordable housing and the final decision on 50 per cent. discount council tax for second homes, which I hope to hear about in the comprehensive spending review. I could go on. My hon. Friend certainly makes a fair point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Nottingham, North gets fed up with hearing clichés from the hon. Member for Cotswold. My cliché would be about rearranging the deck chairs on the proverbial ship, but I shall not say it because it would be too naff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister, who is new to his brief and will have studied these matters in great detail, will address my point about environmental indicators. Do the eight environmental indicators before us mean anything whatever to him? Is the English and grammar used in the indicators correct? Without reference to his officials or without waiting for a note, will the Minister tell me what is meant by
	<br><blockquote><p>"The percentage of the total tonnage of household waste arisings which have been land-filled"?</p></blockquote>
What are these arisings? I am totally confused.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.7 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to serve under you, Mr. Atkinson, and I welcome the Minister to his new position. I hope that he enjoys it, but anticipate that he might find it difficult at times, particularly if he has to promote a cause such as the one before us today. I welcome the participation of the hon. Member for Nottingham, North. As Government Whip he had a fascinating time when the Local Government Bill 1999 went through. As his Ministers were being minced, he left and sat outside because he was too embarrassed. As I cast my eye over today's list of performance indicators, it is clear that the Government have not learned much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When debating the 1999 Bill, the Opposition, including the Liberal Democrats, accepted that best value was a good idea that followed on from competitive tendering which, when it became compulsory, tightened the thinking of many local authorities, brought them into line, took the steam out of the argument and produced better services for many authorities. It also introduced opportunity for artful dodgers who, unfortunately, have continued under the present system. Perhaps that explains why the Government are adding bureaucracy to bureaucracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the indicators do not make sense, are counter-productive and will not work. Yesterday I attended a large meeting of the Surrey police authority at which not only the top people in the police authority, including the chief constable, were present, but most of the chief executives of most of the local authorities in the area. When I informed them about
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0181">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
this Committee and the promised new series of indicators, the groan from the whole room was phenomenal and the look of dismay was incredible. It was not because they did not want new incentives to produce a decent service: every chief executive present, regardless of the political affiliation of the authority, wanted to achieve that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Surrey police authority is certainly providing a good service: although it receives the lowest funding per policeman per head of population, it manages to achieve some of the highest standards in the country. As the motto goes, Surrey is the safest place in the country, notwithstanding being next door to London and the additional pressure the police authority faces from the Met getting heavy with London criminals. Its success is built on the freedom it used to have to think laterally, to approach matters differently and not to be tied down by central bureaucracy. The arrival of a wheelbarrow-load of bureaucratic nonsense is rather sad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had an indication of that nonsense a week ago when I asked the Prime Minister—in spite of a few interruptions and although he was not really listening—to explain why the paedophile unit at Scotland Yard had been drastically reduced. Under the Conservative Government it had a staff of 17— which is still too low—and when Labour came to power that figure dropped to 15 and then 13, of which eight are operatives. That reduction took place in a climate in which, as recent BBC2 films have shown, there is a bigger demand and a greater work load. When one asks the police about that they say, "Well, when we slip on any of our targets we have to take policemen from somewhere to try and meet them". As a result, they cannot act in an area that they believe is important because they are squeezed on finances, on the number of policemen and policewomen and on the number of operatives who are computer specialists, for example—they have all been taken off to meet those blessed targets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Exactly the same happens in Surrey, where policemen have to think laterally to provide the services that they believe necessary for the area while trying to meet the nationally developed targets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen McCabe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Hall Green)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I simply want to ask the hon. Gentleman whether he wants to give the power of the chief constable to transfer officers from a paedophile unit to other operational areas—if it is true that that is happening—to someone else? Who does he think would be better placed to make such operational decisions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am rather disappointed that the hon. Gentleman cannot see the point. Perhaps it is the fact that English is a second language for me, nevertheless I am sure that he could understand it. The chief constable is being forced to make operational decisions to meet targets that have been imposed on him. I endorse the argument of my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold for authorities, whether health, police or local authorities, to have greater freedom to meet the targets that they feel are appropriate in their local area and which local people support and have based their voting decisions on. Surrey is a classic
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
example of that lack of freedom; we have a strong Conservative council that is having financing and targeting decisions imposed on it by national Government. That is not correct and it should not happen. That even happens in other tiers of local authorities. Some heavily Conservative central London authorities—I can think of one obvious example—are under the squeeze from the Greater London authority, with the Mayor above it and central Government above that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ludicrousness of such situations can be seen from some of the indicators that we are discussing. I mentioned the one about the cost of waste collections per household. Westminster decided some years ago that it would have an improved service; its service is now probably better than that of any other local authority in the country. It collects waste centrally more often than anywhere else in the country—which means, under indicator No. 6, that the cost of waste collection per household would be very much higher. The indicator would go against the council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several other cases interest me. I shall pick a few, from schedule 6. Indicator No. 1 concerns security and
	<br><blockquote><p>"whether the authority has a written and pro-active strategy for combating fraud and error",</p></blockquote>
and so on. Everyone is in favour of stopping fraud and wants a proactive strategy, but the Government's thinking is all about process rather than results. It would be more sensible to look at results because if they are positive, the local authority would have a proactive strategy—whether written or not. The thrust of most of the indicators encourages local authorities to spend all their time finding ways around the targets. Some indicators are counter-productive for individuals. One indicator is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The percentage of applications determined in line with the government's new development control targets".</p></blockquote>
One of the problems with that is that a decision, whether right or wrong, is a decision and it will help local authorities meet their targets. As they come to the tail end of the year, one can imagine them rushing decisions merely to achieve the targets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The indicator on the elderly at home relates to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Older people (aged sixty five or over) helped to live at home per 1,000 population aged sixty five or over."</p></blockquote>
English was mentioned earlier and although it is my second language, so to speak, I know that the grammar presents problems—or at least in this case the repetition. The main point is that local authorities want to ensure that the figure is higher so that they achieve their targets and the Government's aim, although it may not be appropriate for their population. Why should they do that when they could provide a home help service for people in their homes? Some individuals may be better off, for example, in sheltered accommodation. The incentive is to make care of the elderly meet the targets, not to fulfil the needs of elderly people. That disturbs me, so I support the suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold. I did not know that he would make such a proposal, but I have been thinking along the same lines. The armies of auditors throughout the country that work for local authorities and the Audit
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0182">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
Commission should be targeted at the bottom echelons of local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some local authorities are appalling and offer a derisory service to their local people. Their charges are outrageous and they spend too much time trying to get round regulations and efforts by any Government to progress. The Government have occasionally moved in on those authorities. I believe that action has been taken in, for example, Walsall. It was long overdue and it is not the only local authority that requires such action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should use the expensive armies of bureaucrats and auditors to target those at the bottom of, for example, local and police authorities and let those above off the hook to get on with the business that is appropriate for their area. However, they cannot do that. The Government have to stand on everybody, impose a central direction and drive, and take a Stalinist approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the order will be accepted and I am saddened by that, but only half as saddened as are the local authorities, police authorities and people throughout the country who will have to implement it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.18 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister(Mr. Christopher Leslie)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Atkinson, for calling me to speak today. I am a little taken aback by the penultimate sentence of the hon. Member for Mole Valley (Sir P. Beresford) about Stalinism. That is overkill and I urge him to reflect on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I try to tackle the many questions that hon. Members have raised—the order is manna from heaven for those who wish to make long speeches—I want to define best value and to whom it applies. Best value requires all local authorities in England and Wales to secure continuous improvement when exercising their functions. They must have special regard to the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the services that they provide for their communities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister let me intervene?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leslie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make some progress, but I shall give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is kind. I ask the Minister to turn to page 15 and indicator 1 of schedule 5, which is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The proportion of unfit private sector dwellings made fit or demolished as a direct result of action by the local authority."</p></blockquote>
When the Chairman and I served on a local authority in south London we targeted such dwellings. Therefore, the proportion available to carry out the indicator is exceptionally small. Like it or lump it, that particular local authority cannot meet that target.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leslie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised at the hon. Gentleman thinking that having a target of continuous improvement in—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leslie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that he did not say that, but that is the essence of best value. If he is suggesting that the aim of continuous improvement in performance is somehow wrong or misguided, then I will have to disagree with him fundamentally. It is extremely sound to have a target of increasing the proportion of unfit private sector dwellings made fit or demolished as a direct result of action by the local authority. It is a target worth having. We must consider how and why certain services are undertaken by local authorities, how we challenge them, how we compare their performance against other providers, how they consult with their stakeholders, community members and so on, and how we test the competitiveness of service delivery within the wider marketplace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practice, best value as applied in England requires authorities to review services on a regular basis and report their performance to stakeholders, including local people, via the best value performance plan each year. They need to have accurate performance data, be prepared to set themselves challenging yet realistic targets and be able to measure their progress against them. If authorities are to secure best value, they need to know where they are and where they are going.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the order today—it is the third to be laid before Parliament—sets out the statutory best-value performance indicators which authorities are required to report against and any standards to which they need to aspire. The order sets out measures for all the key services delivered by local authorities, which include education, social services, transport, housing, environment and others, and provides a rounded view of this performance by focusing on outcomes and outputs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The indicators we have selected are good predictors of local government performance, so enabling all stakeholders, local people and the Government to see that they are getting good value for money. We could not, nor would we want to, set indicators that measure performance across every service for which local government is responsible. We developed a set of indicators, including corporate health indicators, which seek to show how authorities measure up as good democratic institutions, but also service delivery indicators covering the broad range of services for which local government is responsible, both on their own and in partnership with other bodies. Local people have a right to receive high-quality services in whatever region or locality they reside. By knowing what the levels of performance are, we hope to be able to drive up performance standards for all to those of the best.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before setting the indicators, extensive consultation is conducted not only with the representatives of "best value authorities" in general, but also with the whole local government community. All "best value authorities" have an opportunity to express their views on the proposed sets of indicators and targets and these views are taken closely into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An effective organisation, and the best councils, show that lasting and relevant service improvement is rooted in dialogue, not just with service users but with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0183">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
the community at large. To ensure that such dialogue is meaningful, any organisation relies on having hard data on which to inform their decisions. Performance indicators that are easy to understand and provide key information for local people are an essential element, therefore, in the two-way exchange with local people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the Minister that there must be a two-way dialogue, but if that is so, why does the order drop indicators that are about two-way dialogue? For example, why does an order about dialogue drop customer satisfaction indicators on public transport information, local bus services, planning application services, litter-cleaning services, recycling, waste disposal facilities and others? I entirely agree with the Minister on the need for dialogue and communication, but the measure removes the very indicators that cover such issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leslie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I heard the hon. Gentleman the first time that he raised that matter and I had intended to return to it. The survey of satisfaction indicators that he is talking about are not necessarily undertaken every year, but sometimes over a three-year cycle, so some of these matters may be returned to in the financial year 2003–04. I will discuss later the principle of not over-egging the requirements to make returns, but ensuring that we get the balance right. We do not necessarily need them every year. I shall return to the rationale, but the Government do not believe that it will be necessary every year. However, local authorities are perfectly free to undertake whatever performance indicators they wish to set, and many do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the first review of the best value regime since the Local Government Act 2000. Will there be any further reviews and when are they likely to be conducted? Will the Minister ensure that the performance indicators are as objective as possible? Many of the indicators are subjective and do not give an absolute and accurate measure of one council against another. It is the judgment of one person against another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leslie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that central Government tend to examine the performance indicators and required returns each year. That is why the order is before us today and, as I will come on to in a moment, we have managed to reduce the numbers of required performance indicators. I am always open to suggestions about clarification and simplification of the language and terminology used in the indicators and I accept that the process is continuous. However, I do not agree that the set is over-subjective. As far as statistical requirements can ever be, this is a methodologically robust series of indicators.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has not quite answered the question. Will he tell us whether we should expect an annual, biennial or quinquennial order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leslie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I will not. I shall review progress as it occurs and hold a dialogue with local government and other stakeholders involved in the best value system. The Government will examine that dialogue and make changes as and when they are necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
I was discussing best value performance indicators in general and wanted to set out the principle that they provide the basis for accountability for the communities and stakeholders concerned. Demonstrating outputs and outcomes achieved for communities enables communities to hold local authorities to account. The indicators are also important as a key management tool, while information for organisations, whether they are in the public, voluntary or private sector, helps support and focus their planning and management capabilities. Performance management and, therefore, performance indictors are integral to the delivery of high quality public services and to their continuous improvement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate what the Minister is saying and why he is saying it, but at least under compulsory competitive tendering, one could compare a local authority with another authority or the private sector. However, in many areas, particularly in London, we are comparing the dreadful with the awful. There is no incentive to move forward because private sector competition has been deliberately cut out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leslie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Comparative performance is always a difficult subject and requires a lot of attention. Best value indicators allow people to judge comparative performance between local authorities as well as an individual authority's comparative improvements from one year to the next. It does not preclude attention to improvements in efficiency, effectiveness or economy of services, but allows comparisons in questioning services and whether they are best provided by a particular means. Best value does not preclude performance comparisons of local authorities with other forms of service delivery. However, we are examining the outcomes for service users, because that is what matters most. The issue is not only the structural mechanisms of service delivery, with which I know that the hon. Gentleman is concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leslie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make some progress, as the hon. Gentleman has raised other points and I want to respond to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the last time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leslie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is learning fast. He answers the question that he wishes I had asked rather than the one that I actually asked. He is talking about comparisons between local authorities. There is a distinct drive against comparisons with the private sector that might induce a better performance from local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leslie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many local services are not provided by the private sector, so are not easily compared with it. I understand the hon. Gentleman's point. He presided over an era of compulsory competitive tendering as a Minister and hankers after it. If the official Opposition oppose the order or pray against it, it would be interesting to know whether they seek to return to such an era. The hon. Member for Cotswold may mention that point when he winds up.

	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
I turn to the rationalisation of performance indicators for which the order provides. Performance indicators are not a phenomenon of best value alone. Local government has reported performance against a range of indicators since 1993, when the hon. Member for Mole Valley was a Minister and the Audit Commission was first given a power under the citizens charter initiative to set national indicators for local government. By the financial year immediately before the introduction of best value in 1999–2000, the set of Audit Commission indicators had grown to a total of 241. Early into best value, the Government acknowledged in a response to calls for local government changes that there were too many centrally prescribed indicators. We were able to reduce the total number of indicators to only 97 for single-tier authorities in this financial year by focusing on outputs and outcome measures, and ensuring that indicators act as key predictors of performance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will come to the point raised by the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster) shortly. Local government generally welcomed the developments in response to the consultation exercises conducted last November. The Government recognise that local authorities must meet their local priorities, and we have encouraged them to develop their own local indicators and targets to help them in that process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On user satisfaction surveys, the views of local people who are the consumers and taxpayers of the services are fundamentally important. All providers must know what their customers want and expect from them. We therefore developed a set of public satisfaction and expectation surveys. By operating the surveys on a three-year cycle, authorities will be able to measure their performance over time. I hope that that answers the point raised by the hon. Member for Bath.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want local authorities to aspire to be the best and to deliver high quality services. It is important that central Government have the ability to set standards and targets, but we want local authorities to take responsibility for themselves. That is why the Government are limiting the prescribed standards and targets. We want to encourage local authorities to set their own local targets, but to take account of local priorities so that they can decide their own pace of performance and improvement. The indicators reflect the promises that we made when the principles of best value were enacted. Indicators in the statutory instrument embrace many of the suggestions that hon. Members made in debate: the need to develop indicators that reflect cost, quality and public satisfaction; the need for locally determined indicators to reflect particular priorities in certain neighbourhoods; and the need to keep to a minimum the use of nationally determined standards and targets. There is clear evidence that best value is working. Analysis of the performance data from the financial year 2000–01 shows that local authorities have embraced best value, and there is much to encourage us. There have been improvements in a range of services. Some 80 per cent. of all councils are showing
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
improvement against a basket of indicators, and the gap between the best and worst performing council is narrowing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister obviously wants, as we all do, a narrowing of the gap between the best and the worst council against each indicator. Will the best value inspection service pay greater attention to councils that are performing badly? That is surely the way to ensure that we lift up the standards of poorly performing councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leslie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that that is obvious from all that the Government are doing. We want to focus particular effort on poorly performing authorities. Best value performance indicators is one of the ways in which we can tell which are the worst performing authorities, because they give us feedback and show us which authorities are not doing as well as others. We have made changes that have improved the performance of local authorities. That was echoed in the Audit Commission report "Changing Gear", which showed that 40 per cent. of services inspected were judged to be good or excellent and 50 per cent. were deemed likely to improve. There is still a long way to go, but local government performance culture has in general changed for the better. Most councils are now more open about their performance, and authorities recognise the value of performance information in enabling them to be more in touch with communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cotswold criticised best value indicator number 11 in schedule 3 on special educational needs statements and how quickly they are issued. Rather peculiarly, he gave that as an example of something that was overly bureaucratic and not necessary as a performance indicator. However, many parents are extremely concerned about how quickly SEN statements are issued, and it certainly matters to the children concerned whether and how quickly they get the extra support that they need. The measure is also an important management tool because it shows authorities how well they are performing in speeding the SEN statementing process, and where they need to target their resources more effectively if they are under-performing. I am, therefore, surprised that the hon. Gentleman criticised that indicator; in my view, it is extremely important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also talked about the cost of the best value regime in general. Again, I am surprised that he believes that it is somehow a waste of money for local authorities to strengthen their corporate structures and performance management systems. I believe that ensuring that we have good management, leadership and corporate structures in local authorities throughout the country is extremely important. Yes, there will be initial costs in getting things right, but I do not believe that they will necessarily recur every year. Indeed, the whole point of the order is to reduce the number of indicators from the previous system, which will help to reduce the costs imposed at national level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Best value indicators will indicate poor performance. The hon. Gentleman asked when intervention powers were last applied. He will be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0185">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
familiar with the problems that the London borough of Hackney faced and the intervention that took place there. In addition, the recent Audit Commission report on Walsall, which the hon. Member for Mole Valley mentioned, recommended action and intervention, and those matters are being actively considered. Intervention powers can be used if necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bath asked many questions and I will try my best to answer as many as possible in the short time left. I ask my hon. Friends to bear with me, hopefully not for too much longer. The hon. Gentleman said that there had not been a 23 per cent. reduction in the numbers of best value performance indicators. When we mention that figure, we are talking about the statement on numbers that apply to single-tier authorities. I can assure him that no council is now required to report against more than 97 performance indicators. That is the bottom line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked about the logic of reducing the numbers of performance indicators and the rationale that the Government have used for thinning some of these out. We have certainly tried to keep the performance indicators that are predictors of key national priorities and we have tried our best to remove more process-oriented measures. For example, on waste collection, the number of missed bins per 1,000 of population might tell us about the management and contract arrangements for an authority, but they do not necessarily tell us about outcomes. I accept, however, that these are points for debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another principle is that we want to move from nationally set performance indicators to more locally set PIs, and local authorities certainly have the ability to consider how they might monitor their own services. However, in many ways the most important principle used for thinning out PIs is that we do not want to duplicate information collection requirements. A vast amount of data that the Government require is provided by the Office for Standards in Education, and contained in some of the financial returns received in revenue outturn forms, the forwards assessment frameworks from health and social services departments, and housing strategies. We do not always want to duplicate that information requirement in performance indicators. We want to ensure that we reduce bureaucracy. I accept that 189 indicators were burdensome, and reducing that figure to only 97 strikes the right balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bath asked about corporate health performance indicators. The changes to some of the indicators that he mentioned related to reducing duplicative bureaucracy in the community strategies target that he also mentioned. He asked why we were dropping the targets on maladministration. The Audit Commission and the comprehensive performance assessment will already pick them up, so dropping them avoids duplication.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Information about election turnout is available elsewhere for local government and local electors. On community safety targets, the hon. Gentleman also asked why we were dropping the target on road safety casualties. Performance indicator No. 3 in schedule 9 shows that it is still included and has not been
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
dropped. On transport in general, I talked about how the surveys are collected every three years, so they do not necessarily appear in the order. On housing benefit, the information to which the hon. Gentleman referred is collected in other reports. On the word "arisings", I am given to understand that it is a technical term, and there is guidance on its use.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And the grammar?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leslie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Mole Valley mentioned the bureaucratic nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leslie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must make progress. The hon. Member for Mole Valley talked about the bureaucratic nonsense that he sees in the imposition of performance indicators.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. Will you advise us whether it would be in order for the Committee to pass a statutory instrument if it were found to have relevant grammatical errors?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is not a question for the Chairman, but for the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leslie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And it is not necessarily a question for the Minister, although I am confident about the wording of the order. I am sure that it makes sense to those what understand these matters. [	<i>Laughter</i>.]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Mole Valley is not being generous enough in recognising the virtues of the order. We are trying to reduce the number, which is important. As I said, the Audit Commissioner had more than 200 performance indicators when he was a Minister, which shows us how reducing the numbers can be more helpful to local authorities. The hon. Gentleman makes important points about law and order. However, the order does not include police service indicators, about which he complained. It is therefore not appropriate to talk about those today. The results in the indicators are not wholly focused on process. The hon. Gentleman mentioned one from schedule 6, but as my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North pointed out, the other five in that schedule are highly focused on outcome. He says that we should focus on poorly performing authorities. That is precisely what best value indicators do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Paul Beresford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Another problem was logic. Performance indicator No. 5 in schedule 7 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The number of kilograms of household waste collected per head."</p></blockquote>
Is a local authority better if it collects more, or less? With regard to performance indicator No. 2, many people are in favour of composting, but many local authorities, especially those in rural areas, are trying to persuade their residents to compost in their own back garden rather than permit, or even insist, that the local authority does it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Leslie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is significant logic to collecting less waste that cannot be recycled and must be sent to landfill. Waste minimisation is an important principle, with which I hope that the hon. Gentleman agrees. We want to recycle more and that is why the targets have been set down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V010P0I0186">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
The order reduces the number of best value performance indicators and, all in all, creates a far more efficient and effective system for performance management in local authorities. It focuses on continuous improvement; I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret that I failed to follow the usual courtesies earlier by not welcoming you to the Chair, Mr. Atkinson, or the Minister to his new job—although it is the second time in a week that we have sparred across the Committee Room. Both occasions have demonstrated that the Government are producing ever more centralising measures. Whether or not the word that my hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley used was correct, the import of what he said is true. Local authorities should be able to exercise their discretion; the Minister said that he wanted local targets, but he cannot have local and national targets. If we did, we would run into a plethora of bureaucratic targets for everything that we do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister could not say whether we would have an annual, biannual or quinquennial order but he will need to consider the matter carefully. Priorities change and the targets will become out of date within a year; he therefore needs to look at how often the matter is reviewed. I repeat that some of the indicators are badly written. The Minister quoted my example of item 11 of schedule 3. Of course we are all interested in special needs—what politician could fail to be interested in them? My point is that the indicator is badly drafted. It asks for a percentage of statements and then excludes some cases and includes others. If one wants to know how many statements are excluded, one should just ask that question; one should not ask for a percentage of statements and then qualify that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another example of a badly written indicator is item 1 of schedule 6:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Security: whether the authority has a written and pro-active strategy for combating fraud".</p></blockquote>
If an authority does not have a written and proactive strategy for combating fraud, the Audit Commission will be after it. The item continues,
	<br><blockquote><p>"which embraces specified initiatives including those sponsored by the Department for Work and Pensions, which is communicated regularly to all staff."</p></blockquote>
Again, if an authority does not comply with directives issued by central Government, the Audit Commission will soon want to know. In addition to that, what is the point of communicating every Government initiative to all staff? It would, for example, be a complete waste of paper and time to communicate initiatives on work and pensions to members of a local authority who work in the planning department. Some of the indicators are badly drafted and the Minister will need to return to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the issue of badly drafted indicators, the Minister could not give me an opinion on the grammar of schedule 7, so perhaps the hon. Gentleman could do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I was on the Environment Committee, the phrase "waste arisings", which is a technical term, arose regularly. While the hon. Gentleman wants plain English in this and every statutory instrument—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The term is a technical one, which those involved with waste collection will understand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Foster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer also to the use of "have" in the schedule to refer to "percentage"; "has" would be more appropriate. Indeed, it is the only correct word to use in that context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that matter, the hon. Gentleman may well be correct. It is perhaps another reason why he may want to turn up next year— [	<i>Interruption.</i>] If the hon. Gentleman will listen to me for a moment, I will tell him that he may press the Minister for an annual order so that we may return to a similar Committee in a year's time to correct such grammatical errors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need more flexibility in the best value regime. We want to encourage the worst councils to come up to the standards of the best. I urge the Minister to do that by encouraging the best value inspection service to target the worst-performing authorities—and to continue targeting them. If they do not improve, the service should go back and demand to know why not. If, as the Minister says, 50 per cent. of those targets are subject to improvements, I am surprised that special orders have been taken against only two councils. We should be much more proactive against those worst-performing councils. Every citizen is entitled to expect a good level of local service from their council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition think that the best value regime is too bureaucratic. It is too expensive. It is too onerous, particularly on councils that are performing well. We shall look carefully to see how the Government could reduce the bureaucratic requirements and the costs. That £175 million is not producing the improvements that we are entitled to expect for that huge sum. The Government need to look carefully at that. Having listened carefully to what the Minister had to say, we shall not vote against the order. However, we shall watch what the Government do. We may want to revisit the subject and vote against it in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
