Draft Pathogens Access Appeal Commission (Procedure) Rules 2002</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department (Ms Rosie Winterton)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Pathogens Access Appeal Commission (Procedure) Rules 2002.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the draft Court of Appeal (Appeals from Pathogens Access Appeal Commission) Rules 2002.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to serve in Committee under your chairmanship, Mr. Griffiths. I am pleased that the two orders will be discussed together. They were laid before the House on 11 June 2002. Although there is no statutory requirement to consult on either order, we consulted members of the judiciary about the Court of Appeal rules. It may help members of the Committee if I explained how we came to be in such a position in respect of the Pathogens Access Appeal Commission (Procedure) Rules. A review of terrorism legislation preceded the introduction of the Terrorism Act 2000, which meant that many of the powers needed to protect United Kingdom citizens were in place.<br><br>
However, following the events of 11 September last year, the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 expanded those powers to take account of the changed threat. One measure was the result of the need for better security when dealing with pathogens and toxins. Many hospitals and universities hold dangerous disease stocks in laboratories for research purposes and there is a need to ensure the security of those stocks and, in particular, those who have access to them.<br><br>
There is now an obligation under the Antiterrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 on occupiers to notify the Secretary of State before any dangerous substance is kept or used on their premises and to comply with any reasonable security requirements that the police may impose after an inspection. There is also a requirement on occupiers to provide the police on request with the names and other details of people who have regular access to dangerous substances.<br><br>
Under section 64 of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001, the Secretary of State may issue directions to an occupier to require that any person can be denied access to dangerous substances when that is in the interests of national security or public safety. Section 70 of the Act provides for the establishment of the Pathogens Access Appeal Commission to hear appeals by individuals—such as students, doctors or researchers—against the Secretary of State's decision to deny them access. The commission will need to consider high classification intelligence material and ensure that information is not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
disclosed that would be contrary to the interests of national security, the detection and prevention of crime or in any other circumstances in which disclosure is contrary to the public interest.<br><br>
Paragraph 5 of schedule 6 to the Act sets out the practice and procedure to be followed in appeals to the commission. The Act also provides for further appeal from a decision of the commission heard in England and Wales to the Court of Appeal on a question of law with the permission of the commission or the Court of Appeal.<br><br>
I turn now to the draft Pathogens Access Appeal Commission (Procedure) Rules 2002, which govern the commission's procedures. I wish, in particular, to draw the attention of members of the Committee to the rules provisions. Under rule 6, individuals may bring an appeal before the commission within six months of the Secretary of State issuing directions denying them access under section 64 of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001.<br><br>
When the commission considers it necessary, appeals may be heard in the absence of the appellant; that is covered by rule 18. That will primarily be necessary when the Secretary of State has objected to the disclosure of certain material to the appellant. In such cases, the Attorney-General will appoint a special advocate to represent the interests of the appellant, as under rule 8. That is to protect the rights of the appellant without compromising any sensitive information that might form part of the Secretary of State's opposition to the appeal.<br><br>
The special advocate represents the interests of the appellant by: making submissions to the commission in any proceedings from which the appellant or his representative are excluded; cross-examining witnesses in any such proceedings; making submissions to the commission in any part of the proceedings from which the appellant and his representatives are not excluded at the invitation of the commission; and making written submissions to the commission.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Cash <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stone)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister explain how the special advocate would represent the appellant? Schedule 6 states that:
<br><blockquote><p>"A person appointed under this paragraph shall not be responsible to the applicant whose interests he is appointed to represent."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I need to examine that point in more detail. The special advocate will represent the interests of the appellant. I am not sure that the exact wording used by the hon. Gentleman would cross over in the way that I set out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I help the Minister? It is true that under the procedural arrangements covered by paragraph 6(1) of schedule 6 of the Act, it states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The relevant law officer may appoint a person to represent the interests of an organisation or other applicant in proceedings in relation to which an order has been made".</p></blockquote>
However, my point arose in paragraph 6(4) of schedule 6. I seek clarification.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman explain exactly which paragraph he quoted?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0084">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister has the same Act as me, the paragraph is on page 110, just above schedule 7. We may be able to deal with the matter later, but I wished to raise it at this stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that what we are talking about is the fact that the special advocate is appointed to represent the interests of the appellant, but the advocate is not legally liable to the appellant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As far as I am concerned, that is exactly the problem that arises. The one thing that is usually inherent in any legal proceedings is that when a barrister represents somebody in court, the client naturally expects that the barrister will be responsible to him, as would a solicitor; the client may be paying his fees or the case may be covered by legal aid. I am not trying to be difficult; I am trying to understand. We cannot do anything about a distinct difference under the Act. I wished to question the reference that the Minister made, because I suspect that the proceedings will be examined carefully in due course, as lots of problems may arise in relation to judicial review.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be reassured if I say that the proposal does not exclude the appellant's legal representatives, who will work closely with the special advocate in ensuring that the points that the appellant wants to be made are made through the legal representative. The special advocate can be privy to information in presenting a case. It would not necessarily be appropriate, because of national security interests, for that information to be passed back to the legal representative and the appellant. The liability will lie between the appellant and his legal representative. The special advocate is not legally liable in respect of the appellant. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will understand that we are trying to ensure that the appellant's interests are represented even when national security interests prevent the legal representative from appearing before the commission at the same time.<br><br>
Under rule 12, the commission also has the power to consolidate or hear together two or more appeals when the same question of law or fact arises or it is otherwise desirable to do so. That provision is designed to prevent the possibility of several separate but essentially similar appeals being mounted at the same time by people affected.<br><br>
Those are the key provisions of the procedure rules. I shall now set out in more detail the draft Court of Appeal (Appeals from Pathogens Access Appeal Commission) Rules 2002.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister omitted to mention that the chairman will have the power to take important steps in giving directions. It is unusual when setting up such a small commission—in this case, consisting of three members—for the powers to be conferred on the chairman of the commission or what will effectively be a senior judge who is a member of the commission. The question of what powers he will exercise in relation to someone who appears before him is important. Why did she not mention that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The chairman of the commission—who, as the hon. Gentleman says, will be someone who
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
holds high judicial office—will be able in the first instance to direct how the appeal is to be heard. That does not mean that the appeal will be heard by one person. The other members of the commission will be appointed later. I should have thought that it was not unusual for such a leading member of the judiciary to direct how the appeal was to be heard.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The power to give directions under article 13 may be exercised in the absence of the parties. Therefore, directions will be given, albeit by a senior judge or whoever. We understand the reasons behind that and have a lot of sympathy with the objectives, but questions of natural justice must be complied with under the Act. As the Minister knows, such matters must be consistent with both the convention on human rights and the rules of natural justice; parts of these proposals seem pretty close to infringing those.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I note the hon. Gentleman's comments. The power of the legally qualified chairman to give directions is the same as the power conferred by the Proscribed Organisations Appeal Commission rules. Some of these cases are difficult and involve national security. I assure the hon. Gentleman that, in my opinion, both these rules are compatible with the European convention on human rights.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Heath <span class='memberconstituency'>(Somerton and Frome)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that the commission can rule on nondisclosure in the same way as can be done under the POAC rules. Is there not a difference between the general duty of the commission on the one hand and the POAC and Court of Appeal rules on the other? One of the four tests applied in the POAC rules and by the Court of Appeal concerns the UK's international relations. That has been dropped in these rules; why?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have been very patient so far, but interventions are supposed to be short, not long and complicated. I should prefer Members to make their own speeches and to stop punctuating the Minister's speech with mini-speeches.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure what the hon. Gentleman means about international relations being dropped, but I may come back to that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heath</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was referring to part I—"general provisions"—paragraph 3(1), which includes national security and the detection and prevention of crime, but not international relations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether they are covered by "any other circumstances", but I will certainly get back to the hon. Gentleman on that. In a previous debate, there was some discussion of what "any other circumstances" meant. We believe it important that the chairman of the commission, a senior member of the judiciary, should be able to make directions, so that these specialised and difficult matters can be speedily dealt with.<br><br>
The Court of Appeal rules before us today apply to proceedings before that court when it hears an appeal against a decision of the commission. The provisions for the Court of Appeal (Appeals from Pathogens Access Appeal Commission) Rules 2002 are set out in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0085">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
paragraph 5 of schedule 6 to the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001. The Court of Appeal rules are straightforward. They are required to ensure that the Court of Appeal secures
<br><blockquote><p>"that information is not disclosed contrary to the interests of national security, the international relations of the United Kingdom"—</p></blockquote>
which relates to the point made by the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)—
<br><blockquote><p>"the detection and prevention of crime, or in any other circumstances when disclosure is contrary to the public interest."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not running counter to what the Minister is saying, but this is an important exchange because we are taking the two orders together. Will she throw some light on the fact that article 3 of the procedure order states that
<br><blockquote><p>"information is not disclosed contrary to the interests of national security … crime, or in any other circumstances where disclosure is contrary to the public interest",</p></blockquote>
but rule 4 of the Court of Appeal order requires that the court
<br><blockquote><p>"must secure that information is not disclosed contrary to the interests of national security, the international relations of the United Kingdom, the detection and prevention of crime"?</p></blockquote>
In other words, why is there a distinction between those two orders in respect of international relations?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I said, I will return to that question if I can, but will write to members of the Committee should that be necessary. I will seek further advice on the matter. Issues may arise that relate to a particular employee whereas, in the Court of Appeal scenario, other things may have to be brought before the court that would have a greater effect on international relations. It is felt that, at the commission level, such matters can be covered by "any other circumstances". I take on board the point that has been made and, if necessary, will write to hon. Members with further information.<br><br>
Appeals to the Court of Appeal are only on questions of law. Questions of fact, which are more likely to give rise to issues of disclosure, will have been considered by the commission already under its rules of procedure. Those rules provide for detailed procedures for deciding whether material can be disclosed. The Court of Appeal may exclude from proceedings any party other than the Secretary of State and his representative. The Court of Appeal's discretion to exclude a party from proceedings can be used only if it were necessary to ensure that information was not disclosed contrary to the public interest. Furthermore, there is provision in the Antiterrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 to allow for the appointment of a special advocate by the Attorney-General to represent the interests of a person excluded from proceedings.<br><br>
I thank you, Mr. Griffiths, for giving me the opportunity to provide that explanation. I am happy to respond should hon. Members wish to raise other points. I commend the draft procedure rules and the draft Court of Appeal rules to the Committee, and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
confirm that they are compatible with the European convention on human rights.</span></p>
<p>4.54 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The rules are very important and nothing that I say or have said should be construed as implying that I do not agree that the rules are necessary. However, the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 requires consistency with the rules of natural justice. I would fail in my obligations if I did not try to highlight several points that, if they do not give rise to anxiety, need a full explanation.<br><br>
By way of preamble, an exchange between Lord Rooker and Lord Dixon-Smith questioned whether the words,
<br><blockquote><p>"the security of any country or territory outside the United Kingdom"—</p></blockquote>
that is, external relations, and not simply national security—should be included. I hoped that the words would be accepted. When considering extremely dangerous substances and biological weaponry, we should not distinguish between national and international security. That has been borne out by all the events to which we have been exposed since 11 September and, in my opinion, long before then.<br><br>
As long ago as the 1980s, I went to the United States and visited a large laboratory. The senior laboratory expert told me that it already had materials that would remain neutral unless triggered. He said that one simply had to begin the first stage, and drop a line to inform the potential enemy that if he did not do what was required, one would activate the second trigger. No one would be any the wiser because they would be quickly dead. I do not know whether that could happen today. However, that is so dangerous that I do not want to oppose the order. I cannot understand the reason for confining ourselves to national security when international security is part of that.<br><br>
In the Rehman case, Lord Hoffmann stated that
<br><blockquote><p>"in matters of national security, the cost of failure can be high."</p></blockquote>
That underlines the need for the judicial arm of Government to respect the decisions of Ministers of the Crown about whether support for terrorist activities in a foreign country constitutes a threat to national security. That was a recent House of Lords case, and is therefore authoritative. It emphasises the importance of the fundamental and final questions that arose in it, and stressed that national security was a matter for Ministers of the Crown because they are accountable. We should bear the importance of that in mind.</span></p>

<p>5.13 pm</p>
<p><i>On resuming—</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I just want to go briefly through the individual rules to air my concerns and I invite the Minister to respond.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0086">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
In terms of rule 4 of the appeal commission rules, I have already alluded to information not being disclosed
<br><blockquote><p>"contrary to the interests of national security"</p></blockquote>
as opposed to international relations. I have no need to repeat that; no doubt the Minister will give a written reply.<br><br>
Rule 4 deals with delegated powers. With respect to the Minister, it is not only the chairman who should necessarily be a senior Law Lord. That should apply to any other member of the commission who falls within the rule. I am concerned to get it right. The chairman will have important powers in terms of directions and applications for permission to appeal. I do not understand why that should be left to one person when there are provisions for the commission as a whole. The commission is small. The Government appear to be trying to hold this back in too tight a circle.<br><br>
Rule 8 relates to the special advocate. Paragraph (1) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"the law officer … if he thinks fit to do so, appointing a special advocate to represent the interests of the appellant in the proceedings."</p></blockquote>
I already made my point about what the rule says, and the Minister's reply is on the record.<br><br>
On rule 12, I understand that there could be circumstances in which there are two or more appeals to be put together. Equally, plenty of people could easily argue that each case is different, and it would be difficult to claim that this was justified.<br><br>
On rule 13, I already dealt with directions and the fact that the power to give them is given to a tight circle and, in some instances, only to one person. The power to give directions will be exercised in the absence of the parties.<br><br>
Rule 18 relates to proceedings in private. We understand many of the reasons for that, but we need to know the parameters and the extent to which difficulties could arise. The rule raises important questions.<br><br>
Rule 19 relates to evidence. Paragraph (3) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Commission may receive evidence that would not be admissible in a court of law."</p></blockquote>
I should be interested to know what that is supposed to cover. After all, matters of national security are at the top of that agenda, but I must also ask about international relations.<br><br>
On the Court of Appeal (Appeals from Pathogens Access Appeal Commission) Rules 2002, I already made a point about rule 4 on national security and, on this occasion, the inclusion of international relations of the United Kingdom. With regard to the extent of the rules, I think that I am right in saying that the appeal commission procedure rules apply to the whole of the United Kingdom. I may be open to correction on that. However, the other rules do not extend to Scotland and Northern Ireland. Will the Minister clarify that? I understand why they may not, because of the judicial system in the devolved Administrations. However, I ask the Minister for an assurance that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
equivalent rules will be introduced to apply to Scotland and Northern Ireland.<br><br>
I know that we have devolved government but, equally, when we are dealing with pathogens, the borders between Scotland, England and Wales are not that far away. I want to be sure that we have a consistent and uniform approach, so that we eventually have a United Kingdom framework, albeit making allowances for the devolved system of government and the judicial process.<br><br>
That is all I have to say, and I look forward to the Minister's reply.</span></p>
<p>5.19 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heath</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Griffiths, despite your earlier strictures. It is the first time that I have done so.<br><br>
We are discussing an extremely important pair of statutory instruments, not only because of the national and international context and security issues that are raised, but because of the human rights issues involved. We must get it right. When taking steps to protect our liberal democracy and the lives and well-being of not only our citizens but citizens around the world against the threat of terrorism, it cannot be in the interests of this country for that liberal democracy to be undermined by a removal of human rights without us being aware of what is involved and careful that such restrictions are consistent with the needs of national security.<br><br>
That sets the scene, and having said that, I should be clear that, like the hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash), I see the need for legislation to protect us from the threat of pathogens and toxins. Indeed, they pose a more realistic threat than some others that are often discussed. Unless we put robust legislation in place, we are doing a disservice to the people of this country. We should take that as read, and instead examine the substance of the rules.<br><br>
I start with the last point of the hon. Member for Stone. It is important that we have a consistent approach. I assume that because reference is made to a United Kingdom Secretary of State, English courts will deal with the matters irrespective of the geographical situation of the premises. I may be wrong about that, and it would be good to hear the Minister's confirmation.<br><br>
I would be interested to know the workings of the orders. I understand that a specific order is put on the occupier of premises to prevent access of a specific person. Can that restriction on a person be extended to a class of premises, or is a different order necessary for each building that may contain the pathogens or toxins in question? If an order against one person is needed for each building, there is a danger of proliferation of appeals, which would not be in the interests of the judicial system.<br><br>
We have already had exchanges about the mysterious disappearance of the reference to the international relations of the UK from the rules relating to the commission. If that change was made deliberately because of the difficulties of interpreting the expression, I welcome it. The rules on appeals from
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0087">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
prescribed organisations have been debated, and there is a serious question about the definition of what is in the interests of the international relations of the UK. For instance, would that include considering the pressure, which might be considered inappropriate, from a friendly power that may not have the same attitudes to either legal systems or the appropriate way of dealing with potential miscreants? I can conceive of many Governments around the world who might seek to apply that pressure and affect the judicial proceedings in this country. We should ignore that pressure, but it could clearly fall within the terms of the interests of the international relations of the UK. Therefore, I feel that the rules are on much sounder ground on the other definitions that they apply, save for the open-ended prescription of "any other circumstances".<br><br>
I understand why such a prescription is needed, as one does not want to go back to the legislative drawing board when certain circumstances arise. However, I am concerned about the ability to challenge the interpretation. There have been several cases in which Ministers of the Crown have interpreted national interest in a specific way and a court has held otherwise. I am not clear where within the structure the assumptions that are made, by the commission or the Court of Appeal, can be challenged elsewhere.<br><br>
Perhaps the Minister will tell me that the only appropriate vehicle for such a consideration is an appeal to the House of Lords. I should be grateful if she explained. Decisions taken, whether to exclude people from the hearings, to appoint a special advocate or on anything to do with the procedures adopted, must be capable of judicial scrutiny or review at some point, so that an opposing case can be made. It is not clear how that will be done.<br><br>
The other major concern is the ability of a Minister of the Crown to appoint a person to represent an individual in proceedings at appeal or before the commission. Again, we have previously raised with Ministers the question of whether it is right that a single person should be appointed in the circumstances without the prior agreement of the appellant. Perhaps it would be more appropriate for a list of appropriate persons to be provided by the Minister, so that the appellant had at least some discretion as to how they were represented.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Stone made a point about the duties of the special advocate to the appellant, and that matter is also unclear. It is all very well to say that the appellant will have their own legal representatives, but those representatives will not have access to the material evidence used in the case. Therefore, their ability to represent a case appropriately is limited. People will have no access to the proceedings of the tribunal either, so it will be beyond their power to know whether they have been adequately represented. There might have to be clearer responsibility on the part of the special advocate in the interests of the appellant.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
I have two other points. The orders have the potential to make a citizen of this country unemployable in their trade or profession. A pathologist, medical technician or scientist could be held to be a danger under the provisions of antiterrorism legislation. They could then be excluded from the premises in which they carried out their trade or profession. I do not know whether there is any remedy for the individual under those circumstances, whether the case for exclusion is well founded or not. The Minister might look at that to see what the consequences might be in employment law or elsewhere of the effective exclusion from trade or profession.<br><br>
The second point is that we are dealing with novel procedures. They are not entirely novel, as there are precedents, but both in this case and that of prescribed organisations the procedures are not the normal procedures of the court system. Will the Minister tell me whether there are any proposals for review of the procedures at a suitably high level within the judiciary, to ensure that they are working as effectively as possible? That would be appropriate a relatively short time after the systems were introduced, so that an assessment could be made of whether the procedures were working to the satisfaction of the courts, the Secretary of State and those who are proscribed under the Act.<br><br>
Most important is the danger that the provisions will be perceived, either here or abroad, as being a dereliction of the human rights of the individual. I do not say that they are. I say merely that there is a risk of that happening; a perception that is built on the fact that, in the first instance, it will be a Minister, and not a member of the judiciary, who will determine that the direction should be made. A Minister will determine whether matters can be disclosed to the appellant; could they be called the accused? A Minister will determine who should represent that person. A Minister will tell us that that is all compatible with the European convention on human rights. It is not impossible to construct a view that that may be a dangerous set of circumstances, and that people might suspect that what was being done was not in the interests of natural justice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have taken a slightly different path. I repeat what I said about Lord Hoffmann's judgment. No one in the House of Lords is more vigilant on human rights than him. A few months ago, he stated that
<br><blockquote><p>"the need for the judicial arm of government to respect the decisions of Ministers of the Crown on the question of whether support for terrorist activities in a foreign country constitutes a threat to national security".</p></blockquote>
It is crystal clear that decisions have to be taken by Ministers of the Crown.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heath</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not dissent from that view, and I have the greatest respect for Lord Hoffmann. I am saying that that construct, which places within the hands of the Executive so many of the powers that would normally be accorded to the judiciary could be construed as being an affront to human rights. Whatever safeguards we can build in to prevent that construction—or misconstruction—of the apparatus
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0088">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
for that procedure would be well advised. That is what I ask Ministers to do, not only within these orders, but with similar procedures. Whenever possible, we must ensure that suspicions do not arise that the Executive is effectively acting as prosecutor, judge and jury in its own court.</span></p>
<p>5.33 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Rosie Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been interesting and searching debate on what is obviously an important subject. Opposition Members have indicated their general support for the Government's approach, although they have raised a number of issues.<br><br>
The hon. Members for Stone and for Somerton and Frome mentioned the Rehman case. That case clearly showed that people have the opportunity to take their appeals to the highest level. We are trying to ensure—in difficult circumstances, because of the nature of the information that the commission and the Court of Appeal will have to consider—that we build proper rights of appeal into the process, although there will inevitably be some constraints.<br><br>
In connection with the effect of the rules on international relations, it has been mentioned that there are some differences in the different rules. In the Court of Appeal (Appeals from Proscribed Organisations Appeal Commission) Rules 2002, reference to international relations was made in relation to the commission. We were looking at that example in considering international organisations, and it was felt that it would be appropriate to include a similar reference in the commission rules. In addition, it was felt that it would be appropriate to refer to the issue of international security in the Court of Appeal rules because there may be less familiarity with the issues of national and international security.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Stone referred to the judgment in the Rehman case, which stated that it was difficult to distinguish between national and international security because the implications of national security so often extend into the international field.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heath</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for attempting to explain that, but I do not find her explanation convincing. Is she saying that different determinants and different material will be adduced on appeal from that which goes before the commission? That would seem to be a novel procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I was not saying that. I was saying that the same phraseology has been used in these rules as in the POAC rules because it was felt important to highlight that issue—especially because of the international situation and the implications for international security—but not that different evidence would be used. As I said before, the Court of Appeal will consider points of law, as opposed to previous disclosures.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This could become an extremely protracted discussion, but I shall not be tempted down that route. As the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome has said, one of the orders deals with the appeal. If the question of international relations will go before the Court of Appeal, and if the Court of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
Appeal is confined to questions of law, that means that questions of law in relation to international relations will be raised only on the second leg. It is extremely difficult to understand exactly why those matters should be excluded from the first leg. I suspect that we will go round and round in circles on that issue, which is why I think that the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome is right in suggesting that these matters should be kept under review.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The rules will not extent to Scotland and Northern Ireland, and the Court of Appeal has jurisdiction only in England and Wales. Schedule 6 to the Act provides that the commission may sit
<br><blockquote><p>"at times and in such places as the Lord Chancellor may direct."</p></blockquote>
The expectation is that it will sit in England, so it is not necessary to extend the rules to the Court of Session and to the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland. Hon. Members will recall that the issue was raised in the previous debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am quite surprised by that remark. For the reasons that we have given, it is quite extraordinary that we should exclude equivalent rules in Northern Ireland and Scotland, and I think that the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome agrees. There may be sound reasons for doing so, and the Minister has mentioned judicial systems, devolved government and reserved matters. Surely, such sensitive matters cannot give rise to appeals to the Court of Appeal in England and Wales, when appeals will be excluded in Northern Ireland and Scotland, which will have no equivalent system. Or have I misunderstood what the Minister said?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has misunderstood what I said. The Commission will sit in England, and the appeal will therefore always be made to the Court of Appeal. The commission will not sit in Scotland or Northern Ireland, because it sits where the Lord Chancellor directs it to sit. It is not that an appeal would not be allowed if it sat in Scotland; the point is that the commission is expected to sit in the English jurisdiction.<br><br>
The issue of special advocates was discussed at some length in the previous debate on POAC. I made it clear at the time that appellants who were not satisfied that the special advocate was an appropriate person to represent them could make representations to that effect, which would be listened to. Under the POAC rules, organisations have the right to make objections, and individuals may do so under the present rules. As yet, however, there have been no objections under the POAC procedures to the appointment of a particular special advocate. Special advocates are people of the appropriate vetting standard, who are experienced in such matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am terribly sorry to have to mention this, but section 70 of the Act refers to arrangements in which the special advocate will be somewhat engaged. It clearly states:
<br><blockquote><p>"A party to any appeal under this section which the commission has determined may bring a further appeal on a question of law to—
<ol>
<li>the Court of Appeal, if the first appeal was heard in England and Wales;</li>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0089">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
<li>the Court of Session, if the first appeal was heard in Scotland; or</li>
<li>the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland, if the first appeal was heard in Northern Ireland."</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
The Act therefore provides for equivalent systems to be set up, so why are we not told that there will be equivalent arrangements in Northern Ireland and Scotland? Given the nature of the United Kingdom framework, and the danger of these pathogens, should we not ensure that we have a consistent system? I suspect that the answer is that the Minister should write to me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, the answer is not that the Minister should write to the hon. Gentleman, but that the commission sits where the Lord Chancellor directs it to sit and it will sit in England. If the Lord Chancellor were to direct the commission to sit in Scotland or Northern Ireland, appropriate rules would have to be drawn up to cover that, but the Lord Chancellor establishes where the commission will sit; if it sits in England, the court rules need to be from England. The hon. Gentleman will understand that there is a lot of sense in that. There will probably be very few cases and this course of action would be suited to the building up of casework, if it were necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heath</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Am I right in thinking that the absence of any rules of procedure for the Court of Session or the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland requires the Lord Chancellor to direct the commission to sit only in England, notwithstanding the terms of the original legislation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I have said, if the Lord Chancellor were to direct that the commission should sit elsewhere, different rules would have to be made. We do not envisage that the commission will deal with enormous numbers of cases. It is therefore appropriate for it to sit in England.<br><br>
The hon. Members for Somerton and Frome and for Stone raised the question of reviewing the rules. We have no plans to review the rules and we do not think that they would fall within the scope of the review to be conducted under section 122 of the Antiterrorism, Crime and Security Act 2002. However, it would become obvious if the system were not working correctly and needed to be reviewed.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome also raised the issue of the employability of an individual. Our approach to the matter is designed to give an individual the right to challenge any decision, so we consider such protection to be provided within the framework.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Stone, if I recall correctly, also raised the issue of evidence that could be used by the commission but would not apply ordinarily. I hope that the Committee understands that where consideration is being given to issues such as national security, the commission will sometimes have to take into account hearsay that would not be admissible in other situations. That will be part of the way in which information is put together for the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
Secretary of State to decide whether an individual poses a problem in terms of working in this difficult area. That is why that statement is made.<br><br>
I hope that I have reassured hon. Members that we are trying to initiate an approach and establish the permission and the ability to take an appeal to the Court of Appeal. We want to give the individual the right of appeal to challenge the Secretary of State's decision in unusual and difficult circumstances. I am grateful for the support that hon. Members have given in that matter.<br><br>
If further information is needed on any issue, I shall be happy to write to hon. Members. However, I hope that they give support to the rules, which I commend to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cash</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the rules had been introduced seven years ago and were based on some time previous to 11 September, organisations that involve themselves in questions of liberty and justice would have shown greater interest and there might have been an outcry. It is a measure of the seriousness with which the public at large has received the events of 11 September and its aftermath that the orders have been treated in a much lower key than they might once have been.<br><br>
None the less, I am worried to hear the Minister say that there is no provision for a review if the measures do not work properly. The Council on Tribunals, or a body of that kind, may be able to consider the rules. A Select Committee might examine how they worked in practice to ensure that everything was right; that process might involve the Joint Committee on Human Rights.<br><br>
Yesterday, in a sitting of the European Scrutiny Committee, we discussed with Lord Filkin the attitude of the Government on the balance between national security and human rights. We had an interesting session on that subject. The Government clearly suggested that, although they were not prepared to admit that they were going to diminish human rights, the assumption that human rights should prevail over every other consideration was put in the balance.<br><br>
In respect of the orders, other questions relating to the rules of judicial review, natural justice and so on are also being put in the balance after having regard to the nature of the threat. The balance should serve the interests of the public at large and national and international security. I am glad to note that although there are many Labour Members in the Room, they are not disposed to express reservations about some elements of the proposals. It has fallen to Opposition Members to raise questions about natural justice and judicial review. We have not asked trivial or unimportant questions; our questions have been important.<br><br>
We shall not oppose the order, but there remain some unresolved questions. Time will tell, but a review may be the best way of dealing with the matter.</span></p>
