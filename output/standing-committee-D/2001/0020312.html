Draft National Assembly for Wales (Representation of the People) (Amendment) Order 2002</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Paul Murphy)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft National Assembly for Wales (Representation of the People) (Amendment) Order 2002.</p></blockquote>
I welcome you, Mr. Taylor, to your position as a member of the Chairmen's Panel and wish you well in it.<br><br>
The draft order was laid before the House on 14 February 2002. It amends the National Assembly for Wales (Representation of the People) Order 1999, to bring legislation governing elections to the Assembly in line with legislation for parliamentary and local government elections in Wales. The changes are required as a result of the provisions of the Representation of the People Act 2000, the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 and the Representation of the People (England and Wales) Regulations 2001.<br><br>
The main changes the order makes are: to allow voters to vote by post without giving a reason for doing so; to provide blind voters with a device that will assist them in voting without the assistance of a companion, if they so wish, and to allow persons with other disabilities to vote with the assistance of a companion; to ensure that the 1999 order is consistent with the new arrangements for rolling registration; to accommodate new controls on the expenses of political parties set out in the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000; to accommodate the changes made by that Act concerning the description of registered political parties and independent candidates on nomination forms and ballot papers; and to make other consequential amendments to achieve consistency with the amendments to the Representation of the People Act 1983 about the conveyance of voters to polling booths and the use of school buildings as committee rooms.<br><br>
My officials have worked closely with their Assembly counterparts on the order, and Assembly Ministers have been kept informed. Furthermore, the changes made by the order have been the subject of consultation with the Electoral Commission, which supports them.<br><br>
All the changes are important, but the changes dealing with postal voting and voters with disabilities are likely to be of the widest interest. Postal votes will be accessible to all who wish to use them. That positive step will encourage the electorate to take part in elections, by giving them more options for voting.<br><br>
The changes also mean that all voters with disabilities will now be entitled to the assistance of a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
companion. Previously, such assistance was available only to blind voters. As well as providing that each polling station should be equipped with a device to allow blind voters to cast their votes unaided, if they so wish, the order provides for the display of a large-format ballot paper to assist visually impaired voters. The provisions are in line with those in force at the last general election, which were well received by disabled voters.<br><br>
The order will make a number of important changes to the Assembly's electoral process, but further changes are required. Therefore, I propose to introduce a further order, which will include new provisions relating to candidates' expenses, the broadcasting of local items during an election period, the publication of exit polls and false statements in nomination papers. Additional consultation will be required on those topics before I can introduce a further order. However, the second order will be laid before Parliament well in advance of the next Assembly elections on 1 May 2003.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Llew Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Blaenau Gwent)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support all the ideas for making it easier for different groups to vote at Assembly elections, and I am sure that the Assembly will welcome them, too. However, does the Minister think that we may still have a problem, not just with these groups but with the electorate as a whole coming out and placing their X? We were told that the Assembly would make a bonfire of the quangos. As hon. Members know, that has not happened. This is not just about improving a little here and a little there; it involves the whole question of whether people are going to vote.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the points that my hon. Friend has made, is making and shall continue to make for a long time, but they are not wholly relevant to the order. However, he is right to mention turnout, and I can make a general point about that. The low turnout that we experienced in every seat in the general election and that we saw in the by-election in Swansea, East, although less so in Ogmore, concerns all parties. It is important to do whatever we can in this House to change the way in which people vote, to maximise turnout.<br><br>
The draft order's contents ought not to be contentious. It brings the Assembly elections into line with parliamentary and local government elections in important aspects such as accessibility to postal voting and assistance for voters with disabilities. All the changes are in the interests of increasing enfranchisement and, as I just said to my hon. Friend the Member for Blaenau Gwent (Llew Smith), of encouraging our electorate to use their votes. I urge the Committee to approve the draft order.</span></p>
<p>10.36 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Greg Knight <span class='memberconstituency'>(East Yorkshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I start by associating this side of the Committee with the remarks made by the Secretary of State in welcoming you to the Chair, Mr. Taylor? I understand that this is the first Committee that you have chaired. Long may you reign over us, even after the next election, when we will be sitting on the other side of the Committee.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0116">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
I thank the Secretary of State and his ministerial colleague for their courtesy in giving the official Opposition details of the ministerial notes on the order. Such actions are nothing but helpful and if other Ministers followed the practice of those at the Wales Office I think that the Government would not be in the trouble that they are in various areas. I hope that that comment has not blighted the Secretary of State's future career.<br><br>
The Secretary of State explained the order's scope fairly, but I have several questions. Although it brings the law in relation to elections to the National Assembly for Wales into line with that in relation to parliamentary elections in England and Wales, this is nevertheless a freestanding order and it is right that we question parts of its scope. Can he explain the scope of article 16, "Election Expenses", which refers to the expenses of constituency candidates? Does that relate in any way to the unfortunate situation that Fiona Jones got herself into in Newark in the previous Parliament? I should be grateful if he could explain why that article is necessary.<br><br>
Article 26 is about voting by persons with disabilities. Of course, we welcome those provisions, which are very important. Is any advice or direction about practice to be given to the presiding officer about their implementation? My concern relates to whether a voter who presents himself with a companion and asks if the companion can vote on his behalf is to be asked whether that is what he wants in the presence of that companion. I am concerned about the risk of duress being applied in certain cases: for example, an elderly voter may be taken to vote by a relative who has a different view of how that vote should be cast. If the voter is to be asked whether he or she wants to use the services of a companion, it is important that the presiding officer does so out of earshot of that companion to ensure that no duress is used.<br><br>
The Secretary of State said that a further order would be introduced in due course. When does he expect that to take place, and why is it not happening now? Who will be consulted? I understand that one of the problems is that the consultation process is not complete. Will he confirm that all political parties will be able to make representations before the terms of the order are finalised? Subject to satisfactory answers to those points, we are satisfied that the order is the right and proper way to proceed, and we shall not divide the Committee.<br><br>
I ask the Secretary of State to confirm that by approving the order the Committee will not be endorsing the recent decision by the Welsh Assembly to delay democracy by postponing local elections in Wales until 2004. Many of us feel that that is a disgrace, and that the local elections should have gone ahead as planned in 2003. Will he confirm that nothing we do here today ratifies that disgraceful decision, which will effectively delay the date of a Conservative revival in local government in Wales?</span></p>
<p>10.41 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Simon Thomas <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is good to hear such an optimistic note struck so early in the morning.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
However, I fear that we would need more than a year's delay to see the revival of Conservative fortunes in Wales, particularly at local government level.<br><br>
I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Taylor. I understand that this is your first job chairing a Committee, and it is delightful to see you in your place. I am sure that you will preside over many Welsh deliberations, and that you will find them much more interesting than English ones. Of course, you will be disinterested, which will be even better.<br><br>
I welcome what has been set out. I apologise to the Secretary of State for missing the first minute of his explanation, but my office was able to contact his office and obtain some background detail, which was useful. It is better that such non-contentious matters should proceed with openness of information.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Blaenau Gwent made a very good point. Through rolling registrations, easier access to postal votes and improved access for disabled people, we are trying to make the process of voting more accessible and to encourage more people to vote. It has to be said that the jury is out on that, because there was no significant increase—in fact, there was a decrease—in the number of those voting. I am prepared to give the Government and the current electoral system a little more time, and to see the order approved in its current form. However, it only brings Wales in line with what already applies in England.<br><br>
Extra ways of voting that we could consider for Wales are missing. For example, should we allow the National Assembly to hold its polls at the weekend? Polling stations could be set up in places where people might find them more accessible and be more encouraged to use them. That is not within the scope of the order, so it is a little limiting. I would have liked the Government to think more creatively about how the Assembly could win greater support from voters by changing its interaction with them. We have applied a blanket solution and we should consider more local solutions. I would like local government innovations and new ideas for persuading people to vote in local government elections. There should be freedom to do that. I agree with the right hon. Member for East Yorkshire (Mr. Knight) that delaying elections for a year is not the way to do that and I hope that that does not fall within the scope of the order. We should consider different ways of conducting elections; there is scope for innovation. My party and I would welcome a debate on those issues.<br><br>
I have some questions on the narrowness of the order. It is welcome that the provision applying to blind voters will also apply to disabled voters. During general election campaigns it is my habit to visit all polling stations in my constituency. It is a close call and takes all day, but keeps me busy and out of mischief.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Paul Flynn <span class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It gives the hon. Gentleman something to do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thomas</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed.<br><br>
When I visited the polling stations last year, I was concerned about accessibility and I must tell the Secretary of State that the device that enables blind
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0117">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
people to mark their own voting cards was not available in all polling stations, nor had all officials been trained how to use it. I have raised the matter with my local electoral officers and chief executive, but if we pass the order it is incumbent on us to ensure that some training is provided and that the devices are not kept in cupboards or behind school desks. Officials should know how to use them and encourage people to use them.<br><br>
Access to polling stations, especially in rural areas, is a wider issue and beyond the scope of the order. If the Secretary of State wants to encourage disabled people to exercise their right to vote and take a full part in the civil process, they must have access to polling stations. Regrettably, many do not have that access and it may be embarrassing for disabled people to have to vote outside the polling station, with or without a companion.<br><br>
Will the Secretary of State explain the effect of the order on students and student registration? Article 7 refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"attendance on a course provided by an educational institution".</p></blockquote>
I want to clarify whether the position of students is changed by the order and, if so, how. It is the habit of students to register in more than one place: at home and where they are studying. Hopefully, they use their vote in only one place, but we should consider the matter and I would appreciate it if the Secretary of State clarified whether the order makes it illegal or it is already illegal for students to exercise a vote in more than one place. The temptation exists, particularly when elections are held only in Wales—perhaps for the National Assembly—and no election is held in the place where the students come from.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind hon. Members to avoid reading newspapers too obviously while the Committee is deliberating.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thomas</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take it that you were not referring to me, Mr. Taylor.<br><br>
My final question to the Secretary of State concerns the amount of money set aside for by-elections, to which article 16 refers. I understand that the order covers only by-elections for the National Assembly for Wales, for which the new amount will be £100,000. How was the amount arrived at and how does it compare with the amount that was previously spent in by-elections for the National Assembly? It is limited, of course, because list by-elections simply involve moving up the list, so we are discussing only constituency by-elections for the National Assembly.<br><br>
I would be happy to support the order, subject to a response from the Secretary of State on those questions and points. I am confident that I will receive one, because he has approached the matter in an open and encompassing manner.</span></p>
<p>10.50 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the comments of the right hon. Member for East Yorkshire on the way in which we have dealt with the issue. As I said earlier, all Members of the House, irrespective of their party,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
want to ensure that people have the greatest opportunity to vote, and the order helps achieve that. I assure him and the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr. Thomas) that we will keep them fully informed of developments in respect of the future order.<br><br>
Article 16 on the election expenses of candidates is necessary to make a clear distinction between the expenses of individual candidates and of political parties. The former are controlled by the Assembly order and the latter by the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000.<br><br>
On disability and voting, the right hon. Gentleman made a valid point about the influence of the companion who accompanies a disabled person to the polling station. On behalf of the Committee, I will refer his comments to the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions. Obviously, his important point applies to all elections, not just Assembly elections.<br><br>
My officials are consulting their Assembly counterparts and other Departments on the next order. Under the new rules, we must consult the Electoral Commission, which in turn has its own consultation process. We will lay the order as soon as we possibly can, once the consultations are over and we have drafted it.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman asked about the change of date for local government elections in Wales. He will appreciate that that is a matter for the National Assembly, and I assure him that the order does not deal with it. It does not endorse or oppose any postponement of local elections but is simply about the process; however, I understand his point.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ceredigion made an important point about increasing voter turnout. He was absolutely right, and it is a matter of great concern to us all. I do not think that any constituency escaped a drop in turnout in the general election; some experienced a greater drop than others. I take his point that we should examine more imaginative ways to increase turnout. That is now a role for the Electoral Commission, which will come up with ideas to improve voter turnout. In my constituency, there were 8,000 applications for postal votes for the general election. I sometimes wonder what the turnout figure would have been without that arrangement.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned students. Under the order, students can apply for a postal vote without giving reasons or ask for a proxy if their course prevents them from visiting a polling station. That does not alter the fact that they can vote only once. As the hon. Gentleman knows, I used to be a Northern Ireland Minister. That was not always the case there, but the law is that one can vote only once.<br><br>
Expenses are increased in accordance with expenses for parliamentary elections. The order relates to all Assembly elections, not just by-elections. The hon. Gentleman also raised a vital point about training electoral officers to use devices to help blind people. We will consult the Association of Electoral Administrators, particularly in Wales, on that matter.<br><br>
