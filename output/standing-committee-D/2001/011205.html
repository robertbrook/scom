Draft Transport Act 2000 (Consequential Amendments) Order 2001</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions (Mr. David Jamieson)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Transport Act 2000 (Consequential Amendments) Order 2001.</p></blockquote>
It is a singular pleasure, Mr. Chidgey, to be under your chairmanship. This hour and a half in Committee will be the first time that I have had the pleasure of standing here under your watchful eye.<br><br>
We are considering an order that will amend certain enactments as a consequence of the Transport Act 2000. Hon. Members who were here in the previous Session will recall the 2000 Act, which began its parliamentary passage in December 1999 and received Royal Assent at the end of the following November. Among other things, it paved the way for setting up a public-private partnership, or PPP, for National Air Traffic Services.<br><br>
The 2000 Act is a lengthy piece of legislation, as those who sat on the Standing Committee considering it will surely attest, yet it formed only a tiny part of the work load of the House in that Session. Section 277 was included to enable amendments to be made, consequent to the Act, which could not be picked up in the time available during the Act's passage through Parliament. As the amendments are to primary legislation, it is only proper that they be laid before, and approved by resolution of, both Houses of Parliament.<br><br>
The order has two main purposes. First, it restores to NATS certain powers and responsibilities that it had under the Civil Aviation Authority. Secondly, it gives the CAA, in its role as an economic regulator of air traffic services, access to the same sort of information as is available to other regulators.<br><br>
As Hon. Members will recall, until 31 March this year NATS was a wholly owned subsidiary of the CAA. On that date, it was separated from the CAA and transferred to Government ownership. Subsequently, NATS was the subject of a PPP, which was completed on 26 July.<br><br>
As part of the CAA, NATS enjoyed certain benefits and was subject to certain responsibilities placed on the CAA. Once it was separated from the CAA, that ceased to be the case and the order is intended to restore the pre-separation position. Part I of the order defines who shall be taken as the authority responsible under the Aviation Security Act 1982 for the security of an air navigation installation. As the 1982 Act stands, it provides for the CAA or an aerodrome
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
manager to be taken as the authority responsible. In the light of the 2000 Act, however, section 38 of the 1982 Act must be amended to include those authorised to provide air traffic services.<br><br>
Parts II and III are designed to enable NATS to meet the operational requirements for the provision of en route air traffic services by making the licensed subsidiary of NATS a statutory undertaker and by enabling the same subsidiary—NATS En Route Ltd.—to take advantage of a more favourable planning regime. Those benefits are important to NATS. Air traffic control equipment such as radar and navigation aids must be sited precisely to meet operational requirements. Air safety and the expeditious movement of air traffic demand nothing less.<br><br>
Statutory undertaker status, powers of compulsory purchase and permitted development rights were available to NATS when it was a subsidiary company of the CAA, so I assure hon. Members that NATS is not being given special privileges. I also assure them that the benefits that the order bestows are being restricted to the licensed subsidiary of NATS—the agency through which the UK discharges its obligations under the Chicago convention to provide air navigation services.<br><br>
Part IV is less complex. Hon. Members will recall that the 2000 Act established the economic regulatory regime for the provision of air traffic services and gave the role of economic regulator to the CAA. Part IV ensures that the CAA will not be disadvantaged in its role as a regulator by giving it access to a range of information that is available to other sector regulators in the discharge of their duties. Part V merely amends the 1982 Act to reflect the repeal of sections 62, 63, 73 and 74 of that Act.<br><br>
In the short time that I have had, I hope that I have given a reasonable exposition of the order.</span></p>
<p>4.36 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cotswold)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Chidgey, for allowing me to catch your eye in this important debate. The order consists of dense legalese, which is almost impenetrable until one starts to work at the underlying Acts. Before I go into that, Mr. Chidgey, I welcome you to the Chair. This is the first time that I have had the privilege of serving under your chairmanship. I know that you will be firm, but fair, and will not allow us to stray too far.<br><br>
This piece of legalese sounds innocent and unimportant until one delves into the detail and finds that the huge powers of a non-profit-making Government organisation—the CAA—are being transferred to a company with private interests that exists solely to make a profit. Huge powers of compulsory purchase, powers to enter land without notice, powers to survey land without notice and powers to obtain almost unlimited information without anyone being able to object are being transferred to a semi-private company and we must scrutinise that carefully.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0022">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
The Committee must also scrutinise the order carefully because NATS already has great problems. How can we be sure that it will even work? The <i>Evening Standard</i> yesterday said that, to survive, NATS requires a new cash injection of some £200 million to £300 million, yet it was set up only on 26 July. If an organisation set up so recently is already in financial trouble, how can we be sure that it is right to give it huge powers under the order? The Government will say that they reserve the powers and that the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions can take over if NATS fails, but that is not the point. We need reassurance that NATS will survive.<br><br>
There is now a new company, which I had not even heard of it until the Minister told us about it this afternoon. He said that NATS En Route is a subsidiary of NATS, but perhaps he will tell us, so that it is in the public domain, exactly what NATS En Route does and what role it will have in respect of the powers being transferred by the order.<br><br>
Most importantly, having read section 277 of the 2000 Act, I must put on record my utter disgust. That section allows the Minister to transfer huge and wide-ranging powers to NATS. I ask parliamentarians to use their judgment in deciding whether it is reasonable that any Parliament should hand over such wide powers to any Executive. Section 277 of the vast 2000 Act, of which I have a copy, states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may, in consequence of any provision of this Act or of any instrument made under it, by order"—</p></blockquote>
that is what we are doing today—
<br><blockquote><p>"made by statutory instrument make such amendments (including repeals or revocations) as appear appropriate to him to be appropriate in … any Act".</p></blockquote>
On a whim, the Secretary of State may amend any primary legislation by order. I ask members of the Committee whether they want to hand over that amount of power to an Executive, without checks or balances. One day, Labour Members may be sitting where we sit; we may then use that power and they may not like it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mark Prisk <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hertford and Stortford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend shed light on a matter for my constituents? Some live under a flight path and they are concerned that the company interests of the new private NATS may cloud the decisions necessary for the general interests of the local community.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend, but he needs to remain for my whole speech, which may last up to one and half hours.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman must address the Chair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Chidgey. I was advising my hon. Friend to stay for the whole Committee and I am sure that you would endorse that. If he does so, he will receive the reassurances he seeks. The order transfers wide powers to the NATS public-private partnership.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Chris Bryant <span class='memberconstituency'>(Rhondda)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I was not a Member of the House before the general election, I would like to know exactly what view the Conservative party took on section 277 during the previous Parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would love to answer that question, but the hon. Gentleman may look up those Committee debates in <i>Hansard</i> and read a much fuller version that I can give him now. I shall desist before I go further down that line.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful, Mr. Clifton-Brown.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I always like to crave the indulgence of the Chair, Mr. Chidgey. Suffice to say that the provisions of the order, which allow the Minister to take huge powers, are too wide. I hope that current parliamentarians and those of the future never pass such a wide-ranging order.<br><br>
The Minister skirted around some powers that will be transferred, although he referred to parts II and III, which cover the most contentious powers. Under the provisions dealing with the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1976, the Acquisition of Land Act 1981 and the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, there are huge powers relating to planning, entry on land, surveying of land and, as the Minister said, reducing powers of planning.<br><br>
I want the Minister to put on record the circumstances in which he expects NATS to use those overriding powers, which are stronger than those of virtually any other statutory undertaking, and certainly stronger than those of any commercial organisation. What would happen if NATS, as a commercial organisation, used those powers at the expense of another private airport operator? It could use them under the pretext of safety or to explain commercial development in NATS. It could say that the Government have set financial targets, and that it has considered every airport in the country in respect of what might be appropriate development. It might then say that it would help others use the powers, but charge them for that.<br><br>
How do we know that NATS will use the powers reasonably, or that it will charge a reasonable amount for them? When we gave powers to other statutory undertakers, they usurped them and charged an exorbitant commercial rate for doing so. They charge not only for day-to-day running costs, but for a full cost recovery. As we know, these quasi-governmental quangos have an incentive to charge excessively. In this example, the Govt have a 49 per cent, stake while 51 per cent, is in commercial hands.<br><br>
I ask the Minister in all seriousness, when such organisations are the statutory undertaker, what controls will there be on the amounts that they can charge? What controls will ensure that they act reasonably? With almost unlimited powers, they will be able to go to court and say, "This is in the interests of air safety and efficient air safety operations as well as the development of NATS." The courts will not be able to say much about that.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0023">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
The Town and Country Planning Act 1990, which is amended by part III, is particularly contentious in respect of paragraphs 14B and 14C of the order. The CAA retains it decision-making responsibilities regarding permitted developments and building on land
<br><blockquote><p>"within the perimeter of the relevant airport by a relevant airport operator or its agent".</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister say under what circumstances it would be reasonable to use those reduced planning requirements? It seems to me that people should not be subject to planning application requirements less stringent than those required by a normal commercial operation save in an emergency. That is the only time that those powers should be used. I would be grateful if the Minister provided some clarity in that respect. Will they be used only in an emergency or on a normal operational basis?<br><br>
The 1990 Act refers not only to operations within an airport, but to reduced planning requirements up to 8 km from an airport. Effectively, what other commercial organisations do in terms of development may be controlled. That is a sweeping power, and we need to know from the Minister under what circumstances it will be used.<br><br>
Part IV, paragraphs 15 to 25, amends legislation that provides the information obtained thereunder, which may be disclosed to specific persons and bodies for specified purposes. So, there will be a huge transfer of powers to obtain information. All part IV, which covers the Consumer Credit Act 1974, the Estate Agents Act 1979, the Telecommunications Act 1984, the Airports Act 1986, the Consumer Protection Act 1987, the Water Act 1989, the Water Industry Act 1991, the Water Resources Act 1991, the Railways Act 1993 and the Coal Industry Act 1994, gives powers for this new body, NATS, to obtain information from almost whoever it wants, whatever the circumstances.<br><br>
I ask the Minister in what circumstances NATS would be entitled to demand information. Who will determine whether that information is reasonable and to whom may it be disclosed? A lot of commercially confidential information could be obtained in this way, so we want to know what use will be made of the commercial information obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Kilfoyle <span class='memberconstituency'>(Liverpool, Walton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman strays too far from the question of powers over planning, does he, like me, wonder how the proposals being entertained here today fit into the review of planning, which I understand is being undertaken by Lord Falconer? How do the two interlace? Would he, like me, be interested to hear the Minister explain how the issue fits into that broader view of planning?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful for that very helpful intervention. [<i>Interruption</i>.] No, it is very helpful, because we are approving these powers before we know what is in the Green Paper. We can rely on leaks, which this Government are good at. There have already been some about what will be in the Green
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
Paper, and we think that the powers of local authorities, and hence local accountability through locally elected councillors, will be taken away in respect of large planning applications.<br><br>
That is yet another example of local, democratic accountability being removed. Local councillors will have no control over developments that NATS might propose, because of the powers that we are giving away under the order. The hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Kilfoyle) has done us all a favour. Perhaps the Minister will give us a peek at the Green Paper and tell us how the powers in the order mesh with it, although I am not holding my breath. He may tell us whether he was, consulted on the compatibility of those powers during the drafting of the Green Paper.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patrick Hall <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bedford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of clarification, as regards part III, does the hon. Gentleman agree that local councillors do not get involved in decisions about matters of permitted development?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman had looked at the underlying Acts as I have, he would know that permitted development is not the only issue. The order also involves reduced planning requirements in respect of developments at any airport and within 8 km of an airport.<br><br>
Many of the Acts contain wide powers, although not as wide as those in section 277 of the 2000 Act. The Acts conform to a trend, in that Acts passed under Labour Governments tend to contain wider powers than those passed under Conservative Governments. When one reads all those huge Acts, one can see that trend. While Conservative Governments jealously guard the parliamentary powers that we are given by the people who elect us, Labour politicians tend not to do so. However, Mr. Chidgey, I am sure that you would soon rule me out of order if I discussed that any further.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am listening closely, Mr. Clifton-Brown.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Mr. Chidgey.<br><br>
As the Minister in the relevant sponsoring Department, what powers will the hon. Gentleman retain under the order, and under what circumstances, to control, overrule and intervene in the operation of NATS? His Department remains the only hope of retaining some control, as the order gives NATS such wide powers that most challenges in the courts over exceeding its powers are unlikely to succeed. The Secretary of State is the only person who could act as a guardian of the huge powers that are being transferred to NATS, so we need to know how his Department intends to monitor those powers. What would happen if NATS did not succeed, or the Government sold their 49 per cent, share and it became a wholly owned private company? Would the Minister still be satisfied that it should have such wide powers?<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0024">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
On another point, what does the Minister expect to be the new relationship between the CAA as the regulator and NATS as the air safety operator? What will happen if the CAA is in conflict with NATS when NATS uses powers over which the CAA no longer has control?<br><br>
Finally, at what stage are the negotiations for the so-called European blue skies directive, and how will it mesh with the role of the CAA and NATS? We cannot sensibly discuss the order unless we know about those three functions.<br><br>
I shall allow the Minister to answer those few questions, and I shall ask him another batch of questions, if necessary, after his reply.</span></p>
<p>4.53 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Tom Brake <span class='memberconstituency'>(Carshalton and Wallington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair today, Mr. Chidgey.<br><br>
I reassure the Committee that I do not intend to speak for an hour and a half, but have a few brief points to cover. As the Minister knows, the Liberal Democrats were opposed to the NATS part-privatisation, but this is not the place to go through that saga again. However, it will be no surprise to the Minister that I echo some concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) about the significant powers being given to a private operator. I hope that he will be able to tell us what checks, balances and guarantees there will for controlling and monitoring the powers.<br><br>
I also hope that, in relation to the changes made under part III of the order to class B in the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995, which I assume covers the sort of permitted development that might be needed for Prestwick, the Minister will comment on the progress of that project and the latest date by which he expects it to be under way. Like the hon. Member for Cotswold, I hope that the Minister will comment on the current financial state of NATS.<br><br>
My final point is about class H, which also appears in the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995, yet will not be subject to any consequential amendments. I would like the Minister to explain why there are no circumstances in which NATS might need to undertake surveys. Why is that simply a responsibility for the CAA? If there were a possibility that NATS might undertake surveys, I would expect another consequential amendment to be made to that order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman were to refer to the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1976, he would find that the powers that the order transfers under the Transport Act permit surveys, entry to land and boring on land without the permission of the landowner, provided that due notice is given.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Tom Brake</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. I hope that the Minister will tell us whether that is the case. With those few questions, I will sit down and await the Minister's response, which I hope will be detailed.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The debate so far has been helpful. I would like to help the hon. Member for Cotswold through some of what he described as the "dense legalese" in the order. I agree with him that it appears to be written in legalese. That is because, although the purpose is simple, a large amount of legislation must be amended in order to achieve it. There is a temptation to stray too far in a debate such as this, Mr. Chidgey, but I am sure that, as the hon. Member for Cotswold pointed out, under your careful chairmanship we will not be allowed to stray from the order.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman says that huge powers are being transferred. In fact, powers that currently belong to the CAA are being transferred to NATS. He also says that he is concerned about such powers being transferred to a private body. I must at some point go back to some old volumes of <i>Hansard</i> to see what he said during the passage of the Acts that privatised gas, electricity and water. In those Acts, the same kinds of powers were transferred to private bodies. I do not think that he would have opposed those measures then.<br><br>
The powers are being transferred so that NATS can carry out its duties under the Transport Act. The hon. Gentleman tried to claim that this was news, and that he had only just chanced upon the measures, yet the powers, and their transfer to NATS, were all set out in the Transport Act 2000.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Tom Brake</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that it might also be instructive to examine <i>Hansard</i> to see what Labour Members said about those transfers of powers then?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is always interesting to study old copies of <i>Hansard</i>, if one has plenty of time in the evenings. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman was one of those who, in their earlier days, read <i>Hansard</i> under the covers while the rest of us were out enjoying ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me complete the point first. What is happening now, as has been recommended in the past by the Select Committee and many others, is important. The CAA's role as an economic regulator is now separate from the delivery of the service, which is being carried out by NATS.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has tried to imply that in the 1990s I might have said something different from what I am saying now. I am one of those Members who jealously guards Parliament's powers. They should be given away in legislation only where absolutely necessary. The CAA's powers are such that it is able to control developments if it does not happen to like them, particularly in relation to airports, irrespective of who owns them, up to a distance of 8 km. It would be interesting if the Minister could tell us which other statutory undertaker has such wide powers.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is useful not only to have an interest in parliamentary scrutiny, but to be consistent in these matters. Many of the CAA's powers were given to it a long time ago. I am not sure which Government were in power at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In a moment. The order ensures that NATS can operate properly by transferring some of those limited powers to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Hugh Bayley <span class='memberconstituency'>(City of York)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes I will.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Hugh Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is extremely generous. With most transport undertakings, the transport operator has safeguarding powers to prevent developments which would undermine its ability to run the transport system. I may be wrong, but I seem to remember that the hon. Member for Cotswold was a member of the committee that considered the Railways Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I was not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Hugh Bayley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take that back. But that Bill contained similar powers to enable railway operators to prevent developments that would compromise their ability to develop the railways.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has re-emphasised the important point that I was making. In his earlier comments the hon. Member for Cotswold made out that the powers were somehow new and that he had chanced on something entirely fresh. These powers are well established. As he knows—he must have voted for them in the 1990s—some of these bodies are in the private sector.<br><br>
I wish to clarify the difference between NATS En Route and NATS services. NATS En Route is a subsidiary group dealing with services that are en route—moving through from one place to another. It currently operates on five sites. It aims ultimately to operate on two sites. NATS services are generally delivered from inside the aerodrome. It is not covered by this order; the order covers NATS En Route. The hon. Gentleman can take a reasonable amount of cheer from this; the ambition is to have two centres, one in England and one in Scotland. Therefore, it is unlikely that NATS En Route would need to use many of those powers extensively. However, as a responsible Government, we must give it the powers to ensure that it can carry out the services it needs to deliver to keep the free flow both to and from aircraft and over our land. They are not unusual or peculiar powers. As my hon. Friend the Member for City of York (Hugh Bayley) said, many other organisations have such powers—and that includes monopoly providers.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
The hon. Member for Cotswold asked about the charges and whether rip-offs were possible. There is a difference now in that the CAA has the role of the economic regulator, whereas previously it delivered both the NATS services and those of the economic regulator. Those functions have now been separated, as was suggested by the Transport Sub-Committee and many others.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has said something important. Am I correct in taking it that the CAA will be able to act as the arbiter when NATS uses these powers? What recourse will any aggrieved person or organisation have to ask the CAA to look into whether the powers have been used reasonably?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The CAA will act as the economic regulator, just as other regulators operate with other monopoly organisations. The same factors will obtain.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Cotswold and the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake) asked whether the order placed development rights outside planning controls. Permitted development rights transferred to NATS from the CAA are not entirely outside planning control, and in exceptional circumstances a local authority may apply normal planning controls. The planning authority could submit an order under article 4 of the Town and Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 to the Secretary of State, seeking the removal of the particular permitted development right and requiring an application for planning permission. I hope that I have reassured the hon. Gentleman that the order does not give it carte blanche, because fall-back provisions are in place.<br><br>
I do not want to stray down the same road as the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington. He asked some important and worthy questions about the progress of NATS, but if I started speaking about its financial status, Mr. Chidgey, you would call me to order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is a former Whip, and he is ingeniously making sure that he does not have to answer questions about the future of NATS. However, he must answer one important question. If NATS should fail, does the order have reserve powers allowing his Department to take over?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are confident that that will not happen, but if it did, the provisions of the 2000 Act would come into play.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Tom Brake</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is one of my questions that the Minister has not answered. I shall rephrase it, to make it clearer. If NATS needs to undertake surveys, under which of the consequential amendments or classes will it do so—or is it never required to undertake surveys?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the organisation was thought to have exceeded its powers, any person could make a claim in court. The right-of-way powers invested in the licence holder are not there only for NATS. There are safeguards.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can help the Minister answer the question put by the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington. Section 15 of the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1976 provides that
<br><blockquote><p>"A person authorised in writing in that behalf by a local authority"—</p></blockquote>
the CAA is taking over the powers in relation to local authorities for that purpose—
<br><blockquote><p>"may at a reasonable time…(a) survey any land in connection with a proposal by the authority to acquire compulsorily an interest in the land".</p></blockquote>
That is another example of the wide powers given by the order.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jamieson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. As I said earlier, it would be unusual for those powers to be widely used; indeed, they will be used only in exceptional and limited circumstances. I hope that he agrees that it is right and proper that the 2000 Act and the order should both give NATS appropriate powers to act, so that air services can operate properly and safely, as we in the Committee would wish.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Transport Act 2000 (Consequential Amendments) Order 2001.</p></blockquote></p>
<p><i>Committee rose at nine minutes past Five o'clock.</i></p>
