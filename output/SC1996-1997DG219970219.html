	<div class='legislation'>Draft European Communities (Definition of Treaties) (Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an Association between the European Communities and their Member States and the State of Israel) Order 1997</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Mr. Jeremy Hanley)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft European Communities (Definition of Treaties) (Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an Association between the European Communities and their Member States and the State of Israel) Order 1997.</p></blockquote>
The association agreement with Israel is one of a series of agreements that the European Union is negotiating with mediterranean states as part of the Barcelona process. That was launched in 1995 to promote co-operation between the European Union and the mediterranean region. Euro-med agreements are an important mechanism for strengthening economic links with the region. Their trade liberalisation provisions and the long-term goal of a Euro-med free trade area by the year 2010 will enhance the economic prosperity of the region. By doing so, it will also improve the conditions for political stability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agreements are also clearly in the United Kingdom's interests. They allow for the dismantlement of tariffs and the opening up of the economies of the region. Our trade with Israel is significant and has expanded rapidly in recent years. Last year, bilateral trade topped £2 billion, making Israel one of our top 25 export markets. The agreement allows United Kingdom companies greater access to Israeli markets. We are also a strong supporter of inward investment into mediterranean states. We shall host a major conference next month to promote investment into the region as part of the Barcelona process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Negotiations on the other Euro-med agreements are at different stages. The United Kingdom has ratified the Tunisia agreement, the Morocco agreement should come before the House this summer and we hope that agreements with Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Algeria can be concluded soon. The signature of the interim agreement with the Palestine Liberation Organisation on behalf of the Palestinian authority is due at the General Affairs Council on 24 February. We welcome the progress on all those agreements. In political terms, the Palestinian agreement is particularly important in complementing the European Union-Israel agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The EU-Israel agreement covers mainly trade and investment issues. It will create opportunities for further development of our already thriving trading relationship
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
with Israel. It also provides for enhanced political dialogue and co-operation in economic, social and financial areas. The agreement represents an important factor in our close relationship with Israel—a relationship that goes far beyond the sphere of trade. The state visit of President Weizman to the United Kingdom next week—the first by a President of Israel—symbolises the closeness of those links.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are also strong political arguments for the agreement. Support for the middle east peace process is the cornerstone of United Kingdom and European Union policy in the region. Although the Barcelona process is separate from the middle east peace process, the two cannot be seen in isolation. Liberalisation of trade will contribute to prosperity and thus to regional stability. The progress that has been made towards peace between Israel and its Arab neighbours in turn has allowed them to enjoy better relations with Europe. Our consideration of the EU-Israel association agreement comes at a significant time. The Government of Mr. Netanyahu signed up to the Oslo process in last month's agreement on Hebron. That agreement reaffirmed both sides' commitment to the Israeli-Palestinian interim agreement of 1995. We hope to see momentum maintained by tiny, further redeployment of Israeli forces as envisaged in that agreement, and progress in negotiations on other outstanding issues. The Palestinian side must continue to do all that it can to suppress terrorism and help to ensure Israel's security from attack.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The EU's agreement with Israel and the PLO will help to increase prosperity in the region. As I have said, prosperity makes an important contribution to peace. For that reason, we are concerned by the restrictions that remain on the Palestinian economy. Although we recognise Israel's right to impose measures that are necessary for its security, we believe that the damage done to the economy of the west bank and the Gaza strip since 1993 by restrictions on the movement of people and goods is a threat to the peace process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Palestinian economy must be allowed to realise its potential if popular support for the peace process is to be maintained. We have urged the Israeli Government to make rapid progress in a number of areas—in easing restrictions on the passage of goods across the Jordanian and Egyptian borders, in making arrangements for free passage between Palestinian areas, in allowing the opening of Gaza airport and the construction of Gaza port, and in tackling a range of other outstanding economic issues. We welcome the easing of those restrictions over recent months and the recent encouraging agreement on the payment of outstanding debts between Israel and the Palestinian authority, but there is still a long way to go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nowhere do restrictions bite more severely than in east Jerusalem. We have been concerned to see what appear to be attempts by the Israeli authorities to change the demographic balance of the city, not only by the closures, but by the construction and expansion of settlements around east Jerusalem, the withdrawal of Palestinians Jerusalem residency permits, and other discriminatory administrative policies, such as the constraints placed on building licences for Palestinians. Apart from humanitarian concerns, pre-empting the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0205">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
final status negotiations in that way cannot but damage the peace process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By entering into the agreement with Israel, we intensify its political dialogue with the EU and the scope for discussing issues such as these in a practical manner. The agreement will be a positive step in bringing Israel closer to our thinking on a range of subjects and encouraging the Israeli Government to follow the policies which we believe are essential to the peace process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Great Grimsby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: by entering into the agreement, we give up the negotiating counter or the pressure of hesitating about ratifying the agreement. Members of the Committee have been asked by various groups—specifically by Human Rights Watch—to make a more specific commitment that the Minister has made so far to the "respect for human rights" mentioned in article 2 of the Euro-Mediterranean association agreement. Human Rights Watch urges that
	<br><blockquote><p>"your government, in submitting the Agreement for ratification:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>specify publicly your concern about Israeli practices such as torture, arbitrary and prolonged detention … make clear that persistent and recurrent violations of human rights"—</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Will the hon. Gentleman remember that we have an hour and a half hours for our proceedings? Interventions must be extremely brief. Will he come quickly to the point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a brief intervention and I hope that the Minister's reply will be equally brief. I hope that he will say that he will make those agreements and that the Government will, as Human Rights Watch urges,
	<br><blockquote><p>"instruct the European Commission to establish a mechanism to monitor and report on future Israeli compliance".</p></blockquote>
Is the right hon. Gentleman prepared, on the Government's behalf, to accept those points?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In any speech of this kind on a subject of this nature, naturally I would have come to the issue of human rights before I had finished. Without a doubt, the subject of human rights, on both sides of the Israeli and Palestinian discussions, is vital to confidence in the peace process as a whole. Before I respond to the point—and I shall answer the question about article 2 and monitoring in due course—I should explain that the European Union, with strong United Kingdom support, is pressing ahead in discussions to establish a parallel agreement with the Palestinians. Both agreements show the commitment of European states to a constructive and long-term engagement in the region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Human rights and democratic principles constitute an essential part in all association agreements. Human rights provisions in association agreements require partner countries to respect human rights and democratic principles. They commit partner countries to meet established standards. We believe that the EU-Israel agreement will provide further scope for raising human rights concerns with Israel, providing as it does for enhanced political dialogue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) may say that we are losing a bargaining counter by accepting the agreement, but in return we are gaining a
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
mechanism in the agreement that could be used as a further item of pressure which, if terms of the agreement were broken, would give rise to a breach of the agreement. If those terms were serious enough, the agreement could be withdrawn. I regard that as an equal bargain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Union continually monitors human rights in Israel. As we speak, the heads of mission are monitoring human rights in other countries. It is vital to ensure that monitoring is as effective as possible. The human rights provisions of the association agreement reinforce that requirement. I shall raise the issue of official monitoring with those who will examine monitoring and decide how a mechanism can be established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will continue to do all that we can to support the peace process. The EU-Israel agreement and other Euro-med agreements can help to underpin that process. They grow partially out of a recognition of the steps that have been taken towards peace and prosperity. UK ratification of the agreement will be timely—the peace process is recovering momentum after a period of stagnation and we are on the eve of a state visit by the President of Israel. The agreement will be a welcome boost to the UK's important trading relationship with Israel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I catch your eye later, Mr. Lord, I shall be happy to answer specific questions. I said that I would mention article 2 and other human rights issues. However, it might be best to hear contributions from members of the Committee before doing so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.42 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Derek Fatchett 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition will support the statutory instrument and the agreement that has been reached between the European Union and Israel. The Minister made several arguments with which we would agree, but those arguments lead to points and implications that members of the Committee will want to explore in greater detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's basic proposition, which virtually everyone in the Committee will accept, is that trade arrangements offer the ability not just to enhance economic prosperity, but to bring political stability to the region. He is correct to say that the Israel agreement is not unique; other agreements form part of the broader perspective of maintaining or increasing economic prosperity and improving political stability. We share those objectives and recognise the difficulties involved in achieving them. We acknowledge the opening of trade as a means of improving economic prosperity and we understand the difficulties for some of the countries mentioned in achieving the political stability that the Minister and every member of the Committee wants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trade arrangement before us raises other questions. The Minister and I, who have been involved in earlier debates on trade arrangements, should be delighted that the instrument raises broader implications because, for almost the first time, we are not alone in the debate. On previous occasions, it has almost been just the two of us. Today, other hon. Members are present who have a clear interest in the subject. We have got rid of our lonely vigil on trade arrangements and we are delighted about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0206">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
The broader implications are the source of this afternoon's debate. The Minister is right that, in many respects, this trade arrangement is not the same as the others because it feeds into the middle east peace process. Although the two processes are not wholly related, there is a clear connection between them. That is why there is so much interest this afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister made several points, which I should like to tease out a stage further. First, he talked about economic prosperity creating the conditions for peace and progress in the middle east. That is correct. It is why it is crucial that developments in the economic relationship occur along the Palestinian track as well as with the Israelis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the peace process is to work, we must be able to prove to the average Palestinian, as well as to the average Israeli, that there are gains to be made from the process. For the average Israeli, such gains might be made through economic prosperity and through security. We are right to stress that and must continue to do so. For the average Palestinian, the gains are made through the achievement of a set of personal and national aspirations and through being able to prove that the peace process brings an important economic dividend to Palestine—to the west bank and Gaza.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The economic figures since Oslo make depressing reading. The argument that peace brings prosperity does not apply with any great merit if we examine the experience of people who live in the west bank and Gaza. According to the best available estimates for the west bank and Gaza—they are likely not to be as good as the unemployment figures that we might argue about here—unemployment is between 35 and 50 per cent. Roughly speaking, one person in three or two is unemployed. I suspect that those figures are ambitious, especially in relation to Gaza. According to recent figures, average domestic wage levels in the west bank and Gaza fell by 20 per cent. in real terms in 1995. From 1992 to 1995, the real gross national product of the Palestinian economy fell by 23 per cent. and it was expected to fall by 6 per cent. last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those figures show that there has been no immediate economic dividend from the peace process. I am sure that all Committee members will want to discuss trading difficulties for those who live in the west bank towns and Gaza as well as the problems that they have in taking up employment in Israel. Such issues are crucial to the economic well-being of the people who live in those areas. Although we recognise that there are security considerations, there must be a balance. One of the messages that the Committee would want to give to Israel is that while the security balance is struck, so the prosperity balance has to be struck in the other direction, too—those who live in the west bank and Gaza must have the prospect of having an opportunity to share in the dividends of the peace process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister pointed out that the process has been made easier since the recent agreement on Hebron. That is clearly the case and it has changed beneficially the atmosphere, but the process must continue. The crucial point about the deal was that it recognised the nature of the middle east peace process. I am sure that certain
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
hon. Members think that a better deal could have been struck, but its crucial point was that it maintained the process and progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Israeli Government signed up to that process with the support of three-quarters of the Israeli people and a large majority in the Knesset. That is important progress, but we now need—and the trade arrangement is our way of saying that this is even more important—to continue the peace process and to ensure that the next stages of withdrawal from the west bank and the final phase negotiations begin, so that we reach a real, lasting and just peace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Achieving that will be a difficult task, and no one here will fail to recognise the complexity of the issues—but the Minister was absolutely right to say that no additional hurdles should be placed in the way of that process. I warmed to his words when he warned of the risk of opening more settlements on the west bank and in east Jerusalem. Opposition Members share that opinion. Settlements would be provocative and are unnecessary in this context. They would make it much more difficult to reach the agreement that is crucially important for all sides in Israel and in the west bank and Gaza.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference has already been made to human rights. That is an important issue and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby said, members of the Committee have been lobbied on that issue. There is no point repeating the comments that my hon. Friends have already made. Human rights concerns do exist and the Minister rightly acknowledged that those concerns do not relate only to Israeli actions because human rights violations have been carried out by parties on both sides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been concerned for some time about how we monitor the human rights provisions of the trade agreements. When we make agreements with countries whose human rights records do not match up to those of European Union countries, it is crucial that we take a firm line, not only in words but in monitoring the process. I applaud the fact that the Government have tried to take a lead in Europe on that issue. It is crucial that we continue to take a lead because the trade arrangements will be used for purposes for which we do not wish them to be used if there is no strict control of the human rights records of the countries with which the European Union makes trade arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that when the Minister replies to the debate, he will speak about the importance of the human rights monitoring process and the need for the standardisation of such agreements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As, in a couple of months, my hon. Friend will be sitting on the other side of the Committee and Conservative Members will be sitting on this side, it would be useul if we gave similar undertakings.

My hon. Friend referred to the importance of continuous monitoring and I absolutely agree with him. I hope, therefore, that he will give his reaction to the three specific points raised by Human Rights Watch, and in particular to the question of a Labour Government's insistence that some machinery is in place to monitor the human rights record of both sides.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Fatchett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I always defer to the political wisdom of my hon. Friend. Of course, he is right that there will be a change round in the Committee because we shall soon be sitting on the other side. I thought that he was unduly pessimistic in saying that some Conservative Members would be sitting on these Benches. I suspect that he got his sums wrong and that, in fact, one or two of them may well be sitting in the Public Gallery enjoying the quality of a new Labour Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend raised a serious point about the commitments that we will be keen to give. We have always said that human rights will be an important element of the foreign policy of a Labour Government. That commitment applies to these trade arrangements. I have already been vigilant in ensuring that we will push the monitoring process. Europe needs a much more effective monitoring mechanism to ensure that the parts of the agreement dealing with human rights are properly implemented and that future developments are observed. My hon. Friend the member for Great Grimsby made an important point about future perspectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important agreement. I know that several of my hon. Friends wish to speak and I am sure that several Conservative Members also want to do so. I shall not detain the Committee further except to stress the fact that we cannot overstate the importance of economic development and of the need for a long-term, peaceful political settlement. That settlement must ensure that Israelis have the right to live in peace and security and that Palestinians have the right to live in peace and with economic prosperity and justice. That should be our united objective. We must ensure that the peace process continues and that people living in the middle east have the right to what we expect as an everyday part of our political and economic life: peace, prosperity and security. If the agreement contributes towards the attainment of those goals, it is an important step forward and, despite all our doubts, cautions and provisos, we should support it. I am sure that my hon. Friends will do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not detain the Committee for long—I have only one or two points to make. I must congratulate my right hon. Friend the Minister for bringing the proposal before us this week, which is just one week before the first official visit by the Israeli President to this country. He showed his support for our beliefs and values by volunteering to be a pilot in the Royal Air Force during the last war.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Human rights have been discussed. It is relatively easy to monitor human rights in Israel, which is one of the few countries in the middle east with a free press and a long-standing history of democracy. Some other middle eastern countries are not so fortunate. When discussing human rights in the middle east, we should remember that since the agreement with the Palestinian authorities the Israeli Government have released many prisoners. What did Israel get in return? Have we been told what happened to Ron Arad, who was captured in 1986 and whose wife, daughter, mother and brothers still do not know whether he is alive or dead? He was
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
captured and some of his letters have been received, but there has been an eerie silence for all too long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was in Israel in August I met the parents of Zachery Baumel, who was captured in 1982. All that they have received is part of his tag, which they carry with them every day. They do not know whether he is alive or dead. There are two sides to the question of human rights. The Israelis have made many concessions and released many prisoners, but they have received precious little in return.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It does not behove us to discuss east Jerusalem, which is the old, historic Jewish quarter. It was captured by the Jordanians, and while they controlled it they destroyed 57 synagogues. If one goes on a tour of east Jerusalem today, one sees the remainder of one of those synagogues. The Israelis were not allowed to go to the western wall. The majority of Israelis supported the deal over Hebron. We must face the fact that Israel stands for a united Jerusalem, which it believes should be the capital of the country. No one should deny them that right. If we say that east Jerusalem should be returned to the Jordanians or Palestinians, we shall be going down a cul-de-sac or into a tunnel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agreement is important; I know that several of my colleagues wish to speak so I shall restrict myself to those brief remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Menzies Campbell 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I declare an interest: I am the chairman of the Liberal Democrat middle east council, from which I receive certain financial assistance towards research. I have made arrangements for that to be entered in the next published Register of Members' Interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since 1991 the European Union has made new or expanded co-operation agreements, such as that which we are discussing, conditional on an undertaking by all parties to base their relations and their internal and external policies on respect for human rights and democratic principles. It would be surprising if the European Union had adopted any other policy. Those are important conditions and they must be universally applied and respected, not just by Israel but by Egypt and the Palestine Liberation Organisation, which the Minister described in his opening remarks as likely to be the subject of a similar agreement in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 2 of the agreement with which we are concerned stipulates that
	<br><blockquote><p>"respect for human rights and democratic principles constitutes an essential element"</p></blockquote>
of the agreement. The words "essential element" have a particular resonance in the present context. A breach of an essential element of an agreement is a material breach of the agreement itself. The Minister responded to an intervention by saying that there might be circumstances in which the agreement would be withdrawn, following such a breach. Could its withdrawal be achieved in the European Union by majority voting, or would it require unanimity? That is perhaps a technical point, but it might be of value to the Committee to know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without a clear signal that the conditions to which I have referred are more than a token gesture, there is little to suggest that the agreement would add
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0208">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
substantially to the continuing efforts of the European Union to promote human rights in the region. Failure by us to make clear the intention to enforce human rights conditions in the present case would seriously devalue this and all other agreements made by the European Union with other countries. That is why I support the view already expressed that the extent to which the agreement's conditions are implemented should be actively monitored. It is necessary to establish a clear intention to throw political weight behind the conditions. A monitoring mechanism, with a clearly defined mandate, seems to be the only effective way to ensure that the agreement is fully implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All members of the Committee are, I am sure, keen for relationships in the middle east to improve. The recent agreement in relation to Hebron is clearly welcome and the European Union must do all in its power to help to nurture and assist the fragile peace. I should like to acknowledge the most recent release of prisoners by the Israeli Government. The release of female prisoners was a courageous and constructive gesture, which should be acknowledged by those of us who will argue in this debate that Israel has an obligation to implement the human rights conditions of the agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As recently as December, the European Council declared its
	<br><blockquote><p>"support for the fundamental principles of a just and lasting settlement in the Middle East, notably land for peace and self-determination for the Palestinians, with all that this implies."</p></blockquote>
By making the will of Parliament clear on the issue, on this occasion, we shall not be imposing any new measures or additional burdens on the Israeli Government; we shall simply be attempting to underpin an existing agreement, and international obligations that have already been freely entered into.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All parties who were present at the 1995 Barcelona conference to which the Minister drew our attention undertook to respect human rights, democratic principles and the promotion of equitable regional economic co-operation and development based, inter alia, on the removal of barriers to the free circulation of goods. Yet the Israeli Government and judiciary have recently formally sanctioned higher levels of what is described as "physical pressure" against Palestinian detainees. Amnesty International has voiced serious concern over what it calls that "judicial authorisation of torture".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The use of force against the civilian population of southern Lebanon in order to apply pressure on Hezbollah amounts to a violation of protocol 1 of 1977, which is additional to the Geneva convention. The protocol is against
	<br><blockquote><p>"acts or threats of violence, the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population."</p></blockquote>
The confiscation of land and the expansion of illegal settlements are in violation of articles 42, 43 and 53 of the fourth Geneva convention. The Government and the European Union reaffirmed the illegality of those settlements most recently in the Luxembourg and Dublin declarations. Indeed, in the past month in an exchange on the Floor of the House during Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Question Time, the Minister
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
confirmed to me that it is still the view of Her Majesty's Government that Israeli actions on settlements are illegal in terms of international law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to closures. They violate the economic rights of those living in the occupied territories and jeopardise the establishment of a stable Palestinian economic base. Only if that base is achieved will political stability follow. The hon. Member for Leeds, Central (Mr. Fatchett) also came to that conclusion in his remarks. In a sense, our self-interest is at stake. Closures frustrate the considerable investment by this country, bilaterally and with the European Union, that was made to assist Palestinian economic development. The actions that I have described are unacceptable. The terms of the agreement are such that if those actions are persisted in, the agreement could, in the words of the Minister, be withdrawn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Progress towards peace can be maintained only with the confidence and support of the Palestinian people and of the people of Israel. By emphasising Israel's obligations under the agreement, we not only lend weight and credibility to this and other agreements but assist the delicate process of peace in the middle east. That is the contribution that the Committee can make to the critical task of confidence building. The agreement should be ratified, but it should be ratified only with the clear signals attached to it that I have drawn to the Committee's attention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Sir Mark Lennox-Boyd 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Morecambe and Lunesdale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to you, Mr. Lord, for calling me. It demonstrates that my contribution will be in order even though I am not a member of the Committee. I was in some confusion about that. Because I came to the Committee thinking that I would not be able to speak, I have not prepared extensively so I will—as everyone will be happy to learn—inevitably be rather brief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy to follow the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East (Mr. Campbell). I agree with everything that he said and with all the other reservations that have been expressed. I support the order for exactly the reasons given, but I have some reservations, to which I shall come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to approve the order because, as my right hon. Friend the Minister said, it will strengthen the trade relationship between the European Union and Israel and will afford opportunities for even more developed monitoring of the agreement. Breaches of the interim agreement have taken place, and we are likely to face breaches of this agreement. If a proper monitoring mechanism is developed on top of the existing one—I hope that my right hon. Friend will deal with this point later—it will afford an opportunity for the Council of Ministers to take action on trade matters by qualified majority voting. That is the best form of diplomatic pressure that can be brought to bear if the European Union thinks that action is appropriate. Such pressure may be achievable by the European Union because of qualified majority voting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two substantive matters in the agreement that affect the points about which I am concerned—the human rights clause and the trade clauses. Israel, of all
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0209">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
countries, has the most legitimate concerns about its own security. I hope that those who know Israel better than I do, and know the Palestinians less well than I do—I have known them for 30 years—will accept that when I say that as a friend of the Palestinians, I really mean it. I abhor all acts of violence and I earnestly support the Oslo accords in the hope that the peace that has so far eluded the middle east can be achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The balance that other hon. Members have mentioned must be struck because—apart from reasons of natural justice or good conduct—if the measures taken to maintain security are so strong that they seriously inhibit Palestinian economic activity, the very security that the Israelis seek will be dramatically and horrifyingly undermined. I believe that that has happened in recent years. The hon. Member for Leeds, Central (Mr. Fatchett) spoke of the appalling decline in the Palestinian economy in the past year. When I went to Jerusalem, Jericho and the west bank last year, for the first time in many years, I found that those places were definitely poorer than when I used to visit them 30 years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The febrile, fragile atmosphere of support for the agreement is not very sound. The Palestinian leadership is always mindful that it may be attacked by its supporters for being too accommodating of Israel's demands in negotiations. It is under pressure, which is why it is extremely important that the economy of the Palestinians should be built up and not put at risk in any way. It is certainly true that it has been undermined in the past year. We must build it up because the European Union is committing substantial aid support for precisely that purpose. It would be ironic if the EU were to commit aid support but not monitor the agreement, with which it is able to exercise clout to ensure that the economy is not undermined by oppressive retaliation or action by the Israelis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The movement of Palestinians, from Gaza to Jerusalem and to the west bank, and from the west bank to Jerusalem is fortress-like. That has the most serious implications for trade, and is a principal reason for the Palestinian economy suffering so badly in the past year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been alleged that the restriction has been imposed to teach a collective lesson: I assert that that is true. At whatever level the decision to give that message to the Palestinian people was taken, it is an element of collective punishment. All the restrictions suffered by those people since March 1996 have seriously undermined their economy. I despair that the Israeli Government, which has such intelligence in its community, does not see that a more accommodating relationship with the Palestinian people would help the peace process in Israel's own vital interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the question of the treatment of detainees. We have heard that the Israeli High Court has upheld the practice of violent shaking as a legitimate instrument of persuasion. If violent shaking does not hurt, I do not believe that anyone would be stupid enough to use it to try to obtain information from a detainee. If it does hurt, it is torture. I fail to see how one can argue otherwise. I confess that I have not read the Israeli High Court's judgment, but it causes me serious concern to know that it was the judgment of a
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
court in whose judicial integrity I have heretofore had great reason to believe and which has afforded respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Trade is one matter that has not been mentioned. There have been allegations, some of which must be true, all of which may not be, that many products made in the occupied territories have been classified by the Israeli authorities as being made in Israel. That is illegitimate and contrary to the agreement. The occupied territories are not part of Israel in international law as it is interpreted in the agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been other allegations that goods produced by Israeli-owned firms—they are owned by Israelis even though they employ Palestinians—get through miraculously quickly. There have also been allegations that, for some strange reason, the goods and, particularly, the agricultural produce of Palestinian-owned firms are more frequently delayed on their way out of Gaza. They are mostly foodstuffs and are therefore ruined, which further damages the economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the issues that should be monitored. I hope that my right hon. Friend the Minister and his colleagues will, in their representations to the European Union, seek to establish an even stronger monitoring mechanism. Since the conclusion of the original agreement, which we are now developing, an ambassador from the European Union has been appointed to monitor the Oslo accords. This is an ideal time to extend and formalise his responsibilities. I also hope that my right hon. Friend the Minister will press for an annual report on the monitoring mechanism to be submitted to the Commission and the European Parliament. The European Parliament could then debate the matter and we could seek an opportunity to do so in the United Kingdom. I support the agreement because we can institute such mechanisms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many Palestinians are currently disappointed and we must recognise how fragile the situation is. I end, however, on a note of optimism. With my affection for the Palestinians, I can say from the heart that I never cease to be amazed by the way in which, despite having passed from one disappointment to the next in recent years, they have come back with a resurgence of optimism. That is what is happening now. I had discussions with Palestinians yesterday and today and am in constant touch. I never cease to be impressed by the way in which their leadership and the educated among them adopt a positive attitude in discussions. For that reason and for the others that I have outlined, I hope that my right hon. Friend the Minister will make the strongest possible representations along the lines that I have described.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Mike Gapes 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ilford, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the problems with understanding Israeli politics is that the unexpected can and often does happen. When I last visited Israel in 1995, I had the impression that the processes that were under way would lead to an election in 1996 that would accelerate the peace process. I thought that matters would go relatively smoothly, but that has clearly not happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None the less, and despite everything that was said during the 1996 election campaign, the Government who were elected in 1996 have just signed an important
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0210">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
agreement on Hebron, which continues a process that was set in train by their predecessors. I agree with some of the criticisms that have been made—although many of those that the hon. Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale (Sir M. Lennox-Boyd) made were exaggerated. Given the circumstances that I have described, however, we can all look with some optimism on the processes that are under way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Parliament accepted the present agreement in 1996 and it was expected to come into force at the end of January 1997, subject to ratification by each member state. The agreement offers the possibility of contributing greatly to the continuation of positive economic and political development in the region as a whole. The agreement not only relates, as has been said, to economics and trade, but has political aspects. It is important that we do not start operating double standards towards Israel. Israel is a vibrant democracy; Governments get removed; leaders get thrown out of office; and the courts make decisions with which politicians, including members of the Government, do not always agree. That cannot be said about anywhere else in the region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are positive developments on the Palestinian side, but there are also serious worries about human rights. Some human rights activists in the Palestinian authority have said that their human rights conditions and ability to speak out are worse now than they were when they were under Israeli administration. That view is not held by everyone there, but there have certainly been some setbacks. Nobody is arguing that we should penalise the Palestinian authority on economic grounds because of human rights difficulties that have arisen there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are serious about economic development in the region, we should recognise that long-term economic co-operation—as envisaged in Barcelona and as envisaged by the former Prime Minister Mr. Peres when he talked about a new middle east—will not be assisted if we drag our feet about economic and trade cooperation between the European Union and Israel. Half of Israel's trade is with the European Union. Historically, Israel has a substantial deficit with European Union countries. It exports to the United States and imports many raw materials from the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Union is regarded with some suspicion in Israeli politics. That will in many ways be assuaged if we are seen to be playing much more the role of contributors to the economic development of Israel and the region as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was in Gaza and the west bank in 1995 and I have seen the conditions that have been described here. It is appalling to think of the educational level of the people in Gaza and the potential that they have for economic development and to see the conditions in which they live. Those conditions would be greatly assisted if the security situation improved to make possible the economic development that those people would benefit from within the region as a whole. We know that there is an enterprise zone between Israel and Gaza where there is potential for growth, employment and a whole
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
range of economic developments, but the difficulty is that, for understandable but regrettable reasons, the Israelis feel that their security must be their priority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As Europeans, we must make it clear that we will be prepared to contribute in whatever way we can to that continuing process, including the enhanced security of Israel and its neighbours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall conclude, because I am conscious that others may wish to speak, by emphasising the importance of standing against the extremists and rejectionists, wherever they come from. That includes making it clear in this country that we will have no truck with the supporters of Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah who are in this country, not simply those in the region who are causing so much difficulty. It also means sending clear signals to the Israeli people and the Israeli Government that we want the Oslo process and a comprehensive peace process in the middle east to continue, and we welcome the idea of developing economic, political and security co-operation throughout the region as envisaged by the Barcelona agreement 1995. The current Government, and, in a few months, the future Government will be able to make a positive contribution along those lines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Morley and Leeds, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief, because the majority of the issues have been covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one in the Committee wants to stop the ratification of the agreement. Its content must be kept to and, while that is not a matter of every jot and tittle, its fundamentals must not be flagrantly violated. The Committee has spoken wisely on the issues of human rights and democratic principles. I support, particularly, the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, Central, who stressed the progress which we expect in the peace process, and our wish to be sure that the Government maintain their position over the violation of human rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I trust that the Government will also maintain their position over the continuing Israeli occupation of south Lebanon, which article 76 of the agreement does not justify. What steps will the Government take to monitor the violations of fundamental principles and what mechanisms there will be to discontinue the agreement if those violations continue?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like other hon. Members, I am concerned about the closure of borders and the effect that that has on the economy in the west bank and Gaza and, indeed, on the position of east Jerusalem. I am sure that there have been few additions to staff this year, but I note and welcome the strengthening of the Foreign Office's consular office there. However, I am anxious that the Government maintain their stance on Jerusalem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to know the detail of the monitoring which takes place. Will the Minister expand on an written answer which I received from him yesterday concerning trade between the European Union and Israel? I was told that the association agreement
	<br><blockquote><p>"applies to the territory of the state of Israel"—</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0211">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
the hon. Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale alluded to that issue—and, therefore
	<br><blockquote><p>"it would not include the Occupied Territories."</p></blockquote>
It seems that the Government are clear about their view, but the answer continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The question of whether Israel would be in breach of the Agreement by certifying goods produced in the Occupied Territories as produced in Israel is a matter for the Commission."—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 18 February 1997; Vol. 290, c. 475.]</p></blockquote>
At least the Government have ventured a position. However, our view—the Commission is aware of it—is that the certification of goods produced in Israel would be in violation of the agreement. Will the Minister press our view on signatories to the agreement?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee do not intend there to be double standards. The agreement is not only with Israel, but with a number of other states in the middle east and the same conditions in terms of human rights and democratic principles should be enjoined on them. Can the Government do more than make the Commission aware that if the European Union connives at allowing that to proceed it will de facto legitimise illegal Israeli settlements?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I noted what the Minister said about settlements, an issue raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, Central. The present Israeli Government policy seems to be to continue the expansion of such settlements. In a sense, that was part of an election manifesto, but it is a clear violation of the fundamental principles of the agreement. I am anxious that the Minister should tell the Committee how the Government will monitor all those matters and what would happen if that monitoring were to show that Israel had made no progress with regard to respect for human life and the other fundamental principles of the agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Ernie Ross 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those hon. Members who have been in the House for some years would be surprised at the unanimity across the parties about the broad principles of this agreement. When we read the 
	<i>Hansard</i> record of our proceedings we will find little disagreement between us. There are always murmurs of approval or disapproval whenever an hon. Member speaks, but that is only to be expected, given the long history of antagonism between the two groups of people whom the agreement is intended to help—the Israelis and the Palestinians.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we will reach a successful conclusion. Like almost every other hon. Member in this Committee, I have spent most of my political life in the House trying to get the Israelis and the Palestinians round the negotiating table. When the Oslo agreement came into being, we were all amazed that those two seemingly implacable enemies were prepared to sit down, out of the glare of publicity, and try to find a way forward. It had always seemed clear that there could be a way forward if the two sides recognised each other's rights and were prepared to discuss them around the negotiating table, instead of exchanging missiles, bullets or insults.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite all the pessimism, matters have moved on since Oslo. No one believes that there is, for either side, an alternative to dialogue. Even in the worst moments—
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
of terrorist attacks on civilian populations or of outrageous acts by individuals against the Palestinian community—most people retained their belief that there would be peace eventually.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognised, too, that peace with the Palestinians would be the best security for Israel. The core of the middle east problem and the reason behind Israel's difficulty in establishing relations with its Arab neighbours was the denial of rights to the people called Palestinians. The best hope of peace in the area lay in the determination—shared by everyone, including the Israelis—to do something about the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an international agreement, and its clauses are meaningful. My hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, Central and the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East asked specific questions, as did the hon. Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale, who is not a member of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I begin with a specific matter, which the Palestinian Speaker raised with us yesterday. The Minister will know that there has been some dialogue over the meaning or intention of article 2. We need clarification on the record, although there will still be dubiety, given that lawyers are involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 2 refers to respect for human rights, not respect for human rights law. The European Union has correctly not sought to constrain the impact of the article to the terms of the body of instruments that are known collectively as international human rights law. The principle of respect for human rights cannot be separated from respect by states for the international instruments that were created to protect those human rights from abuses by states, which are not confined to those that make up international human rights law. The main purpose of international humanitarian law—particularly, in this case, the fourth Geneva convention—especially in the case of the Palestinians, is to protect the minimum human rights of a very vulnerable group of civilians who live under occupation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The protections against settlement, for example, are included because the type of conduct that creates hazards for the exercise of the fundamental human rights of a protected population is an eventuality that does not arise other than in situations of occupation—clearly there cannot be illegal settlements unless there is an occupation in the first place. If the Minister is clear, as are hon. Members on both sides of the House, that the settlements are illegal, it should be clear to everyone that this is a breach of international law. I hope that the Minister will talk about that when he replies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be wrong for us to give a routine ratification to the association agreement. I apologise to my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, Central for not being here when the other agreements were being discussed; the middle east is my area of interest. This agreement is important because a European Union-Israel interim agreement on trade and trade-related matters has been in effect since January 1996. However, there has been no EU response affecting the operation of that agreement, despite the many violations—witnessed by the Palestinians and others who are concerned about international law—in the way in which Israel is running the occupation of the west bank and Gaza.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0212">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
We need at least to exercise caution when we talk about the association agreement. If we give it a free run, it might be more difficult for the Minister and other European Ministers to impress on the new Israeli Government the need for continued talks. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, South (Mr. Gapes) that despite our fears following the election of Mr. Netanyahu, even he has been forced to accept that jaw-jaw is better than any other method of resolving disputes. I see from this morning's newspaper that he has got himself into trouble, which I shall come to shortly, but we send our best wishes to Mr. Netanyahu in his struggle against those who seek to undermine the peace process itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby referred to some of the organisations that have written to us about the agreement. It is right that they should do that, because those non-governmental organisations have been in the forefront of attempts to help the Palestinian community in the west bank and Gaza. It is right for us to obtain answers on their behalf.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yesterday the chairmen of the Middle East Council—the hon. Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale, the hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East and myself—met Abu Alla, the Speaker of the Palestinian Parliament. Although he was involved in the Oslo peace process, he is not dismayed, disappointed or downhearted; he is a rather feisty and determined individual. He shared one or two of his concerns with us and the Committee should hear about them this afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a general lack of awareness about what is happening in the west bank. We do not have audiovisual equipment here, but most people believe that there is a block of land called the west bank and that the Israelis have given it back to the Palestinians. Those who understand the situation realise that although the west bank includes some centres of the population over which the Palestinians have been given full control, other centres—such as Hebron—are shared with the Israelis in respect of security. Yet more than 70 per cent. of the area—area C—still has to be handed back to the Palestinians, which is the main concern of the peace talks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The burgeoning of Israeli settlement policy on the west bank—amounting to a de facto change—is a matter of serious anxiety. I hope that the Minister will make it clear that the Government will pay particular attention to area C. The Secretary of State referred to it in a previous Foreign Affairs Question Time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At Oslo, it was decided that the total area of the west bank to be left with the Israelis was only 10 per cent. At the moment, however, the Palestinians have even less than 10 per cent. at a stage when we are supposed to be halfway through the peace negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anxieties were also expressed about the new settlement proposed for the hill of Har Homa between Jerusalem and Bethlehem. Approximately 6,500 apartments will be built under the first phase of the project, but the overall plan is to expand the settlement to house 70,000 people. Mr. Netanyahu has not so far allowed that to proceed, but the mayor of Jerusalem has
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
threatened to send in his own bulldozers to start the demolition and construction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Union association agreement is likely to be passed by the Committee. However, the Minister should remind his opposite number in Israel that we are worried about the continuing determination of the Likud Government to expand settlements. Recently, a new page was turned in the internationally condemned campaign to expand Jewish settlements in the west bank and Gaza when a newspaper advertisement offered 120 houses for sale in 30 outposts—hardly the action of a Government who are trying to resolve an issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the previous Labour Government, those settlements and units—approximately 3,000—were frozen; yet the present Government have placed adverts in the press. If a plot of land in one not very pleasant part of Israel is offered for sale at a bargain price of £35,000, which would sell for £200,000 in another part of Israel, that amounts to quite a bribe. Many organisations are rightly worried about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Minister to be a little more firm about the Israeli Government's handling of east Jerusalem. The denial of residency to Palestinians can hardly bode well for the future. At present, 20,000 Palestinians who had rights to residency in Jerusalem have lost them through various means such as being forced to go abroad for education or being unable to build in Jerusalem and having to move outside. A further 60,000 Palestinians are under threat. Those residents need to know that the EU-Israel agreement that we are considering enables the European Union to press its partners, the Israelis, to stick to the Oslo accords and peace agreements and proceed as quickly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I expect the Minister to make it clear, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, South said, that the Palestine Liberation Organisation will be faced with exactly the same type of demands when that interim agreement comes before the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is true, Mr. Lord. I am sure that the Minister is absolutely bursting with information, and I will be brief so that he can give us all the information that he has been saving up throughout the sitting. I want to make a couple of points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the Committee has, rightly, concentrated on the question of rights. We have heard powerful speeches. My hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, Central—on whom the mantle of statesmanship already sits—emphasised the need for continuous invigilation of the rights record and for pressure to be brought through the agreement to upgrade that record. The hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East spoke about the importance of rights and of using pressure. I agree with the point made by the hon. Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale about employment and economic expansion
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0213">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
in Gaza. It is important that we use pressure to achieve economic expansion, which will, in the end, solve the problem. That emphasis has been correct. I agree with that point and there is no point in repeating it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to ask the Minister one question about imports from parts of the illegally occupied territories that do not qualify as Israeli, but where goods are being produced that are coming into this country and Europe as Israeli goods. That interests me because I have had problems with firms in my constituency importing prawns from Iceland, the Faroes and Norway. As with the goods from Israel, those prawns were certificated by the country of origin as having been produced in that country, but were subsequently found, on inquiry by Customs and Excise, to have come from Norway or the Soviet Union, not the certificated country. Those firms were fined substantially and deemed responsible for the imports. What happens in cases of firms in this country and Europe importing in good faith goods from Israel that are certificated as coming from areas of Israel that qualify for the trade agreement, but which actually come from other areas?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.47 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to respond to the debate and I welcome the close interest that the House takes in matters relating to the middle east peace process. That has been shown today by the high level of debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. Members detailed questions about the relationship between this agreement and the human rights situation in Israel and the occupied territories. I stress that by making human rights an essential element of the agreement and by establishing a more formalised political dialogue between the EU and Israel, the agreement will significantly enhance the effectiveness of EU action on this issue. The same will apply to the political dialogue with the PLO, which is set up under the agreement and with which we are progressing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Great Grimsby and for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross) referred to article 2 of the agreement. The question posed by Human Rights Watch was whether article 2 takes precedence over article 76 on state security. Although article 2 does not take precedence, measures taken under article 76 would need to be consistent with international law, including human rights. I agree with the comments about the importance of monitoring human rights in connection with the agreement and more generally. The EU has an efficient system, which, as I mentioned earlier, is carried out through EU heads of mission—in this case in Israel and the occupied territories—who send regular reports to the EU presidency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That includes a reporting process which is relevant to the association agreement. We shall continue to work within the EU to ensure that that monitoring is rigorous and prompt. Indeed, I can tell my hon. Friend the Member for Morcambe and Lunesdale that we are in discussion with out EU partners about how we can most efficiently monitor human rights in Israel and the occupied territories. The reports through EU heads of mission are valuable but ad hoc—there is no particular regularity about them. We will press for them to be produced regularly. If we refer specifically to the commitments set out in the EU-Israel agreement and the
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
EU-PLO interim agreement, we will be able to make progress and create the sort of system which will give my hon. Friend confidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Fife, North-East asked whether the Council of Ministers had to be unanimous to suspend an agreement on human rights grounds. I wrote to him on 31 January, stating:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This is a difficult area."</p></blockquote>
I think that the hon. and learned Gentleman will agree. In Foreign Office-speak, that usually means that we do not know the answer. However, in this case we know the answer. The advice of the Council's legal service is that the voting procedure for the suspension of the agreement is the same as that used to conclude it. In other words, it requires unanimity. However, if the proposal were to suspend only the trade elements of the agreement, we believe that the Commission might argue that that would fall under EC competence and that qualified majority voting would therefore apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A breach of human rights, however, would be material breach of the agreement. As human rights issues fall within the competence of member states, a decision to suspend or to withdraw from the agreement on such a ground would involve the member states deciding by unanimity. A fundamental breach would require unanimity, but I believe that the Commission would probably decide that something on the trade side would be decided by majority. That leads us—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fatchett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is that the Minister does not know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The answer is that suspending the whole agreement requires unanimity, but suspending the trade side or an item within it might well require a majority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I was saying, that leads us to the certification as Israeli of goods produced in settlements, which was discussed by my hon. Friend the member for Morecambe and Lunesdale, and by the member of the Committee with a portrait of himself on his tie, the hon. Member for Great Grimsby. Does that contravene article 83? That is a question of trade policy—it is not for the Council of Ministers—and certification is a matter of Community competence, not a United Kingdom decision. But in our view—I made this clear to the hon. Member for Morley and Leeds, South (Mr. Gunnell) in my written answer to him yesterday—article 83 makes it clear that the agreement applies to the territory of the state of Israel. The occupied territories are not part of Israel, so it follows that they should not, and would not, be included. However, we must put that view to our partners. We believe that majority voting, not unanimity, would apply to a decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Austin Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The picture on my tie is of Mick Jagger.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is that in such cases, when imported goods—prawns, for example—are certificated by the authorities of the country of origin as being theirs, the consequences fall on the importer if that is found not to be true. He is fined, is required to pay duty and must face various sanctions. What will happen in such cases when it is found that goods do not genuinely come from Israel?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0214">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In this agreement, we are looking for goods that come from Israel. Opposition Members asked whether, under the agreement, goods from the occupied territories would be regarded as goods from Israel. The hon. Gentleman's point about prawns is slightly different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be pleased to find out the liability for the importer arising out of goods that are not covered by the agreement and to write to the hon. Member for Great Grimsby with the information. I shall place the letter in the Library of both Houses, so that the hon. Gentleman, when eating prawns, will not feel liable to any surcharge levied by the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Leeds, Central raised the question of closures in the west bank and Gaza. In the spirit of the Committee, I wish to say that I admired the hon. Gentleman's speech. He and I have worked closely together on this matter, and it is clear that the House agrees that peace in the region is more likely if there is prosperity. Prosperity for Israel will lead to prosperity for Palestine, and a peaceful and prosperous Palestine will lead to a peaceful and prosperous middle east. I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's co-operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government understand Israel's pressing need for national security, but the Palestinians suffer a heavy economic penalty. As my hon. Friend the Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale and other hon. Members noted, the Palestinians feel that they suffer a collective punishment. We have pressed the Israeli Government hard on that matter. The United Kingdom was closely involved in drafting the Dublin declaration by European Union Foreign Ministers on 14 December, which urged Israel to relax all restrictions except those related to legitimate security interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A substantial and welcome easing of closures has resulted, but there is much further to go. A hearts and minds policy is perhaps the best option now: we must
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
try to ensure that people in the west bank get work and are able to maximise their economic potential. I believe that if people have something to lose, they do not want to lose it. The people of Gaza and the west bank want very much to build financial security for their families. That will enable them to live in close proximity to, and in peace with, their neighbours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that one hon. Member mentioned Syria. I believe that talks between Syria and Israel should be resumed on the basis of land for peace. We shall continue to work towards both those goals, and I welcome the interest shown in improving the Palestinian economy overall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government believe that all settlements in occupied territories are illegal under the fourth Geneva convention. They are an obstacle to peace, and that opinion is shared by our European Union partners and the rest of the international community. Building new settlements or expanding existing ones can pre-empt the final status talks and delay peace. Such settlements should not continue. Provocative statements or gestures by either side risk exacerbating violence. We raise that matter regularly with the Israeli Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the opportunity to air fully the issues arising out of this agreement, which will provide a solid foundation for strengthening the United Kingdom's—and the European Union's—ties with Israel. It will open up the region economically and allow important issues to be taken up in a formal political dialogue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
