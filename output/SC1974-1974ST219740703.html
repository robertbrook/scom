	<div class='legislation'>DRAFT HORTICULTURE (APPLE AND PEAR GROWERS) (SPECIAL PAYMENTS) SCHEME 1974</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>12 noon</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we start to consider the instrument, perhaps I might say we have, legally, an hour and a half in which to consider it, but we hope to finish by one o'clock. We can extend to a quarter past one, but if we do that we shall have to come back at some other time for another quarter of an hour. I hope that it is clear that we hope to finish by one o'clock or one fifteen, and if further time is needed the extra quarter of an hour will have to be at some other time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Norman Buchan)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the draft instrument.</p></blockquote>
May I say, Mrs. Butler, that the ways of the House remain strange to me despite the pasing of 10 years. We are here in a Committee to sit from 12 o'clock to half-past one. That we hope to finish by one we all agree, and we may go on to a quarter past one, but if we want more time we shall have to meet on another occasion. This is astonishing to me. It is even worse than some of the complexities that have been brought about in agriculture and horticulture partly as a result of our entry into the Common Market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Scheme, which is made under the Horticulture (Special Payments) Act 1974, does no more than replace the existing administrative arrangements. In other words, the payments that we are referring to here have been made under existing administrative arrangements which began on 1st August 1973 under the authority of the Appropriation Act. The special payments Act received the Royal Assent at the end of the last Parliament, but
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
we have delayed making the scheme until now so that we could have a discussion about the actual payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme takes account of the revised rates of grubbing payments which we have recently agreed with the National Farmers Union in the general discussions we have had on a general revision of standard costs in the industry. The effect of the revised rates is to increase the grubbing payment by about one-third. The scheme provides for the making of payments to commercial growers of apples and pears who decide to give up apple and pear production.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should draw the Committee's attention to paragraph 3(1). There are two forms of payment. In addition to the payment for grubbing and clearing the land, there is a payment for the discontinuance of the growing of eligible apples and pears. There is one payment on the work and a special payment which some people call a compensation, though it is not properly that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To be eligible a grower must show that he had on 1st July 1970 and at the date of application at least five acres of dessert and/or kitchen apples and/or pears, with the exception of cider apples and perry pears; that is to say, he was not just a recent grower but he had been growing apples and pears since 1st July 1970. The agricultural business must have been capable of yielding a sufficient livelihood at the time of the United Kingdom's entry into the EEC. A further proviso is that apple and pear growing must constitute at least one-third of the activity of the business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Growers applying under the scheme must agree to grub their entire acreage of at least one category, either dessert or kitchen apples or pears, and they must undertake not to replant with trees of any of the eligible categories for five years. Application for approval under the scheme must be made by 31st July 1976.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A point has been raised in earlier discussions on this subject about why apples and pears have been singled out for this treatment. In passing, I should say that this was not designed as an inducement for grubbing up. It was designed for those situations where the grower felt that he could not continue commercially. It was to ease his situation and get the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0503">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
land back into another kind of cultivation, rather than to act as an inducement to grubbing out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why apples and pears?—because they are different. They are unique in that before we adopted the CAP, we had a protective system based on import quotas. That has been replaced by a system of compensatory amounts which replaced the protective rôle of the import quotas. These act as import levies. The levies are not as restrictive as quotas. They do not have the same element of protection. Of course, they will also become less restrictive as they become reduced as we move through the transition period into full accession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The apple and pear growers in France and Italy have all kinds of climatic advantages, and it is clear, therefore, why we think that the opportunity to give up growing certain categories should be given to those British growers who have difficulties and doubts about their ability to compete.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The early estimates were that 20,000 acres might be grubbed up, at a cost of £4 million to £5 million. But applications have been few. The cost of approved proposals amounts so far to £200,000. I do not have the acreage, but I could find out if any hon. Member is keen to know about that. It would probably be about 1,000 acres.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Applications could increase as the protection against imports from other Common Market countries decreases during the transition period. Other growers of apples and pears may find themselves in difficulties, and we think it is right that they should be protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the passage of the Bill through Parliament, it was said that events may show that the legislation and this scheme would be little used, but it was right for the Conservative Government to introduce the Act and the original scheme. We think it was right to provide a safety net for growers, and we are right to continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.6 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas Torney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am anxious that there is no possibility that the European Economic Community, with its bureaucrats in Brussels, is responsible for the kind of economic or uneconomic conditions mentioned in the preamble to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
scheme and in the explanatory note, or is forcing our growers out of business for the sole purpose of ensuring that we sell to consumers in this country French and other apples instead of the excellent apples from the traditional apple growing areas of Britain. This worries me, as the whole of the common agricultural policy worries me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason, I should like the Minister to assure us that it is not some secret means whereby the EEC and its bureaucrats can open the door to wiping out such apple growing industry as we have in this country and so make it completely free. It is already becoming freer for the countries of the original Six, which are dumping their produce into our country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.8 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As, apparently, the only representative of Her Majesty's Opposition on this occasion, and coming from the Vale of Evesham, I feel I ought to add something to the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Minister says that he has had only a limited number of applications, has he any idea of what the final picture will be? This is important. I should have thought that the Government had begun to form in their own mind what the demands on public funds will be to the end of next year. That would touch on the question already asked, and we have to put out some feelers to see how serious this problem is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the concern expressed by the hon. Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Torney). If we look as though we are encouraging people to go out of business, while at the same time facing the kind of balance of payments problems that we have, this, although a marginal policy, is not a satisfactory situation, if that is seen by the industry to be the implication.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second, in that context, there are question marks over the future of the Apple and Pear Development Council. Although it is not completely germane to this matter, as the Minister's statement raises the whole future of the apple and pear industry, the sooner we have those question marks removed from the future of the council the better. I should be grateful for some indication of the future of that organisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0504">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>

	<p>12.12 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In response to my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Torney), I must say that it comes as poetry to my ears when I hear references to Brussels bureaucrats. However, it is not totally accurate in this case. It is not that we are trying to force out apple and pear growers at the behest of the EEC. Indeed, the scheme itself is not the direct result of an EEC ruling of any kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme arises because the quota system with which we used to protect the industry is now replaced by compensatory amounts. Indirectly, there is an influence on producers to leave the industry, but not through any direct forcing by the Market or by any direct ruling of the Market. Indeed there is the same kind of problem inside Europe. The amounts are not of a kind that would force an inducement upon growers to grub out. Nor are they designed to push out and reduce our own special kinds of apples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where there is a special kind of apple with which we can compete with Europe there is no problem. It is only where, because of climatic conditions and other factors, and producers growing the same kind of apples as are being grown elsewhere are not able to continue commercially, that we should make it easy for them to move out and allow the ground to be used in an alternative way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is by no means an encouragement or foreshadowing of any push, reduction or change in our existing advisory or any other structures in the industry. It is brought about to make the change easier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the questions posed are those that one asked oneself originally. It is a national scheme rather than an EEC scheme. One reason for it is that we could not continue with the import quotas, but that in itself is not a particularly satisfactory method of dealing with the matter if the land can be used in other ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that that covers the main points my hon. Friend raised, and almost by implication it covers some of the points made by the hon. Member for Worcestershire, South (Mr. Spicer), whom we welcome to our agriculture debates, representing the Opposition on this occasion. We have made clear that there is no
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
indication, suggestion or intention of letting down our apple and pear industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been having discussions with the industry on the future of the Apple and Pear Development Council. We received all the views, of those concerned in the industry only during the last few days. We recognise that a large number of people are concerned about it, and we shall try to give an answer on the future of this as soon as we can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want it to be thought that this scheme is in any sense presaging any slackening of our desire to assist our growers, and I do not think the growers would think of it in that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Spicer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the hon. Gentleman try to get an estimate of what might be the total amount of demand as a result of this scheme by the middle or end of next year?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know that I could do that. The last estimate was that to which I referred—20,000 acres at a cost of £4 million to £5 million. There is also the point that, as we move through the transitional period, the effect of the compensatory amounts will affect the situation when more may wish to go out. It is difficult to get the total effect at the end of the day, and even more difficult to get it in relation to any particular date. At present, between 1,000 and 1,500 acres have been approved for grubbing up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In one sense, it is heartening that so few applications have been received. It does not suggest that we shall receive an avalanche when the amounts change in the future. But I should be 10th to give an estimate. We cannot really deviate from our own estimates in the beginning of 20,000 acres at a cost of about £4 million; nor can we say that events have confirmed that. Circumstances might change as the element of protection lapses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we have so much time ahead of us, may I take the opportunity of thanking you, Mrs. Butler, for the quiet and competent way in which you have handled this very vexing question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
