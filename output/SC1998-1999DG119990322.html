	<p>
	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you as Chairman, Mr. Olner. I have never served on a Committee under your Chairmanship. I hope and trust that this will be the first of many such enjoyable occasions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft Social Security and Child Support (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999 provide for the new arrangements that will be introduced from the second half of this year. The draft Child Support (Miscellaneous Amendments) (No. 2) Regulations 1999 contain some consequential amendments to the child support regulations, all of which are derived from the powers provided by the Social Security Act 1998. The draft Child Support (Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 1999 make a small number of amendments to the secondary legislation, which provides the structure of the child support scheme. For the most part, they correct minor errors and clarify the intention of the legislation in cases of doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The changes in decision making and appeals fit in with the broader context of the Government's plan for overhauling the social security system. Principle 8 of the Government's Green Paper on welfare reform seeks to deliver welfare to people in a flexible, efficient and easy manner by seeking to deliver an integrated service across the country. The changes before the Committee will constitute one of the key early initiatives of the active modern service programme. Clearer processes, which are focused on the needs of the individual rather than on administrative convenience, should result. That approach will improve services and allow a more cost-effective and quick delivery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I shall address the changes to decision making and appeals, where change is long overdue. The current system of determining claims and resolving disputes is too long and complex. People have a right to expect their claims and applications to be dealt with correctly and in good time. When they wish to dispute
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
a decision, they expect to see it resolved swiftly wherever possible, or progressed rapidly to the appeal stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft regulations provide for an improved decision making and dispute resolution system, a simplified appeal system where five different types of tribunals are replaced with a single jurisdiction, and the introduction of a modern, accountable appeals service. To assist with the Committee's deliberations, I shall explain the content of the regulations in more detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will recall that one of the main provisions of the 1998 Act was that all initial benefit and child support decisions will be made by officers acting on behalf of the Secretary of State. That replaces the current system where there are a variety of different types of decision maker.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The current inflexible system of reviewing decisions often forces people into a frustrating and time-consuming appeals process. Clients often appeal against a decision, simply because they are not aware of any other way, in practice, to get their decision checked. The regulations overcome such problems by replacing the existing provisions for the review of benefit and child support decisions with a more efficient system for dealing with disputes and correcting wrong decisions at an early stage. Where decisions are clearly wrong, the agencies will put them right quickly with the minimum of fuss. The same straightforward and simple rules on how and when decisions can be changed will apply to all benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 3 allows decisions to be revised and replaced with new ones, for any reason, where a dispute or appeal is made within one month of the decision being notified. The regulation further provides that some decisions may be revised after the one-month time limit so that we can be sure that any errors are corrected effectively. Regulation 30 allows an appeal to lapse where someone appeals against a decision at the outset, and the decision is revised in his or her favour. There will, however, be fresh rights to dispute and appeal the revised decision which regulation 31 confers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even where errors are identified outside the one-month time limit, and the decision cannot be revised, a decision may be superseded under regulation 6. Superseding decisions, as regulation 7 details, will generally take effect from when the decision is made or when the application was made. Decisions can also be superseded under regulation 6 where there is a relevant change of circumstances since the original decision was made. In benefit cases, in accordance with regulation 7, a decision will be superseded from the date of change, provided the change is notified promptly, otherwise the new decision will take effect from the date of application. In child support cases, a superseding decision following a change of circumstances will take effect from the date of application.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In planning for the introduction of these new arrangements, the agencies have taken the opportunity to begin to improve their notifications. Our aim is that the notification of a decision should use language that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0121">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
is easy to understand and should explain the rules and decisions given. The notification will invite clients to contact the agency if they are not satisfied with the decision or if they have a query. They will be given the opportunity to discuss it and to present any new relevant information. The agency will then reconsider the case and either confirm the original decision or issue a new one. In either case, their right of appeal is protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now deal with the provisions on appeals. Current delays in the handling of appeals are unacceptable. Hon. Members will know only too well from their constituency postbags that across the country people wait, on average, seven months for their appeals to be heard. Many wait a year or more. That is unacceptable and the Government are committed to delivering significant improvements in performance. In developing provisions that will deliver the necessary improvements, I wish to acknowledge the vital help received from Judge Harris, the president of the independent tribunal service and his colleagues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations introduce a number of important changes to appeals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the regulations simplify the confusing jumble of time limits that currently operate—time limits that are difficult for appellants to understand. There are 28 days for this appeal, 42 days for that appeal, 3 months for that application, and so on. In addition, where appeals are lodged out of time, different rules govern their acceptance or rejection and the period during which such applications may be admitted. In short, the arrangements are a mess and we propose to replace them with a single one-month limit for each stage of the process. Various regulations—for example, regulation 3 for revisions and regulation 31 for tribunal appeals—achieve that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, regulation 36 ensures that tribunals have the necessary expertise to deal with the range of issues that may come before them. Social security and child support law can be complex and change rapidly, so all tribunals will include a lawyer. However, some appeals raise medical issues or questions of disability and others raise complex financial questions. Tailoring the composition of the tribunal to the issues raised by the appeal will ensure that tribunals are properly equipped to decide the relevant questions. A disability benefit appeal, for example, will be heard by a three-person tribunal, which will include a lawyer, a doctor and a disability expert, while a retirement pension appeal, raising questions of fact and law, would normally be heard by a lawyer sitting alone. That approach will allow the appeals service to concentrate expertise on the cases that need it and speed the service it offers to all appellants. For the most part, it is these regulations that will determine the composition of any particular tribunal. However, where the exercise of discretion is involved, I should like to make it clear that it will be the president or his judicial staff who will decide how a tribunal will be composed. While on the subject of tribunal composition, I should like to clarify the position on appeals relating to incapacity for work. All
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
such appeals will be heard by a lawyer and a doctor, and we are looking again at the wording of regulation 36 to ensure that that is made clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, 10 per cent, of appeals received by the independent tribunal service have no prospect of success. For example, child benefit is not payable for children over the age of 19, and an appeal in those circumstances simply cannot succeed because the law is explicit. The same is true in the case of the disability living allowance mobility component in relation to a child under the age of two. It is essential that we build in arrangements to ensure that such cases do not undermine the ability of the appeals service to handle other appeals speedily and effectively. However, there will be safeguards to ensure that appeals are handled properly. People will have the opportunity to argue in front of a tribunal that their appeal is not misconceived, if they wish to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, I want to make it clear to the Committee that the Government are expanding the role of tribunal clerks from that which we envisaged when the Bill was debated. We have done that after discussions with Judge Harris. Currently, tribunal chairmen must spend time dealing with clear-cut interlocutory matters, including the disposal of particular appeals. That time would be better spent on hearing appeals and helping to ensure that delays and backlogs are reduced. That will mean a speedier service for all appellants, so we have decided that clerks may handle matters involving a simple assessment of straightforward facts. Regulation 46 gives effect to that. It is, of course, essential that clerks can properly perform these duties, and Judge Harris has kindly agreed to assist with the training and guidance provided for clerks. Clerks will not strike out appeals in any other circumstances. I want especially to draw the Committee's attention to these changes because of their importance and because they are a change from our earlier proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the Child Support (Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 1999. As I said earlier, they make a small number of amendments to secondary legislation, which provides the structure of the child support scheme. For the most part, they correct minor errors and clarify the intention of the legislation in cases of doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members know that we are considering in depth all aspects of child support provision and of the Child Support Agency. We set out our proposals for change in the Green Paper "Children First: A New Approach to Child Support", which was published last July. We have consulted widely and in a few weeks' time we will publish our plans in a White Paper. However, the scale of change needed to bring about radical reform means that it cannot be done overnight. In the interim, we intend to make changes to pave the way for radical change and to make improvements between now and the introduction of the new scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This package of regulations marks a step in that direction. The difficulty that the Child Support Agency has had in obtaining maintenance from self-employed non-resident parents has been well documented. More than 80 per cent, of such parents do not pay their full
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0122">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
child support. Non-resident parents are reluctant to provide information on their earnings, partly because we treat their evidence differently from the Inland Revenue. Child Support Agency staff need special expertise to enable them to interpret the complicated information that such parents provide. We are doing something about that in the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 6 enables self-employed parents to provide the figures that they use for self assessment of their earnings for tax purposes for use in calculating maintenance. Only when they cannot provide them, such as when a new business is involved, will the agency have to continue to use the old, cumbersome arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 3 defers the reintroduction of fees until April 2001. Fees for the services provided by the Child Support Agency have been suspended since April 1995. That suspension was due to be lifted this April, but while the agency has made significant strides in improving its service to customers, it does not yet provide the quality and speed of service that we believe would make it right to levy a charge for that service. The Government have therefore decided to defer the reintroduction of the fees for another two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 6(7) restores the policy intention in respect of the valuation of property transferred before 1993 in lieu of child maintenance, where a decision by the child support commissioner has resulted in the value being less than was originally planned in the 1995 changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the most significant changes in the package. Hon. Members will be relieved to hear that I do not intend to burden them by going over the regulations one by one, especially as they are for the most part technical. I shall be happy, however, to answer questions about any of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The decision-making and appeals changes deliver the first element of the Government's objective of modernising welfare delivery. Nearly everyone in Britain is affected at one time or another by the service that we provide through our agencies. The regulations provide a strong foundation for the Government's Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill and future child support reform. They support a welfare state that is flexible, efficient, and easy for people to understand and use. I commend them to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Grantham and Stamford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to welcome you as Chairman of our proceedings, Mr. Olner. This is the first time that I have appeared under your chairmanship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Minister for setting out the Government's proposals. The Conservative party has no objection to the child support changes to which she referred, such as the revaluation of assets that are transferred as part of a couple's settlement. The same is true of fees; the Minister is right that the Child Support Agency is as far away as ever from achieving the standards of service and precision that would be
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
required to begin to justify charging the public fees. There is legitimate doubt about whether it provides acceptable value to the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our concern is with the Social Security and Child Support (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999; they form a large part of the regulations and fundamentally change the rules governing the appeals available to those who consider that the social security and welfare system has not treated them justly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After nearly two years of the new Labour Government, we are getting used to being pretty sceptical about Minister's statements and press handouts. They are always couched in the same bland and apparently entirely harmless language—the PR newspeak of new Labour. It is only when we being to look at the detail and the small, fine print that we realise that what appears at first sight a gain for the citizen or the cause of good government is in fact the exact reverse. So it is, I am afraid, with the bulk of the Minister's comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was, however, one thing about which the Minister was remarkably frank. She said that the Government's proposals in the Social Security and Child Support (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999 "fit in with" the Government's other welfare policies. That is all too true. The Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill is being considered in Committee. Among other pernicious aspects, it attempts to claw back more than £1 billion from vulnerable people— widows and the disabled. That is notwithstanding the fact that the presentation of the Bill made it appear to be good news for the vulnerable citizen. The reverse is the case. The regulations are indeed part of that agenda. The intention is to make appeals more difficult to load the dice further against the appellant who will, in many cases, be a vulnerable person. He may deserve a better deal from the social security system—he probably does—but he will be much less likely to get it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been not so much a harmonisation or unification of procedures in the different independent tribunals, but a move in every case to a structure that is more favourable to the Secretary of State and less favourable to the appellant. As the Minister mentioned, an appeal has to be made within different periods in different parts of the social security system; now, however, the period will be a maximum of one month in every case, subject to narrow restrictions. It is clear what is happening: we should be under no doubt that the intention is to make it less easy for individuals to appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the people affected are not especially sophisticated or professionally advised. How could we expect somebody who is living on social security to be professionally advised? That is a cruel idea. Some charities help and do excellent work. There are the various disability charities, the citizens advice bureaux and so forth, but they are under great burdens and often cannot respond as rapidly as might a lawyer who was paid £300 or £400 an hour to work on someone's behalf. It may, therefore, be extremely difficult to get the kind of help that is required and to formulate an appeal within a month.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0123">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

What is more, the regulations will make it more difficult to ensure that one's appeal has been formulated correctly. A draconian provision allows clerks to throw out appeals as misconceived if, for example, a required document is missing. All kinds of new mantraps have been set for the unwary, and most of the people who the Government are trying to clobber in this way are by definition unwary. They are vulnerable people rather than sophisticated or wealthy members of society who can more easily defend themselves. This is a cynical attempt to tighten the noose around them, and it is pretty unpleasant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a bad day's work for the interests of justice and good government. One of the virtues of having different appeals for different aspects of the social security system is that panels build up expertise—their members understand disability, pensions, child support or whatever area they are dealing with. It is unrealistic to expect that a more limited number of individuals sitting on panels that deal with a whole range of social security issues can keep up to speed so effectively with all the regulations and laws that are associated with different aspects of social security. Even more importantly, people will not have the experience of dealing with many claimants in a particular situation—for example, mothers or people with a specific disability. They will not see the same sort of case all the time and be able to develop a human understanding of the situations of such people. It is important that an appeals system in a humane country should be staffed by people who attempt to look beyond the mere facts and figures of the formal documentation or medical reports that are submitted to them to envisage how the individuals concerned can run their lives in society. That process will be eroded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Minister to explain further two aspects of the matter. First, regulation 21 is gobbledegook. I do not know whether you understood it when you read it, Mr. Olner, but I certainly did not. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1) For the purposes of section 25(3)(b) (prescribed cases and circumstances in which a decision may be made on a prescribed basis) a case which satisfies the condition in paragraph (2) is a prescribed case.

	<ol>

	<li>The condition is that the claimant would be entitled to the benefit to which the decision which falls to be made relates, even if the appeal in the other case referred to in section 25(1)(b) were decided in a way which is the most unfavourable to him.</li>

	<li>For the purposes of section 25(3)(b), the prescribed basis on which the Secretary of State may make the decision is as if—</li>

	<ol>

	<li>the appeal in the other case which is referred to in section 25(1)(b) had already been determined; and</li>

	<li>that appeal had been decided in a way which is the most unfavourable to the claimant."</li>
</ol></ol></p></blockquote>
I defy any normal human being to understand that. It would be very much in the public interest if the hon. Lady employed people who have the gift of writing clear English in formulating such regulations, especially given the pernicious agenda of which the new regulations are part. We are right to be suspicious of the meaning of this regulation until it has been thoroughly explained to us, and I would be grateful if she would do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
The second matter that we must explore in some detail requires, I fear, no explanation. Regulation 36 is a good example of new Labour speak. One can read it several times without realising that it provides for some appeal tribunals to consist of one person. An appeal tribunal consisting of one person is a contradiction in terms. It is not a tribunal, but an administrative decision made by an individual—a potentate established by the Government to try to prevent people from claiming social security benefits. Regulation 39 refers to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The chairman, or in the case of an appeal tribunal which has only one member",</p></blockquote>
a phrase which is repeated in several subsequent regulations. But it is quite disguised by the verbiage of regulation 36. We see, again, a nefarious purpose, which sets at naught the whole concept of a panel or tribunal. It is a mockery, disguised as it is under this unacceptable level of obscurity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that we have understood the sense of paragraph 36 all too well. It is one of the features that will lead Opposition Members to vote against the regulations. I still do not understand regulation 21, and I think that it is extremely important that the people who are likely to be targeted by it understand it. I should therefore be grateful for a clear explanation in simple English from the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find myself in the disconcerting position of agreeing almost entirely with what the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies) says. However, what is puzzling is that one notices in the child the likeness of the parent, in that the regulations spring from the Social Security Act 1998.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford has a great deal of respect for the right hon. Member for Camberwell and Peckham (Ms Harman) who was the previous Secretary of State for Social Security. But he probably does not believe that she spent the first 10 weeks after the general election drafting detailed legislation about social security appeals. As he will know, it was on her desk when she started her job. In other words, the right hon. Member for Hitchen and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley) drafted the legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman made an inadvertent slip in his logic—very uncharacteristically, if I may say so. He says, quite plausibly, that the right hon. Member for Camberwell and Peckham probably did not draft that particular piece of legislation herself in her first 10 weeks in office. It was drafted by her Department—her bureaucracy. That bureaucracy carried on from the previous Administration, to whom it never submitted these pernicious proposals. I am quite convinced that had these proposals been submitted to an Administration in which I had responsibility for social security matters, they would not have passed muster.

	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
Perhaps someone in the bureaucracy conceived some of these matters; perhaps Ministers conceived them. I think it most likely that Ministers seized on some of the worst, most autocratic and arbitrary proposals put forward by their own advisers because it fitted the Treasury agenda of reducing public expenditure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Webb</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Olner. I am trying to recall whether, when the Social Security Act 1998 from which the regulations spring came before the House in November 1997, Conservative Members supported it. I have a vague recollection that they did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We support these child support regulations. We welcome the attempt to track down self-employed absent parents and to use their income as declared to the Inland Revenue. As soon as parents with care say, "My ex is self-employed", one's heart sinks, because we all know how difficult it is to get money out of the self-employed. If these regulations help, we warmly support them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a number of concerns about the substantive social security regulations in front of us. Many were voiced by us alone when the Social Security Act 1998 was going through Parliament. I shall not detain the Committee at great length, but there are three areas that I want to touch on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first is the composition of the appeals tribunals. Many concerns have been voiced by welfare rights advisers who have been presented with the content of the new regulations and will have to implement them. I hope that a listening Government will take those concerns into account. On the composition of the appeals tribunals, the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford said that there can by one member. In the case of child support appeals, there is a feeling that there should be at least one person from each gender— one man and one woman—on the tribunal. The Child Poverty Action Group cites the example of a woman who has been subjected to domestic violence who might feel that leaving her child support arrangements in the sole care of a male on his own on a tribunal would not be to her advantage. Such males may be above reproach, but justice needs both to be done and to be seen to be done. One rather doubts that that would be the case in these circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore share the concern of the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford about one-member tribunals. Certainly in the case of child support appeals, I would want to see at least one member of each gender on tribunals. That would follow the model used in cases of disability, where there is someone who has experience of disability on the tribunal; likewise, in child support cases there should be someone from each gender.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second concern is time limits. If claimants are to have only one month in which to appeal against a decision, they will need sufficient information on the day on which they are notified that their benefit claim
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
has been turned down—they should not have to wait several weeks to obtain the full information. Moreover, as has just been said, the information that they do receive must be in plain English. Committee members will all have seen forms that use tick boxes— for example, applicants may be asked to tick the relevant box from a list including mobility allowance, disability and care component. It makes very little sense. Will the Minister assure us that when people are notified that they have been turned down for benefit, they will get a letter in plain English, as well as one citing all the relevant Acts and sub-clauses?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A month seems too short a period. The Child Poverty Action Group cites parts of the country where it can take six weeks to get an appointment with an experienced welfare rights adviser. In those circumstances, it is clearly unfair and unrealistic to suppose that people can respond in an informed manner within a month to the news that they will not get their money. The Minister might reply that there is a safeguard—that in "wholly exceptional" circumstances, the one-month period can be extended. But we are very concerned that the words "wholly exceptional" may be drawn very narrowly and that legitimate reasons for delay such as sickness might not be taken into account. Will the Minister assure us that the definition of "wholly exceptional" will be drawn as widely as possible and interpreted in a relaxed way?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A category of appeals for which the one-month limit might be deemed far too short is appeals to the social security commissioners. Such appeals are by definition limited in number, but they are very technical because they set a precedent and touch on a complex point of legal dispute. The idea that people should have only a month in which to decide whether to lodge such an appeal seems entirely inappropriate. Those are complex legal matters with which I suspect many hon. Members would struggle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third and final concern relates to striking out, an issue that we raised during the Committee stage of the Social Security Act 1998. I was more alarmed by what the Minister said today than I was by what was in the original Act. She said that clerks are to have even greater powers. I am sure that she will correct me if I am wrong, but as I understand it, clerks do not have to have legal qualifications and yet they will be able to look at a paper and say that the appeal is ill-conceived. In the Standing Committee examining what would become the 1998 Act we discussed a case which on the papers appeared completely ill-conceived. It was allowed to proceed because the striking out provisions were not law and the commissioners eventually found in the claimant's favour. However, any clerk looking at those papers would have thrown the case out immediately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may say that there is a right of appeal, but regulation 48 prescribes that such an appeal has to be made within 14 days of the notification that the appeal has been struck out by the clerk. It is not clear whether that is 14 days from the date of posting or 14 days from the date of receipt; given the post, that could be an important distinction. Will the Minister clarify whether that 14 days starts from the day that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0125">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
notification lands on the doormat or the day it is posted? That could take up a good third of the time available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that has to happen is that appellants have to be notified by the clerk that their appeal against having their benefit turned down has been thrown out. In response, they have to say whether they want to argue in person or have a preliminary oral hearing. I suspect that that is another hurdle being put in the way of people trying to appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully accept the Minister's point that the previous system needed streamlining—it contained anomalies and it was difficult to overturn obvious errors. We therefore welcome certain aspects of the reforms. However, the striking out provisions strike at the heart of justice. They allow an official to say, "You have no case"—not even a one-person tribunal in an oral hearing, where a claimant is present to make the argument, but just an official who will send a letter. Many benefit claimants may well receive that letter and understand it to mean that they have lost their appeal. That is most worrying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a number of reservations about the regulations which follow from our reservations about the Social Security Act 1998, which we alone opposed in Parliament, and unless the Minister can give us a satisfactory answer to those points, we will oppose the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Baldry 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Banbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a little hard to criticise officials or Ministers because the regulations are complex—they deal with complex matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A constituency like mine in middle England is not full of welfare rights advisers. If people have problems, they tend to come to me or go to citizens advice bureaux. I want to ask the Minister about promulgation. How can we ensure that necessarily complex regulations are translated into guidance notes for volunteers—who are often very professional—who work in citizens advice bureaux and for similar advice organisations on the regulations and other matters relating to the Child Support Agency? Unless we can be confident that people can obtain straightforward advice on the regulations, they will be put at a substantial disadvantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations are no more or less complex than any other part of the English law, but in other areas of English law, such as landlord and tenant law, people usually have access to legal aid. Solicitors have a vested interest in interpreting the law and ensuring that it is understood by their clients. That is not the case in this area of law, for which legal aid is not generally available. We are therefore dealing not only with vulnerable people but with people who are usually dependent on advice from volunteers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder what discussions the Minister has had with the Law Society about promulgating matters relating to the Child Support Agency. As a lawyer myself, I have been slightly concerned about what appears to be solicitors' lack of knowledge and understanding of the workings of the Child Support Agency. On occasion in my constituency, it has been clear that solicitors have
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
given people factually wrong advice about how the agency works. That requires that all these areas of public policy be promulgated in booklets, leaflets or guidance that can be understood by professional advisers, or experienced advisers such as those in CAB.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My last point is slightly different, and relates to assessment of the self-employed by the Child Support Agency. I echo what was said earlier. I am sure that every member of the Committee knows of similar cases from constituency surgeries in which parents with care have had considerable difficulty obtaining maintenance from absent parents who are self-employed. Of course, it is much easier in the case of a parent who is employed, because the Child Support Agency can invoke an attachment of earnings order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the agency was invented, absent parents who persistently refused to pay maintenance could be brought before either the magistrates court or the county court, where, in my experience—having done such work for about 15 years—if the court made it quite clear that if they did not comply with its order, penal sanctions would follow in due course, parents eventually settled down and started to pay. Sometimes it took more than one go, but eventually they entered a mind set in which they started to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem with the rules of the Child Support Agency in relation to parents who are self-employed, if I have understood them correctly, is that there is no point at which those parents are brought up short and it is explained to them that if they do not pay, a penal sanction will follow. It is not simply a question of assessing their income and earnings. Sooner or later, absent parents who are self-employed may refuse to co-operate with the Child Support Agency. There should be a mechanism to make them understand that if they do not co-operate there will be a penal sanction. There is no reason why mothers who bring up children on their own should be penalised financially because they happen to have been married to a father who was self-employed. That would be very harsh. If the CSA cannot ensure that such parents pay, it would be failing a group of parents with care and, more importantly, their children. The success or failure of such policies depends on how they are promulgated. Can people understand the proposals?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I disagree with the argument about striking out. If an appeal is totally frivolous or bound to fail, it clogs up the system, which means that those with valid appeals have to wait longer. We should not be squeamish in our attempts to ensure that the system is properly focused. The associated quid pro quo is that the state has to ensure that people understand how the system works.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall do my best to deal with the many questions that have been raised in this interesting debate. I apologise in advance if I do not deal with every point, but if I omit anything, Committee members can always leap up and ask their question again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0126">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
I shall describe the regulations' background. Despite the suspicions of the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford, they are a genuine attempt to do what the hon. Member for Banbury (Mr. Baldry) outlined, namely, to simplify the decision-making and appeals systems and to ensure that the lay person understands them. He or she should not be confronted by an edifice of different time limits, appeals dates and appeals systems for different benefits. We should try to make a coherent whole that people understand easily. That is one of the regulations' aims—they represent a genuine attempt to simplify and improve the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the passage of the Social Security Act 1998, Labour Members pointed out that the legislation would reduce unacceptable delays in the appeals process. As I said earlier, the average delay is seven months. I am glad that the hon. Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb) agrees about the need to reduce unacceptable delays, which mean that some people wait for more than a year before an appeal is dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To achieve our aim, we have to strike the right balance between the need to give people rights and other opportunities to appeal, and the need to speed along the process, which is in everyone's interests. The regulations strike the right balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The system involves various safeguards, which I shall describe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Webb</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I heartily welcome shortening the appeals process. However, people are upset not about the time that they are given to respond to officialdom but about the time that officialdom takes to deal with them. If people want to reply within a week, there should be nothing to prevent them from doing so. However, the regulations state that after a fortnight or a month, one cannot take appropriate action. If individuals need more time, why cannot they take it? Why is that prejudicial to their interests?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In all fairness, the delays can occur on both sides. We recognise that the Benefits Agency sometimes experiences delays in getting papers from its officers in the independent tribunal system. The existing tribunal system will shortly be replaced by an appeals agency, which will also be headed by a member of the judiciary. Ministers will be accountable but not responsible for it, and Parliament will have no direct responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We discussed the issues when we debated the 1998 Act. The regulations merely fill in the details of the principles that it outlined. I am loth to go over the issue again, but we should recognise that the delays are unacceptable. Some arise from administrative difficulties, which I hope that the new arrangements will put right. Others result from a delay in the request for a hearing or from a general inability to get extra information to the tribunal when it is asked for in a timely manner. There are delays all round. If we are to reduce the seven-month backlog, which we all agree is unacceptable, everyone must take responsibility for trying to speed up the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
The regulations encompass various improvements. Administrative changes establish the appeals agency, which has direct accountability to Parliament through its chief executive and the Secretary of State. Some judicial delays are tackled through the changes to the composition of tribunals, which will make it easier to hold hearings more efficiently at the right time for the right number of people. In addition, because of the time limits in the regulations, we are asking people who appeal to ensure that they get additional information or responses into the system quickly, within the one-month time limit which, in many instances, stretches to two months. I shall deal with that in detail later. Those changes should allow us to make faster progress and deal with the large backlog of cases. I hope to create a system that will give people who appeal a much faster response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other issue, which has not received much attention in the debate, is the chance to have a second look at the original decision. Appeals and their delays are often caused by the undergrowth that clogs up the appeals system. There are two types of undergrowth: one is the decisions that everyone knows from the start have gone wrong but which cannot be put right without going through the whole appeal system; the other is what hon. Members have identified as misconceived appeals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations put the onus on the agencies to deal with decisions that are wrong from the start. They give clients the chance to have a second look at a decision and to discuss it from the time when the benefit has been applied for and the decision has been made. That will allow them to check that it is in order and that no obvious mistakes have been made. There will be a dialogue about why the decision was made, who made it and under which rules. Clients will also be able to discuss the result. That will demystify the benefits system, which is an urgent task.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for misconceived appeals, we want to encourage a dialogue at the stage when matters can be put right quickly between the person who is making the decision and the person who is applying for the benefit. We are moving away from the assumption—one of the most incredible in the benefits system—that clients who, as the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford said, are often confused by the system and less able to cope with difficult bureaucracies, know a priori all their rights and benefit entitlements, and that it is their problem if they do not ask for them. We want to have a dialogue at the front end to clear up misunderstandings and create more trust between those making decisions and reporting them to clients and those who have applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All too often, I suspect—indeed, some research suggests—that people who receive notifications, hardly written in plain English, that they have a right to appeal, think that because the Benefits Agency, or the Child Support Agency, is telling them about a right to appeal, the agency must think that the decision is dodgy anyway, so they appeal it. We must have better dialogue at the beginning to try to resolve such matters at the outset. We should leave the system to deal only with those cases in which there is a genuine dispute,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0127">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
perhaps because of a genuine issue of discretion or different interpretation that can be properly tested in the appeal system. That is what the second look, which has not been commented on but which is a vital part of the changes, is designed to do. I hope that hon. Members will bear in mind that I hope that a positive dialogue will increasingly take place. The ideas of the hon. Member for Banbury about people being able to understand what they are entitled to—the other side of the coin of making the appeals system run properly— are provided for in the changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that deals with some of the issues that Opposition Members raised about notifications. We are working on changing all our notification systems and leaflets to explain things in the plainest English possible in a complex system. We are trying to get that balance right. For a while, there will be some information technology constraints on changing notifications, but the aim over time is constant improvement. I hope that that will deal with some of the misunderstandings that occur and can clog up the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new time limit will increase the period in which people can appeal a child support decision. People will have one month in which to dispute a decision, and a further month in which to make an appeal. They have not only the one month to which Opposition Members referred, but, in effect, two months. A time limit can be extended by 14 days when a person asks for a written statement of the reasons for a decision, or when the agency returns the appeal for signature or for further information. The one-month appeal time limit will, we hope, encourage people to exercise their rights promptly and ensure that their cases are resolved rapidly. It will also ensure that decisions are revisited while the facts are still fresh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another thing that clogs up the current system is that it takes so long to reach decisions that people's circumstances often change in the meantime, decisions must constantly be adjusted. That is one reason why we are attempting with the regulations to explain that the initial decision might be superseded by subsequent changes of circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Webb</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned that an extension of 14 days will be allowed when people ask for a written explanation of a Child Support Agency decision. My experience of the CSA is that, even when a Member of Parliament writes to the chief executive, a reply within 14 days is a miracle. Is she saying that a person who has a decision made against them by the CSA will receive a reply within 14 days? That would mean banner headlines in the tabloids if true.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that it is possible to legislate for that, but 14 days must mean 14 days, not someone's idea of 14 days: "We posted it 14 days ago; it only got to you a day ago—tough." The idea is that time limits should be there for all to see so that people who have to respond can do so quickly, not that they should merely be a way of striking out appeals. That is not the idea behind the changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford said that the intention of the regulations was to make it less easy to appeal. I absolutely reject that. If possible, we want appeals to have been resolved before they need to be appealed in the second-look process. We want to make the appeal system much faster so that appeals are dealt with much more effectively and people's entitlement to benefit is estabished accurately, quickly and to their satisfaction, in so far as that is ever possible. The idea is the exact opposite of what he feared.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to consider closely some of the issues that arise with respect to misconceived appeals. I agree with what the hon. Member for Banbury said. The appeals in question are defined very carefully in the regulations and we suspect that about 10 per cent, of appeals currently in the system fall into this category. The definition could hardly be more obvious. The regulation states that a misconceived appeal is
	<br><blockquote><p>"(a) frivolous or vexatious; or</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(b) obviously unsustainable and has no prospect of success".</p></blockquote>
Appeals that are initially so designated are heard by a legally qualified member of the tribunal. The hon. Member for Northavon should not mix up misconceived appeals with certain other appeals that clerks have the right to strike out. The two are separate. They will be considered by a legally qualified tribunal member who will be able to dismiss them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the role of tribunal clerks, which is in essence an extension of the role envisaged when the Social Security Act 1998 was debated, I want to explain the quite narrow circumstances which would apply. I agree with the comments of the hon. Member for Banbury, who had no objection, and whose experience as a lawyer, would, I expect, allow him to identify the circumstances in which clerks ought to strike an appeal out, without being too worried about the effects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is envisaged under the regulations that clerks would be able to agree, first, to withdrawal requests—which are fairly simple clerical decisions on whether someone has decided to withdraw an appeal. Currently that would have to be decided by a legally qualified member of the tribunal. Secondly, clerks could deal with postponement requests. If the clerk did not agree to the request, he or she would be required to ensure that both it and the note of refusal went before the tribunal at the hearing. Thirdly, the provisions would cover correcting accidental errors in tribunal decisions—slips of the pen when it was clear that a date had been mistakenly entered, for example. In the event of any doubts or objections, it would be possible to refer the matter to a legally qualified panel member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In certain limited circumstances, the regulations provide that clerks should be able to strike appeals out, first, on failure by the appellant to respond to a pre-hearing inquiry form within the required time limit; secondly, in the case of out of jurisdiction appeals, where no appeal lies against the decision as set out in schedule 2 of the regulations; thirdly, on the expiry of the absolute statutory time limit; fourthly, for want of prosecution, where, as the hon. Member for Banbury
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0128">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
would no doubt tell us, a person has ceased actively to pursue the appeal and there is therefore a decision to lapse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is that when that happens to an individual, clerks will not decide appeals or exercise discretion of any kind, but look at facts. Individuals can be assured of that. There is an option to refer to a legally qualified panel member if there is doubt about whether it is fact or discretion. If there are any doubts about the facts of an appeal, the clerk will refer to a legally qualified panel member. Guidance for clerks will be drawn up in conjunction with the president of the independent tribunal service. I understand that training for clerks is now taking place and that Judge Harris is helping to draw up a framework for us. The hon. Member for Northavon asked whether clerks had legal training. The answer is no, but they are being trained in the limited new duties that they will undertake in relation to the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is certainly some reassurance in the system being put in place, but are these plans for spot checks on the process to examine decisions taken by clerks in, say, a year's time, to see whether any would have been changed in different circumstances?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The entire system, from the agencies through to the tribunal system, will be subject to monitoring and appraisal, so the answer to the hon. Gentleman is yes. He might also like to know that both the Benefits Agency and the Child Support Agency have set up independent standards committees to monitor the effect of the administrative changes provided for in the regulations, and to provide information and advice to chief executives who, in following the regulations, will become personally accountable for their agencies' records in administering the system. The new appeals agency will carry out similar monitoring. I hope that we shall be able to see exactly what works in the regulations and what we shall need to change. I am confident that the systems will monitor developments in all areas, giving us information on what we need to known and on what, if anything, is going wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford had fun reading out, as one can, reading out regulation 21, claiming that it was impenetrable and asking what it meant. Read out of context in that way, I agree that it is difficult to understand because it is part of a large tranche of regulations. It is difficult to know what any legislative prose means if its is taken out of context. I shall attempt to enlighten him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 21 has to be read in conjunction with section 25 of the Social Security Act 1998, otherwise it makes no sense. We realised that when we heard the hon. Gentleman reading it. Section 25 relates to cases affected by an appeal in a similar case with similar facts and gives the Secretary of State a choice of actions to take in that instance. The first is not to make a decision
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
until the lead case is decided; the second is to make a partial decision on those aspects of entitlement that are not affected by the appeal in the lead case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 21 deals with the regulations if the Secretary of State decides upon the second scenario. It is difficult to go into greater detail about the meaning; it is just a way of dealing with cases similar to what is clearly a lead case in which law, or the interpretation of it, might be changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On some of the other issues that were raised, I agree with the hon. Member for Banbury about the difficulty of ensuring that self-employed non-resident parents undertake appropriately their responsibilities for supporting the parent with care who is looking after their children. We all know the difficulties of trying accurately to assess the income of the self-employed. It is not as easy as phoning up the employer and establishing the facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The change will allow, with agreement, the self-employed person to proffer his or her tax information given to Inland Revenue in the usual way as evidence of earnings for child support assessment purposes. That is currently not allowed, even though an individual might want it to be used to make an assessment. The current law is very prescriptive about how the self-employed should be assessed. I hope that that will assist the Child Support Agency in getting the maintenance assessments of self-employed people paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Banbury was right to point out the difficulties. I mentioned that 80 per cent, of the 36,500 people who are self-employed and under assessment by the CSA do not pay all that they should to their children. Clearly, any improvement will benefit the children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should remember that 1.8 million children are being brought up without any payment from the father. Many of them are living in modest circumstances with the parent with care and are supported by the state. We have to do what we can to improve their circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Member for Banbury will have a word with his Front-Bench colleagues about their response to clause 66 of the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill, which featured in the newspapers over the weekend. It will allow the Child Support Agency for the first time to go to the Inland Revenue and check on the income of self-employed people for these purposes, whether or not they agree. His colleagues' vehement opposition became clear this weekend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Banbury also asked about guidance. We want positive dialogue about people's entitlements and how best to go about claiming them. We want to explain decisions to them as well as explaining what they can do if they do not agree with them. We should attempt to see whether the second look can bring agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Banbury also asked whether the Law Society had been consulted. The answer is yes: we consulted, as we said we would in the Bill, an ad hoc group of welfare rights organisations. That involved the Law Society as well as other obvious groups. There were some differences, but several changes were
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0129">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
welcomed—for example, the handling of appeals at the second look stage and the much earlier issue of appeal submission papers to those supporting clients in their appeals. All those points were helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have dealt with the main issues in these complex regulations. I believe that they will enable us to start tackling the unacceptable backlogs and deal with the widespread confusion about people's rights to particular benefits. I hope that the system will quickly demonstrate that it is possible to reduce the backlogs and therefore to ensure that people get the benefits to which they are entitled much more quickly and efficiently. I commend the regulations to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No one could accuse the hon. Lady of being perfunctory in the way in which she answered our questions. Her presentation was extensive, but, at times, a little muddled. For example, she said that it was inevitable, when one is trying to simplify matters, particularly when one is trying to speed up the hearing of appeals, that a balance had to be struck and that some people would therefore lose out. However, a moment later, she said that the changes were in everybody's interests. She cannot have it both ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady also said that the fact that the different times now available for appeals to various tribunals would be harmonised would greatly benefit the lay person. If she means by lay people those who might find themselves having to make an appeal, they will not mind the different periods of appeal or the different procedures for making appeals in different parts of the social security systems. Few citizens will make simultaneous appeals on all the various aspects of social security. People are concerned only with their own cases. They may have to come back only once or twice more during their lives, perhaps for a Child Support Agency or disability appeal. They are concerned only to get a fair hearing. It is no simplification for them that the appeal times for other appeals happen to be the same as for theirs. I dare say that it is convenient for the Government, but that does not make it convenient for the lay person. The hon. Lady seems not to have thought through her argument completely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady said that it was the Government's objective to demystify social security. I think that all hon. Members would agree that that is a fine objective. However, she did not succeed in demystifying regulation 21. She explained that the regulation arose only in the second case provided for in section 25 of the Social Security Act 1998, when the Secretary of State decides to determine an appeal even though another outstanding appeal is related to it. She did not explain what happens then—and we still do not know. She probably does not know. I hope that she will think about it. I am afraid that, in the manner of new Labour, and despite her charming manner, she will say, "Well, we had an enormous majority without any
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
trouble; we can now forget about it." No one will do anything about it. In that respect, she is, sadly, all too right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A serious practical point arises. I am not trying to score a rhetorical point, but to comment on the interesting suggestion made by my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury. If regulations have to be couched in impenetrable language—I do not accept that necessity for one moment—it seems highly desirable that we should adopt the solution that is used for Bills. The Government should produce an explanatory memorandum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It goes to the heart of what my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury suggested that those advising appellants, welfare advisers and those working for charities for people who depend on benefit, and the individuals themselves, should have access to a simplified explanation of the regulations. That principle should be extended beyond the appeal system that we are discussing this afternoon. If the Government take seriously our shared objective of demystifying the social security system, I hope that they will give some thought to that possibility. However, it would require some Department of Social Security officials setting aside time to try to turn some of this into plain English.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that such a plain English explanatory memorandum should be justiciable—that an appellant could refer to it before an appeal, and say, "I have a translation here of something that is completely incomprehensible. The translation is clear: will you decide the appeal on the basis of the translation?" That would require some skill. It opens the question of why, if that can be done, the original cannot be written in plainer language. We are moving into a wider field when talking about the simplification of legislation, but I draw attention to a piece of legislation that the Minister found as difficult to understand as Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that there is not much that we can do, Mr. Olner, other than express our dissent with the appeals regulations by voting against them. However, for the reasons that I set out earlier, we shall not oppose the other two sets of regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
