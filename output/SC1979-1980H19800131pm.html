	<i>Question proposed</i> [

	<p>4.30 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Albert Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With what I hope is an uncharacteristic lack of sense of timing, I failed to complete my initial submission on this morning. However, I was very close to doing so, so I hope I can wrap it up quickly now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main issues which I think we need to cover concerning clause stand part are, first, the extension of the normal or maximum period for the granting of the road service licence from three to five years. What is the justification for that, given that there is currently a great deal of flexibility and potential for change in passenger transport?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second, our passenger transport legislation has never—so far as I know—defined the special reasons which enable the commissioners to issue road service licences for periods shorter than the maximum period prescribed, which is three years under existing legislation and five years under the Bill. Will the Parliamentary Secretary say what those reasons are, given that there is a change in the criteria by which the traffic commissioners operate?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that it is ill-judged to take away, by this legislation, the traffic commissioners' right to issue a six-month road service licence. If anything, the proposed legislation strengthens the case for a short-term licence. It would give the commissioner the opportunity to see how a new user of the road service licence in the area performs, before confirming it as a long-term licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the main issues. While I am on my feet I shall raise a question which, admittedly, goes wider than the clause? I
	<span class='label label-info column'>910</span>
explain the reason briefly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In pursuing our duty of discussing the Bill, we have to refer to the 1960 Act for the interpretation clause, since the Bill, if carried, will become part of the 1960 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is correct, Mr. English. Part I of the Bill will become part of the 1960 Act. Therefore, it would be subject to the interpretation clause affecting part III of the 1960 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1960 Act is somewhat unusual. Parts other than part III, have separate interpretation clauses. Part III is covered by a general interpretation provision in section 257. That has been amended by subsequent legislation, and I think it would be to the convenience of the Committee if we could be referred to a fully up-to-date version of that clause. If the Minister can provide us with a copy that will help us on this and subsequent clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport 
	<div class='member'>(Mr. Kenneth Clarke)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall see what can be done before the next sitting to guide the Committee towards the most convenient place in which the 1960 Act, as amended, can be found. It has been amended over the years with the result that if one obtains an original printer's copy—which I have seen Labour Members using—one may be reading a passage that has been amended in the intervening time. There are texts that give statutes as amended. One can never be sure that they are entirely up to date, but I shall do my best to make sure that the Committee is directed to an updated version.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is entirely concerned with the duration of road service licences, once granted. It makes only one important change. It alters the duration of the ordinary licence in the ordinary course of events from three to five years. One of the purposes of the Bill is to reduce the sheer burden of unnecessary work before the commissioners, and the time-wasting bureaucracy and cost of repeated applications of one kind or another, where no real public interest is served. Therefore, there is no justification for keeping the limit at three years. It would be a general relaxation to increase it to five years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We contemplated the possibility of granting road service licences without any time limit. No doubt some Labour
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0499">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>911</span>
Members would support that move. There is an arguable case for it, but if there were no means of requiring an operator to renew a licence, it would tend to underline the present pattern of services and give an advantage to existing licence holders. Where their licences conferred on them the monopoly of services, it would make it more difficult for that monopoly to be challenged or reconsidered if they never had to re-apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill changes the law to some extent, so the arguments are not as strong as they would have been under former legislation. Under that legislation, once an operator had his licence, he was in a very strong position 
	<i>vis-à-vis</i> competitors. Among the precedents and practices that the traffic commissioners have developed over the years, is the so-called principle of priority. It means that the traffic commissioners usually decide that, other things being equal, the existing operator should have priority over any other applicants. Under this Bill the presumption is that the commissioners should grant a licence to a newcomer who asks for it, unless they are satisfied that it would be against the public interest. The arguments about reinforcing monopoly are not as strong as they were.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, it seems to us that to take away the time limit would put the licences beyond review. It may inhibit others questioning the quality of the service or considering variations in the service. Therefore, the five-year period should be retained. The result of the change from three to five years will be that well established operators, with a licence, will be troubled less often with the process of having to apply to the commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not every road service licence need be issued for five years. The right hon. Gentleman went on to question the special reasons that will give the traffic commissioners the power to award road service licences for shorter periods in certain circumstances. That may sometimes be the operator's wish. Let us take, for example, excursions. We are putting excursions and tours on the ordinary road service licence basis, but the operators will not want to pay the fee for a five-year licence for one excursion. He will want one of a much more limited duration. However, the commissioners may, for special reasons, limit a road service licence for stage carriage. Those are the issues that trouble the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-
	<span class='label label-info column'>912</span>
Furness (Mr. Booth).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He asked me to give examples of the sort of circumstances in which commissioners might limit the period for which the licence lasted. One might be that of a new town, an expanding town or an area of great urban development. A licence might properly be awarded for services to a newly-developed housing estate, but when in two or three years' time that estate had spread it might be quite unsuitable for the pattern of services to be retained. The commissioners might, therefore, feel that there were special reasons for restricting a road service licence to that area for, perhaps, two years only and then inviting reapplications to alter services to meet whatever pattern of development had emerged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A second illustration would be experimental services of various sorts. The commissioners might feel that it was valid to give a novel idea a strictly experimental and limited period in which to operate, to judge its progress and effect on the network and to hear the views of those with representations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another example would be when an operator had to establish his reliability. The commissioners would want to be satisfied about a newly-established operator's reliability, efficiency and ability to comply with the conditions of service, and so on. If there were a slight question mark over an untried operator, that would be another special reason for giving him a road service licence, limited in the first place perhaps, to 12 months or two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those examples give rise to other points put by the right hon. Gentleman. He asked why, in respect of experimental services, we were not re-enacting provisions in section 139 of the 1960 Act—which was put into that Act by the 1978 Act—for the grant of six-month licences, to enable a service to be evaluated. We are repealing that provision by schedule 9.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That 1978 innovation was designed to encourage experimental services, and the main feature of the procedure was that such a service could be given a six-month licence without the need for public sittings. In practice, very limited use has been made of them. It was a somewhat half hearted reform of the system and we believe that it is overtaken by the reforms in the Bill as a whole which make it much easier to get road service licences. That is yet another procedure for obtaining a road service licence which is now an unnecessary
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0500">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>913</span>
alternative, given that we have done so much to facilitate new licences in the remainder of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would still be perfectly reasonable in certain circumstances to grant a short licence without the need for public sittings and the expense and inconvenience that that involves. One of the innovations that we are bringing in is contained in paragraph (9) of schedule 5. We are removing the requirement for public sittings before traffic commissioners, so they would have discretion about that in appropriate cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If all those provisions are taken together with clause 11, there is no reason why the commissioners should not grant a licence for six months to a suitable experimental service without there being a public sitting using their powers in schedule 5. If a service were introduced which exactly met the requirements of the 1978 Act and which was suitable for that procedure, the traffic commissioners would be able to handle the matter in exactly the same way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Gentleman says "in exactly the same way", does he mean that the commissioners could deal with it without a public sitting, or do his remarks encompass the period of time? Could a six-month licence still be granted? Is a minimum period not prescribed in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.45 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it there will still be six-month licences. Five years is a maximum. The traffic commissioners can—
	<br><blockquote><p>"for special reasons determine that it shall continue in force only up to and including an earlier date".</p></blockquote>
It has to be one of the specified dates. I shall not go into that complication. But I believe that so long as the specified date requirement were complied with, it would be possible to restrict the licence to six months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman raised another matter, which arose again on one of my examples. That was whether an operator has to prove his reliability and so on. I do not wish to go back over the ground whereby someone without an operator's licence can apply for a road service licence. The reason for allowing that is to enable someone to apply for a new service before he has entered into the necessary capital investment. That may be quite extensive.
	<span class='label label-info column'>914</span>
Clearly it would be a great deterrent to someone wishing to extend services if he had to invest in a new depot, new buses and so on and obtain an operator's licence for all that capital investment before he were even allowed to make an application to the traffic commissioners. The outcome may be uncertain. He may not get the road service licence. It is rather like obtaining outline planning permission before one has bought land. That is possible under existing planning legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An approach may be made to the traffic commissioners for a road service licence. But if the application is successful the resulting licence will have no effect until an operator's licence is obtained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman talked about someone with a road service licence in John o'Groats obtaining an operator's licence in Land's End. That is conceivable, though not on that scale. It is conceivable that the application for an operator's licence will be made to a different commissioner from the one who granted the road service licence. It is important to realise that the safety requirements will be no different. Exactly the same tests of good repute and so on will be required. I do not think that it could seriously be argued that anyone would go to one particular traffic commissioner because standards would be lower there. The only reason for going to a different traffic commissioner would be because the basis of operations, the existing buses and so on, were in another commissioner's area. When deciding which traffic commissioner to go to for an operator's licence, for the convenience of all involved the obvious choice is the traffic commissioner within whose territory the mechanics of the operation are stationed, and it could arise that a road service licence would be obtained before an operator's licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The operator with the road service licence can, of course, use another operator's vehicles and staff to run his service. Again, there is nothing wrong with that so long as there is an operator's licence. The holder of that licence has to comply with all the safety requirements envisaged in the Bill. That is not too far removed from the present situation. At present someone with a road service licence can hire his vehicles, so long as they are public service vehicles, from another operator. He can hire a vehicle with a driver and staff. Difficulties could only arise if the responsibilities for complying with the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0501">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>915</span>
operator's conditions on the one hand and with the road service conditions on the other became confused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I say, the holder of a road service licence can hire a vehicle and driver from another operator. The operator of the service has the responsibility for complying with the conditions of his road service licence. The operator of the vehicles has the responsibility for complying with the conditions of the operator's licence and the other vehicle requirements. But so far as the public and the traffic commissioners are concerned, the obligation to comply with the road service licence requirements and conditions rests with the holder of that licence, the man who went and got it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order to avoid incurring the penalties that we discussed earlier he must ensure by whatever means he can that the conditions are complied with, and the operator of the vehicles, the man who is hiring out his vehicles and drivers, has to comply with all the conditions of his operator's licence. The safety of the vehicle and so on is therefore guaranteed in that way. In practice, the important thing is that there would be no danger of some cowboy slipping in, using somebody else's road service licence and avoiding the conditions of that licence or in any way reducing the safety of his vehicles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not absolutely clear about one point which may be of some importance. Is the Parliamentary Secretary saying that someone who does not have an operator's licence, but who has successfully applied for a road service licence, may come to some contractual arrangement with a person who has an operator's licence in order to run the service? Or is he saying that before the successful applicant for the road service licence can make any arrangements with such an operator to run the service he must himself have an operator's licence, although not necessarily one that he would use to work in that road service licence area? It is a narrow point, but it is important to the argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to that is provided by clause 4(4) which provides that
	<br><blockquote><p>"A road service licence granted by the traffic commissioners for any traffic area shall be of no effect at any time at which the holder does not also hold a PSV operator's licence".</p></blockquote>
Therefore, whilst a person who applies for
	<span class='label label-info column'>916</span>
a road service licence need not hold an operator's licence at the time he applies, he cannot start a service unless he himself holds an operator's licence. It is possible—I am now going down the avenues that the right hon. Gentleman regards as dangerous, although they are unlikely—that he could then obtain an operator's licence for passenger service operations in another part of the country, and so long as he held an operator's licence for his bus services there he could then bring his road service licence into operation. But he could only do that, of course, by hiring vehicles and men from sonebody else. If he used somebody else's vehicles and men, what I have just quoted applies. They have to be provided by somebody who himself also holds an operator's licence. That person will then have the primary responsibility for the obligations under his own operator's licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have covered most of the problems that trouble the right hon. Gentleman. I do not think that they add up to any reason for rejecting the notion that there should be some limit to the duration of road service licences. As I have said, we toyed with the idea of having no time limit at all, but for the reasons that I have given on balance, we rejected it. I think that it would be unnecessary in the new circumstances to continue to restrict it to three years. I hope that the Committee will agree that the clause should stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary. He has clarified the position considerably. I am not convinced that it is necessarily logical or desirable to have this complication of arrangements, but at least we are clear about the responsibility of the applicant for the licence. He has the responsibility to ensure that he has an operator's licence before the road service licence can come into effect, even though he may contract with somebody else who has an operator's licence to use that licence in effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That gives rise to an additional complexity or difficulty in relation to the bringing of an action for breach of the licence. If a breach of the conditions is brought about by the operator and no action lies against him, presumably one has to go against the holder of the licence if the arrangement is made in that way. That is an unfortunate, and I should have thought, unnecessary complication. But I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0502">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>917</span>
pursue the point no further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of the period of the licence, one can see that the temptation for the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary, in their desire to get rid of all controls—one understands the way in which certain Conservatives flock behind the banner of "Away with controls" until they see the effect of that on services in their areas—possibly even led them to think that a road service licence, like a driving licence, might be obtained for life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This throws up a very interesting issue that we raised previously but to which we have still had no answer. How far will commissioners be issuing road service licences in which the route is laid down as a provision rather than a condition of the licence? In other words, is it the case, as I understand it, that on some road service licences it will be possible to apply for a variation of the route covered by the licence whereas on others it will not?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is my understanding of the matter if I have read the Bill correctly. On some, if one wished to change the route at all, one would have to apply for a new road service licence. Yet on others there would be the possibility of variation. I may have this the wrong way round, but I think that it turns on whether the route is a provision or a condition of the licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That seems to me to bear heavily on what the Parliamentary Secretary has said. He said that it would be in the public interest to have licences checked at periodic intervals so that they may be challenged. But surely that argument applies to variations as well. I should like the Minister to confirm that my reading of the Bill is correct, that a licence could be issued and that someone could ask for a variation of the route. But in some cases the applicant would have to apply for a new licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the repeal of the six-month provision is unfortunate. I accept the public sittings argument, but I disagree with the Parliamentary Secretary's judgement. If a new applicant, who was not an operator in the area, applied for a road service licence, it might justify a public sitting, even if it resulted in a six-month licence. But I accept that that is a difference of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stand lost in admiration at the Parliamentary Secretary's faith in the private entrepreneurial spirit in the public transport industry. If he thinks that a lot of people are now queueing up to make
	<span class='label label-info column'>918</span>
massive investments in new bus services and that they need only be assured that they will obtain a road service licence before they plunge into buying new buses, uniforms and establishing new depots, I hope that he is right. Although I am normally an idealist and an optimist, I cannot see much evidence to justify his view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal first with the narrow point that the right hon. Gentleman raised. The route for which a road service licence is issued can either be a term of the licence or a condition attached to it. If it is a term, the operator needs to apply for a new road service licence when changes are contemplated. If it is a condition of the licence, the operator would apply for a variation. It is more likely that, if it were a term of the route, it would not contain much detail, whereas conditions of routes would tend to be specific. The licence might indicate the main centres of population to be served by the road service licence. They would be part of the terms. It could give the starting town, the intermediate town and the finishing town. Then in the conditions it would give the detailed route, naming the streets to be travelled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards our faith in private operators, both sides of the Committee—as is always the case in politics—are in danger of overstating their cases. I do not believe that there is a vast number of entrepreneurs about to rush in and invest millions of pounds in road transport. But I believe that there is scope for a steady improvement and change—change is necessary for improvement in this area—in the pattern of road services. I believe that many of those who operate coaches may be tempted to go into alternative forms of service and try their hands at more excursions, express services, and even a bit of stage carriage on the side. The more successful will expand their businesses, and the unsuccessful will, we hope, improve their businesses in response to competition. But the climate will change in such a way that it will be possible for the entrepreneur and for the efficient to improve the service to the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That ought not to be inconceivable to anybody. But is almost inconceivable to the Opposition, who are so defeatist that they expect road transport to continue to decline, have assumed that it will and simply want to protect the vested interests
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0503">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>919</span>
of those who happen to be in that industry at the moment. Idealist they may be on some things, but they are certainly not idealist on this matter. I ask them to be a little more imaginative and to contemplate that it may be possible to get rid of 50 years of unnecessary bureaucracy and control and produce some worthwhile improvements in the climate as a result. Clause 11 is an essential small part of that
	<span class='label label-info column'>920</span>
process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
