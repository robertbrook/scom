	<div class='title'>Draft Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income) (China) Order 1996</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Michael Jack)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income) (China) Order 1996.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to consider the draft Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income) (Denmark) Order 1996; the draft Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income) (Finland) Order 1996; the draft Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income) (Latvia) Order 1996; and the draft Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income) (Republic of Korea) Order 1996.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to introduce the five orders to the Committee. The first two orders, in respect of Korea and China, bring our treaties with two rapidly growing economies up to date. The next two, in respect of Denmark and Finland, modernise our treaties with two important Scandinavian trading partners. A new, comprehensive treaty with Latvia is a welcome addition to our treaty coverage in the Baltic states. The orders all take as their starting point the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development model as it has developed over the years. All that helps to sustain the United Kingdom's position as a world leader in double tax agreements, with our network of approximately 100 bilateral tax treaties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Double taxation agreements are welcomed by the business community, because they reduce tax-related barriers to international trade and investment, and provide certainty of treatment. They achieve that by reducing withholding tax on investment flows; preventing double taxation by allocating taxing rights; and providing a mechanism with which tax authorities can resolve difficult cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I shall consider Korea. Korea now has the 11th largest economy in the world and has recently been accepted as a member of OECD. We very much look forward to participating with its representatives in that forum. Our existing double taxation treaty with Korea dates back to 1977 and clearly needs revision to reflect the changes in policy and the developing economic relationship between the two countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, there are several important changes in the new treaty, including the rates of withholding tax on dividends, interest and royalties and a date for bringing to an end the provisions under which the United Kingdom gives relief for benefits obtained under tax incentive legislation in Korea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
I am confident that the new treaty will promote greater trade and investment between the two countries. At present, more than half of all Korean investment in western Europe comes to the United Kingdom. Our exports to Korea are growing faster than those from virtually any other EU country. The conclusion of the treaty marks another important step in our increasingly close bilateral relationship with Korea, which has been developed so successfully since my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister's meetings with the Korean President in 1995 and in March this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The protocol with China amends the double taxation agreement that was signed in 1984. That agreement has operated well, but requires updating to take account of changes to China's tax incentive legislation. In line with our current policy, a time limit has been included for relief to be given for those incentives in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
China has experienced a rapid rate of growth in recent years and British business rightly regards it as an important market. My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister led a large delegation of British business leaders to China early this summer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions of the protocol will be of particular benefit to United Kingdom companies seeking contracts for large infrastructure projects and will enable trade and investment between the United Kingdom and China to continue to expand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United Kingdom has close relations with Denmark. It is our 17th largest export market and we are its fourth largest supplier, with about 6.7 per cent. of the market. Exports and imports are roughly in balance, worth about £2 billion a year in each direction. British construction companies are prominent in several large infrastructure projects, which will increase Denmark's importance as a gateway to other markets in Scandinavia and the Baltic states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right, therefore, that the provisions of the double taxation convention between the United Kingdom and Denmark are kept under review to ensure its smooth operation. The convention was signed in 1980 and was the subject of one other protocol in 1991. Subsequent changes in policy and specifically indentifiable problems in pensions, royalties and shipping have necessitated our bringing into action the new protocol before the Committee today, to continue to ensure the smooth operation of the convention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Relations between the United Kingdom and Finland are generally excellent and in particular we enjoy close trading relations, where the general trend is upward in both directions. Finland is the United Kingdom's 19th largest export market. The United Kingdom is Finland's second largest overseas market. The United Kingdom's visible exports to Finland in 1995 amounted to £1.7 billion, an increase of approximately 30 per cent. United Kingdom visible imports from Finland have traditionally outstripped exports, principally because of the large quantities of paper products that Finland supplies. The double taxation convention between our two countries was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0125">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
signed in 1969 and has been the subject of four protocols. Changes to the Finnish taxation system and to both countries' policy on the granting of tax credits to foreign residents are the prime reason for the negotiation of the protocol that is before the Committee. The existing convention, as amended, has operated well, and, subject to the Committee's agreement, the new protocol will ensure that it continues to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Latvia is the latest Baltic state with which we have negotiated a new double taxation convention in place of the old United Kingdom-USSR treaty. Since Latvia attained independence, relations between our two countries have again become close. The United Kingdom is helping Latvia to consolidate its independence, build up democratic institutions and undertake economic reform. Latvia has benefited from many projects under the United Kingdom's technical assistance programme and know-how fund. Trade with Latvia is relatively small, but increasing. For example, Cable and Wireless have bid successfully with Telecom Finland for a contract worth $160 million over two years to refurbish Latvia's telecommunications system. That is by far the largest British investment in the Baltic states, and the largest single foreign investment in Latvia. With that trade background in mind, I hope that the Committee will agree to the five orders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.36 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Dawn Primarolo 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The treaties before us—the two new agreements with Korea and Latvia, and the three protocols revising existing treaties with Denmark, Finland and China—are welcome. However, I should like to ask the Minister a couple of questions about variations between the treaties and either original provisions or the recommended OECD treaty provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 5(4) of the Korean treaty relates to operations deemed not to be a "permanent establishment". The old treaty and the OECD model exclude from the term "permanent establishment" maintenance of stock of goods not only for purposes of storage or display but for purposes of delivery. That word has been deleted from article 5(4)(b) and paragraph (5)(b) makes it clear that an agent who maintains a stock of goods for delivery may constitute a permanent establishment. Will the Minister explain the reason for that departure from the normal OECD base provisions followed in most United Kingdom treaties? Generally the United Kingdom would not regard the mere delivery of goods as constituting the taxable exercise of trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 23(4) of the Korean treaty deals with the definition of Korean tax. It provides that the definition of Korean tax payable should be deemed to include amounts that would have been payable under Korean tax law, but for an exemption or reduction of tax granted. Will the Minister comment on the United Kingdom's present policy with regard to granting matching tax credit for tax spared? Generally it has been understood that such relief is granted to weak economies. As the Minister pointed out in his
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
introduction, the Korean double taxation treaty is a recognition of the growth in the Korean economy, which he said was now the 11th largest economy in the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister explain the reason for the provision in article V of the Chinese protocol, which inserts a new article 23(4) into the treaty? Under these provisions, the United Kingdom undertakes to grant matching credit relief in respect of Chinese tax spared under the various provisions of the Chinese domestic code. The normal United Kingdom treaty tax-sparing provision does not grant relief for periods of more than 10 years from the date on which the foreign exemption was first granted. Paragraph 4(b) extends that period to 13 years in respect of various infrastructure projects and grants to competent authorities and it adds the right to extend the time limit by mutual agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The explanatory note suggests that these amendments.
	<br><blockquote><p>"reflect the revision of Chinese domestic legislation in relation to the taxation of foreign invesment".</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister expand on that and explain why it was necessary to grant our Chinese treaty partners relief beyond the period commonly included in United Kingdom treaties?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jacques Arnold 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gravesham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Lady tell the Committee whether she thinks that the provisions to which she has just referred should apply to Tibet?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I should like to know why they apply to China. When I have an explanation of why they are needed in that treaty, I may be able to deal with the hon. Gentlemen's question. We are not discussing Tibet. Although I would be happy to do so, I am sure that you, Mr. Anderson, would bring me back to order if I did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to ask about the entitlement to tax credits in the Danish and Finnish protocols. The main point of both protocols is that the United Kingdom is withdrawing entitlement to tax credits previously allowed to residents of Finland and Denmark receiving dividends from United Kingdom companies. That reflects the fact that Finland and Denmark no longer grant tax credits in respect of dividends paid by their own companies. Will the Minister explain the Government's present policy in relation to the grant of tax credits under treaties in respect of dividends paid to non-United Kingdom resident shareholders?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In articles IV and V of the Danish treaty, paragraphs (6), (7) and (8) of existing article 11 and paragraphs (5), (6) and (7) of existing article 12 on royalties have been deleted in favour of a new provision. All the provisions deal with avoidance. The articles deleted were introduced recently by the amending of the protocol of 1 July 1991, which, in effect, refused relief under the treaty to Danish companies that were controlled by other companies in third countries. Will the Minister explain why it has been necessary to redraft the articles, as their current drafting seems to be a little less draconian in its effect? I am sure that such a move will be welcomed by many,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0126">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
but will the Minister explain why it is necessary and why the negotiations led to a backing away from a much harder line?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 4(3) of the Latvian treaty relates to dual-resident companies and it provides that, where a company is resident in both jurisdictions, the competent authorities shall endeavour to settle the question of residence by mutual agreement. This is an uncommon provision in itself. The usual rule is to allot residence to the country in which the company has its place of effective management. The last sentence, however, is unique as far as we know in that it refers to settlement by mutual agreement. It is provided that in the absence of agreement between the competent authorities, the taxpayer shall not be entitled to claim any relief or exemption from tax provided by the convention. That seems a strange rule. Although companies are often resident under more than one jurisdiction, having made the arrangement for the purpose of tax avoidance, it can equally happen that companies trading in two jurisdictions can quite innocently find themselves considered as residents of both countries. The suggestion that unless the competent authorities can reach agreement about the country in which companies are resident, the taxpayer will be denied relief, seems somewhat harsh, especially as there is no provision in the treaty to enable disputes between the competent authorities to be resolved. Will the Minister explain the reasons for that provision and how disputes are to be resolved?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 5(6) contains the usual wording whereby an enterprise does not have a permanent establishment because it carries on its business through a broker, general commission agent or other agents of independent status. The final sentence, which is common in United Kingdom treaties, states that such an agent may constitute a permanent establishment if his activities are devoted wholly or almost wholly to that enterprise. However, in the exchange of notes, it is stated in article 5(6) that
	<br><blockquote><p>"where the transactions between the agent and the enterprise are made under the conditions which would be made between unrelated persons the second sentence of paragraph (6) shall not apply".</p></blockquote>
Could the Minister explain that provision? The question is not really how much an agent is paid, but whether the trade of the overseas company is being carried on through the medium of an agent. It is not relevant to consider whether the agent is paid too much or too little for his services. Some explanation of that unusual clause would be appreciated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, on article 24 about the limitation of relief, sub-paragraph (2) refuses relief from tax in the other country where avoidance arrangements have been made to take advantage of domestic law concerning incentive to promote foreign investment. The exchange of notes adds:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is understood that incentives to promote foreign investment shall not include incentives promoting only domestic investments."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
All of that presumably has something to do with Latvian law as opposed to the set OECD treaty requirements. It is not usual in our treaties and it is not clear what relief is granted by the United Kingdom in cases where taxpayers have not suffered tax because of Latvian incentive legislation. Will the Minister explain what that relates to and, in particular, how, under the terms of the treaty, it is possible to distinguish between Latvian laws directed at promoting foreign investment and those promoting domestic investment?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful for the explanations that the Minister has given on the treaties and I hope that he will be able to clear up those minor points of variation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.48 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for Bristol, South (Ms Primarolo) for her kind words of welcome for the five double taxation treaties. They will send out a clear message to those who read our proceedings that the House favours such helpful developments in our trading relations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the hon. Lady for the clarity with which she expressed her concerns, but before I answer her seven specific questions, I want to respond to my hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham (Mr. Arnold) who asked the hon. Lady about Tibet. If my hon. Friend has read article 3 of the agreement, which he has probably looked at, he will have noted that China is defined by reference to its territory in which the laws relating to Chinese tax are in force. As a keen China watcher, he will know that there is political debate in China at the moment on whether the Chinese tax regime applies to Tibet. I hope that that puts beyond doubt the situation concerning Tibet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady asked some specific questions and I shall do my best to answer them. If she then requires further clarification, I shall be happy to write to her with further details. Her first question related to article 5(4)(a) and (b) in the new Korean treaty, which refers to permanent establishment. She asked why the deletions had been made and compared it with the current OECD model.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph (4) makes some exceptions to the rule that a country may tax profits which a business makes from a fixed place of business which it has in that country. The extent of the exceptions is a matter for negotiation and these paragraphs follow closely the terms of the OECD model convention. But, specifically, Korea wished not to include in the list of exceptions the case of a foreign company which uses premises in Korea to maintain a stock of goods from which it fills orders for sales to Korean customers. In this day and age of electronic business, that will have wider and more general application in future discussions, but that is the reason for the provision.

The hon. Lady's second question related to article 23(4) of the convention with Korea and she rightly focused on the treatment of that convention on matching credits. Matching credits were first granted in the United Kingdom convention during the 1960s and the purpose was to prevent the frustration of tax incentives given by developing countries to promote economic development. The United Kingdom's policy
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0127">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
is to renegotiate existing treaties to remove those provisions which give matching credits to tax spared when those provisions have served their original purpose. Korea is clearly such a case, but to meet the expectations of existing investors who have taken advantage of tax sparing in Korea, matching credit will come to a close in 2003. Provisions giving matching credit in new treaties will be included only in carefully selected cases and subject to strict time limits, provided that the overall balance of the treaty is satisfactory.

The hon. Lady then asked probing questions on China which led to the intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham and I hope that we dealt with that point. Following the theme of matching credits, but in the context of the China agreement, the hon. Lady asked why a period of 13 years was used in new article 23(4) instead of the previous 10 years. She was right to focus on that because article 4(b) indicates the current period of 10 years. A 13-year period has been accepted for profits from infrastructure projects, agriculture, forestry and animal husbandry projects and projects in remote, underdeveloped areas. In those specific cases, China considered that it would be unable to attract foreign investment without longer-term incentives. In a spirit of co-operation, the United Kingdom was willing to recognise Chinese concerns in the context of achieving an overall and satisfactory settlement.

The hon. Lady then turned to matters nearer home relating to the treaty with Denmark.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Cohen 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leyton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recall some bitter arguments between the United States and China on patents in the past year. Is the Minister satisfied that China has moved forward and now respects international patents?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr Jack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a matter of international concern. Patents—the securing of intellectual or other rights—are not covered by double taxation agreements, which deal with the after-events when patent matters have been sorted out, trade has commenced, investors have invested, income has been earned and profits have flowed. Tax then becomes a relevant issue and that is the subject of the orders. But if he wishes, I can alert one of my right hon. or hon. Friends in the Foreign Office to provide him with further information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady asked about agreements initially with Denmark and Finland and combined credits on dividends and tax credits with those subjects. It is important to address first article III of the Denmark treaty and article IV of the Finland treaty—the dividend articles in the two protocols which relate to the giving of tax credits on 6 April in the year following that in which the protocols come into force. Subject to the wishes of the Committee, we anticipate that this will be 6 April 1997 for Denmark and 6 April 1998 for Finland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady's next question related to tax credits and United Kingdom dividends. Again, there is some history here: tax credits were first given in UK conventions in the 1970s when the profits of UK companies were subject to corporation tax at a rate of
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
52 per cent. Now that the rate has fallen to 43 per cent. payment of tax credits to non-resident investors effectively reduces the burden of corporation tax on profits still further: for this reason it is no longer considered that it should be given to residents of the other countries concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the hon. Lady's questions on articles XI and XII of the Denmark treaties, she commented on the fact that these had been replaced by articles III and IV of the new protocol, although the existing provisions were introduced only in 1991. The new provisions follow the same pattern as the anti-avoidance provisions included in other new conventions recently concluded by the UK. Both the UK and Denmark were dissatisfied with the existing provisions, hence the new provisions, which are seen as preferable because they are more tightly focused in instances where there is intent to take improper advantage of the conventions. I doubt whether anyone regarded those provisions as a barrier to genuine commercial activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady's remaining questions were about matters related to items relating to Latvia. She asked about a "place of effective management" and commented that, compared with the OECD model, the provisions of the new treaty seemed to be an uncommon practice. I do not wish to get too deep into uncommon practice, so I shall focus my comments specifically on article 4(3), from which the question stemmed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The concept of a "place of effective management" is not used in Latvian law; Latvia was reluctant to adopt the terms of the OECD model. Nevertheless, business can take encouragement from the exchange of notes accompanying the convention; the notes indicate that the place of effective management will be taken into account in considering the application by the competent authorities of article 4(3) of the treaty. The Inland Revenue's experience is that the mutual agreement procedure generally affords a satisfactory solution to problems of double taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady asked about article 5(6) and again referred to the exchange of notes on the article. Latvia was worried that the usual OECD provisions of paragraph (6) would provide an opportunity for companies which traded in Latvia through an agent to avoid tax. The UK agreed to recognise Latvia's concern, but the exchange of notes is intended to ensure that a country may impose tax only as a consequence of the final sentence of paragraph (6) where relations between the agent and his principal are not on an arm's length basis. An additional protection precludes the unexpected imposition of tax on a principal where his agent has formerly acted independently for a number of principals but loses his other clients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the hon. Lady asked the question about article 24(2) in the Latvian agreement and the clarification in the exchange of notes. A provision in these terms has been included in several treaties with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0128">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
former Soviet Union states. The intention is to prevent a loss of United Kingdom tax on the income of third country residents through the interaction of the convention and the wide-ranging tax incentives which have been offered to foreign investors by countries whose economies are in transition. The provision precludes a claim to benefits under the convention where a resident of a third country receives income from the United Kingdom through a Latvian company which is exempt from Latvian tax on that income as a result of incentives to attract investment. The provision will not apply where exemptions from Latvian tax relate only to Latvian income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the hon. Lady for the clarity of her questions. I hope that she finds my answers satisfactory, but I stand ready to deal with any further points in correspondence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
