with the intention of inducing another person to believe that he or another person acting as a gangmaster in contravention of section 6 is acting under the authority of a licence.</li>

	<li>A person guilty of an offence under subsection (1) or (2) is liable on summary conviction—
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2003-2004C004P0I0044">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<li>a document was improperly obtained if false information was provided, in or in connection with the application for its issue or an application for its modification, to the person who issued it or (as the case may be) to a person entitled to modify it,</li></ol>
and references to the making of a false document include references to the modification of a document so that it becomes false.</li>

	<li>In this section "relevant document" means —</li>

	<ol>

	<li>A person commits an offence if—</li>

	<ol>

	<li>he enters into arrangements under which a person ("the gangmaster") supplies him with workers or services, and</li>

	<li>the gangmaster in supplying the workers or services contravenes section 6 (prohibition of unlicensed activities).</li></ol>

	<li>In proceedings against a person for an offence under subsection (1) it is a defence for him to prove that he—</li>

	<ol>

	<li>took all reasonable steps to satisfy himself that the gangmaster was acting under the authority of a valid licence, and</li>

	<li>did not know, and had no reasonable grounds for suspecting that the gangmaster was not the holder of a valid licence.</li></ol>

	<li>The Secretary of State may by regulations make provision as to what constitutes "reasonable steps" for the purposes of subsection (2)(a).</li>
