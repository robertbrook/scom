	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department for Education and Employment (Mr. Eric Forth)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Draft Jobseeker's Allowance (Amendment) Regulations 1996.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the draft Jobseeker's Allowance and Income Support (General) (Amendment) Regulations 1996 and the draft Social Security (Adjudication) Amendment Regulations 1996.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I, at the outset, say how sorry I am—I am sure that other members of the Committee join me—that the hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) is unable to be with us today. I understand that he is indisposed, and I send him our best wishes for a speedy recovery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will recall that the main set of Jobseeker's allowance regulations was debated and approved by the House in January 1996. In that debate and during the passage through the House of the Jobseekers Act 1995, hon. Members were able fully to consider the many facets of the jobseeker's allowance and what would make it different from, and superior to, the help currently given to unemployed people. With the implementation of JSA in October this year, we shall be making jobs—and the pursuit and winning of jobs—the focus of all our efforts on behalf of unemployed people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the principal set of regulations was laid before the House, we made it clear that the Government might need to come back to the House with further regulations, including amendments to the main JSA regulations, before JSA was implemented. We constantly review the structure of all social security benefits, to ensure that they remain as consistent and equitable as possible—that they reflect the Government's policy intentions and provide the taxpayer with the best value for money. As part of that process, several changes have been made to income support since the JSA regulations were introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An essential feature of the design of income-based JSA is that it should be aligned with income support when appropriate. Those changes in income support now need to be reflected in JSA, to ensure that the provisions will also operate in JSA when it implemented in October.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
We also recognised in January that some corrections might need to be made to what an extensive and complex body of regulations. I remember some fascinating exchanges with the hon. Member for Makerfield over the definition of N and our promise to amend it at the earliest opportunity. Further detailed scrutiny of the regulations has thrown up a number of similar points of detail that we aim to set right in these amending regulations. Furthermore, the work of the central adjudication services in preparing the guidance of the chief adjudication officer on JSA has brought to light some ambiguities in the regulations. We take this opportunity to clarify the main regulations, to ensure that there is no confusion over interpretation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of the amendments made by these regulations are minor and I will not seek to describe in detail all the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Patten 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Oxford, West and Abingdon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Shame.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Sedentary interventions are to be deprecated on all occasions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: So not to the Committee's patience, it will be convenient to highlight a few of the significant elements of the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During our recent debate on the Government's project work pilot regulations, the hon. Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Bradley) asked why we had not provided in the JSA regulations for risks to health and safety to be cited as "good cause" for leaving an employment programme or training scheme. I hope that he will be pleased to see regulation 6 of the first set of amending regulations, which reflects what my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security confirmed during that debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 10 introduces new provisions in the jobseeker's allowance regulations covering persons from abroad and asylum seekers. Those provisions mirror changes in income support introduced after the principal JSA regulations had been agreed. The Government believe that, as a general rule, the taxpayer should not be called upon to provide a benefit income for people from abroad. The regulation will ensure that only those people who claim asylum on their arrival in the United Kingdom and who have permission to work will be supported by the public purse while they look for work. The Committee may recall that the equivalent income support regulations have already been the subject of a full debate in the House and in another place. The provisions do no more than bring JSA into line with income support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 11, is required because of changes in income support. The rules governing the treatment of capital belonging to claimants in residential care, nursing homes of certain other types of residential accommodation were recently changed so that those
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0539">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
claimants will be allowed £16,000 of capital before they lose their entitlement to benefit, and up to £10,000 will be wholly disregarded when calculating the benefit to which they are entitled. The number of people in JSA who fall into that category may be small, but we are anxious to ensure that they benefit from the same improvements as those on income support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Jobseeker's Allowance and Income Support (General) (Amendment) Regulations that were laid on 30 April are concerned mainly with clarification and with keeping JSA aligned with income support. Regulations 3, 4 and 6 are all concerned with ensuring that people with disabilities can, at the same time, benefit from the provisions for part-time students, volunteers and those on temporary lay-off and restrictions on their availability due to their mental or physical condition. The problems in ensuring that those different regulations interacted properly were identified by the Disability Alliance, and I am grateful to the alliance for alerting my officials and enabling us to set matters right. The majority of the other amendments similarly correct ambiguities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 33 is an amendment not to JSA regulations but to income support regulations. It will ensure that claimants who care for people with disabilities are not faced with the choice of giving up their caring responsibilities or losing benefit. At present, a carer's entitlement to income support is linked to the actual payment of attendance allowance or the higher or middle rate of disability living allowance care component by the person for whom he cares. From 7 October, carers will also be entitled to IS when the person for whom they care has claimed attendance allowance or DLA but the claim has not been decided, or when the claim has been decided and AA or DLA will be paid from a future date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Social Security (Adjudication) Amendment Regulations are, in the main, amendments consequential on the introduction of JSA. In most cases, the amendments amount to little more than the replacement of references to unemployment benefit and income support with references to JSA. However, we require two new adjudication provisions for JSA. Regulation 56A enables an adjudication officer to decide a JSA claim in the jobseeker's favour and for JSA to be paid while the officer is still considering the separate question of a sanction. That makes good commitments that were made during the passage through the House of the Jobseekers Bill that JSA would continue to be paid in full in advance of any sanction decision. Regulation 56B provides that, when a claimant switches to JSA from income support, he will not have to serve the three waiting days that are customary to new claims to JSA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the most part, the regulations do not introduce new provisions. They are necessary to ensure that the provisions of income support and JSA are kept broadly
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
in line where appropriate, and that there is no confusion about the interpretation of certain provisions when JSA is introduced. I commend the regulations to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.37 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Bradley 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Manchester, Withington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for passing on the good wishes of the Committee to my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield. He was taken ill shortly before our proceedings, so I hope that the Committee will understand if my comments are somewhat disjointed. I shall respond as well as I can to the Minister's explanation of the regulations that he presented so clearly and concisely in the past six minutes. We welcome new blood to the Committee. It seems that we have been on a treadmill of regulations on the jobseeker's allowance, and it is always good to see new members of a Committee. I am sure that they will make significant contributions to our debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This not the first time that we have discussed the complex arrangements for the jobseeker's allowance. Perhaps it is ungracious of me to say that that is a tribute to the Government's incompetence and their not being able to lay regulations before the House in an adequate form at the first stage in our deliberations on secondary legislation. However, when the Jobseekers Bill was discussed in Committee, we suggested that the amount of secondary legislation that would be required to implement what is now the Jobseekers Act 1995 would require significant statutory instrument time. I am pleased to see the hon. Member for South Hams (Mr. Steen) in Committee. He has referred to the difficulty in scrutinising secondary legislation when there is so little detail in the Bill</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Steen 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Hams)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that there have been 7,845 new statutory instruments since January 1994? Does he believe that is because the Government's deregulation initiative is not working as well as it should—or because the primary legislation needed to be more tightly drafted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The last time that we debated such matters there were 1,473 new statutory instruments, so the clock continues to tick. On several occasions, the Opposition have said how much the Government rely on secondary legislation to implement policy changes, which undermines our ability to scrutinise legislation properly in Committee. A good example was the Standing Committee considering the Social Security (Incapacity for Work) Act 1994, in which we debated changes to incapacity benefit. The key element of that Act was the change to the medical test, which was dealt with under secondary legislation. We had to try to judge the effectiveness of a new benefit without the ability to scrutinise a key piece of the jigsaw, which was unfortunate. The House might want to consider
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0540">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
the relationship between primary and secondary legislation and how the latter is debated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We debated the original regulations—all 160 pages of them—on 17 January. There were 172 regulations in 13 parts and eight schedules. Nearly four months later, we are debating amendments to 40 of those regulations. In four months, the Government have found 40 out of 172 of their own regulations to be deficient. They are also adding two completely new regulations today. That reinforces the point about the difficulty that officials face when trying to draft complex secondary legislation, especially for social security matters that are complex in themselves. The problem is even greater when trying to introduce a new benefit that cuts across so much previous legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are changes to regulations on crucial matters, such as sanctions against young people, the payment of training allowances, voluntary redundancy, hardship payments, volunteers, part-time students, short-time working, sickness periods, housing costs and occupational pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not go so far as to say that the regulations have been a shambles, but Opposition Members have tried to highlight the difficulties with which we have been presented when trying to scrutinise the legislation. Today's further deliberations testify to that. The campaign against JSA that has been mounted both inside and outside Parliament has forced the Government to look more carefully at the implementation of the scheme—hence the delay until this October.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman mentioned the campaign against JSA outside the House. How will the Labour party respond to that campaign?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to say that the Labour party social security team is looking in detail—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Looking?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may just complete the point, our team is looking in detail at our welfare-to-work strategy, which will be published in the near future. The Tory party will then have an opportunity to debate our proposals and compare them with the shambles of the Jobseekers Act 1995—I had not wanted to refer to it as such, but the Minister's intervention has provoked me into hardening my line.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would like to harden it further. On 17 January, the hon. Member for Makerfield—whose absence we so lament—said in the House that Labour would "get rid" of the jobseeker's allowance. That view was echoed—or may have been echoed; we are not sure—by the hon. Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Meacher) in what, in
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
the past day or two, has become a notorious publication. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman can make the matter clear. Is the Labour party committed to abolishing JSA, or is it reviewing JSA? Given that the hon. Member for Makerfield, the Labour party spokesman, gave an apparently clear commitment in January, I am now somewhat confused.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will have to wait for his confusion to be resolved. I can assure him that those matters are under active consideration, and that we shall produce clear policies—which I am sure will find favour with the public—in due course. The Minister will then have ample opportunity for further comment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Roger Evans)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that mean that, until that review is concluded, the Labour party has no policy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That question is out of order. We are dealing with the statutory instruments in front of us, and I direct the hon. Gentleman not to reply to the question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. McWilliam.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the escalating costs of introduction of the JSA. Ministers claim that the savings to the Exchequer would be £410 million between 1996 and 1998. That was reduced to a net saving of £320 million. In November 1995, however, my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield was told that implementation of JSA would cost £270 million. That was broken down into £110 million for information technology—I shall return to that subject—£70 million for training, £45 million for premises and £45 million for project management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend then found out that £2.1 million had been given in handouts to private sector consultants. He asked about the costs of additional support. In January, on the day after Parliament last had an opportunity to debate JSA and after my hon. Friend had waited for a reply, he was told in a letter from the Minister that a further £8.6 million of taxpayers' money would be spent on consultancy support. That brought the total consultancy fees to £10.7 million. The original projected costs were £270 million, but JSA will now cost more than £280 million. The net savings have been reduced from the original £320 million claimed by the Government to less than £40 million, JSA has not yet even been introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister confirm whether those figures are accurate? What additional costs have since been expended on the project? Is the computer technology now satisfactorily in place, so that the implementation in October will run smoothly? Will he confirm whether the training budget is still fixed at £70 million?

On the subject of training, there has been some debate in the Benefits Agency about the time scale and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0541">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
extent of training of staff. Will the Minister give us an up-to-date position on the training programme, which is crucial to an efficient and effective introduction of the benefit?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 14 April 1995, my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield received a letter from the then Minister of State, Department of Employment, the hon. Member for Maidstone (Miss Widdecombe), who stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Training for front line staff will start in May 1995 and continue until June 1996."</p></blockquote>
That was before there was a six-month delay in the implementation of JSA. What is the current timetable?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a further letter, the hon. Member for Maidstone said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The detailed content of some training programmes is dependent on the legislative process and so cannot be delivered until regulations have been approved."</p></blockquote>
Since the first regulations were approved in January, and we are now amending them again, has that affected the training of staff and the timetable of implementation of the jobseeker's allowance?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the Jobseeker's Allowance and Income Support (General) (Amendment) Regulations 1996. Will the Minister confirm that regulation 3, referring to part-time students; regulation 4, referring to volunteers; and regulation 6, referring to temporarily laid-off and short-time workers will relax the tight definition of availability for work according to a claimant's physical or mental condition, or in the case of regulation 6, the claimant's caring responsibilities affecting that availability? If my reading of the regulations is correct, clearly we in the Opposition welcome those changes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just to shorten the debate, I intervene to confirm that is so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's confirmation. That is clearly another victory for the Labour party's campaign and the campaign by outside organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having welcomed those regulations, we still believe that those relating to temporarily laid off and short-time workers are too strict. Paragraph 4.9 of the White Paper states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"New availability arrangements will apply to those workers who are temporarily laid off work or placed on short-time working by their employer.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>JSA will be available to those 'temporarily stopped' claimants. They will be able to restrict their availability to temporary work, or—if they are on short-time—for the balance of the hours which they do not work.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Those arrangements, however, will be for a limited period of 13 weeks. After that period they must be available to take any job and must be prepared to give up their job in order to do so."</p></blockquote>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield has told the Minister in correspondence, a number of employees have used short-time working over a longer period than 13 weeks to prevent workers being made
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
redundant. It is on that basis that we encourage further consideration of the regulation to ensure that such employees do not run into difficulty. At a time when the Government clearly want to restrict the burden on industry, the cost of redundancy and retraining will not necessarily be in the best interests of employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We debated the pilot project regulation on 25 April. I welcome the amendment in regulation 6 on good cause and the fact that the Minister listened to our arguments at that time and has made the necessary changes. We claim another victory on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is wrong to suggest that that victory was one for the Labour party. I seem to remember that I played a major part in the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly do not wish to suggest that other hon. Members did not contribute to the Labour party's campaign. I welcome the hon. Gentleman's honourary membership to that good cause and the change in the regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, the regulations were debated on 25 April and introduced benefit sanctions for any unemployed person refusing to take part in project work without what the Government deem to be good cause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other questions about good cause were raised, about which my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield wrote to the Minister, and to which he has not yet received a reply. Those questions related to the contractual arrangements for project work. My hon. Friend asked who had sought to provide project work—were potential providers from the voluntary sector, the private sector or a mix of the two—whether they were national or local providers and what type of providers had participated in the bidding process for project work up to that date. The Minister responded in Committee:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am, therefore, not aware of the businesses and undertakings involved nor of their nature and distribution. That information will be in the public domain fairly soon… we expect to finalise providers in the next two weeks."—[
	<i>Official Report, Fifth Standing Committee on Delegated Legislation,</i> 25 April 1996; col. 11.]</p></blockquote>
In the light of that response, I should be grateful if the Minister would today give the Committee the information that we sought then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the draft Jobseeker's Allowance (Amendment) Regulations 1996. Regulation 4 relates to young persons aged 16 or over who have not reached 18 and contributory jobseeker's allowance. As people must have paid two years' national insurance contributions to be eligible for contributory benefit, people under the age of 18 are unlikely to be entitled to it. So that regulation appears superfluous, but I should be grateful for clarification when the Under-Secretary replies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most critical of the regulations is—as the Minister said in his opening remarks—regulation 10, which brings jobseeker's allowance into line with income support for persons seeking asylum. I do not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0542">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
intend to delay the Committee this afternoon by going through all the arguments made by Opposition Members as to why those income support regulations, which flow through to these regulations, should be opposed, although we continue to be of that view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister tell us precisely what savings have been made from people denied benefit while seeking asylum, and what have been the costs to date for local authorities, charities and other organisations who have sought to give support, help, accommodation and sustenance to people who are destitute because they have fallen foul of the new asylum and benefit regulations? The Government claimed that £200 million would be saved by introducing the restrictions. I should be grateful if the Minister would tell us how much of that £200 million has been saved to date, and—on the other side of the balance sheet—exactly what have been the costs to other authorities and how much money the Government have refunded to local authorities which, under the requirements of legislation such as the Children Act 1989, have made payments to families with children who have sought help because of denial of benefit through the social security system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We still strongly contend that the social security system is not the correct vehicle to deal with the problem of bogus asylum seekers. We do not suggest that bogus asylum seekers do not exist, but they should be dealt with by administrative procedures of the Home Office, not by taking benefit away from people who may not be in a position to take an asylum claim at the point of entry in the way that the Government want. I shall not rehearse all the arguments, but we remain implacably opposed to the income support regulations. The fact that they will flow into the jobseeker's regulations means that we shall oppose them for the same reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that I would return to the introduction of the computer system. The White Paper of October 1994 on the jobseeker's allowance stated that its purpose was to
	<br><blockquote><p>"improve the service to unemployed people themselves by a simpler, clearer, more consistent benefit structure, and by better service delivery."</p></blockquote>
I will be grateful for clarification, but it seems that the changes to JSA are creating more work for income support staff—in both transitional arrangements and in the long term. At present, one computer system deals with income support claims and changes connected with incapacity of unemployment. When circumstances change for income support customers—for instance, from unemployment to sickness, or vice versa—details are altered in the computer system. The introduction of the jobseekers computer system means that two completely different systems now perform that function. A case will need to be shut down on one system before it can be re-input onto the other system. The benefit support branch at Wolliton said:
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"It means more work for the user because it would have to be addressed as a brand new claim. It also means a lot of work in the districts as there will not be a link between the JSA and IS system."</p></blockquote>
What is the state of play on the computer technology? Am I right that the two systems are not compatible? Will there be a requirement to work on both systems during the transitional period? Will the Minister confirm that there is no impediment to the introduction of the jobseeker's allowance in October? I am not saying that I should be disappointed if the Government announced a further delay, but what are the Government's intentions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the regulations make technical changes and amend regulations that we debated at length in Committee. I have not yet had notice of when we shall debate the next set of amending regulations. I hope that the Minister will give us advance notice. The regulations are complex and difficult. They are the consequence of the JSA not having been fully thought through when the primary legislation was being debated. That is why we have consistently opposed their introduction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Steen 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Hams)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will make a short contribution, but I hope that it will be helpful. The presumption is that the Government have done their homework in relation to the cost-compliance assessment. Has one been done in this case? If so, what was the result? Are more officials now involved in the work? Have the Act and all the statutory instruments that flow from it resulted in an escalation in the number of staff and in costs? Those are the two matters about which the Government are committed to do something. It would be unfortunate if the cost compliance assessment was neutral on the primary legislation, but showed an increase on the statutory instruments. It would be helpful if the Minister could say something on the costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There must have been an increase in the number of draftsmen, and in the costs, in the Minister's Department. The 7,485 statutory instruments may be the fault of the Opposition party, which ran all those campaigns so successfully—as it believes—that the Government have had to employ more draftsmen to cope with the points that it was making. It would be helpful to know whether the costs of secondary legislation on JSA have rocketed because of the amount of extra work that has to be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not the occasion for a speech on the merits or demerits of statutory instruments, but it is worth pointing out that the Government are committed to deregulation. The Prime Minister said that it was the centrepiece of the Government's economic policy, so my questions are relevant, and I hope that the Minister will be able to answer them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Northfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join my hon. Friend the Member for Withington in welcoming the change brought about by regulation 6. I am grateful to the hon. Member for South Hams (Mr. Steen) for his part in the campaign along with the Labour party. His point—although it might not have been meant in this context—is valid: what is said to be deregulation is often not deregulation at all. There has been a trend towards secondary legislation, which can entail more regulations that are harder to understand and less accessible. We have seen too much of that during the past few years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like other Committee members, I suspect, I cannot claim that, when I found out that I had been appointed to this Committee, I went through each regulation with a fine-tooth comb. Reading through the regulations fairly quickly, I was struck by regulation 12 in the Jobseeker's Allowance and Income Support (General) (Amendment) Regulations 1996, which seems to require that 16 and 17-year-old claimants provide
	<br><blockquote><p>"a declaration to the effect that they have been actively seeking suitable training."</p></blockquote>
In the Committee that considered the Jobseekers Bill, there was much discussion about the words "actively seeking work"—whether they were too restrictive or not restrictive enough and what they meant for claimants. I am concerned about the insertion of regulation 12 without any explanation. I ask the Minister to explain exactly what it means, why it was felt necessary to introduce it now and what the implications are both for the regulations and for young people who will have to provide such a declaration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.9 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Roger Evans)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, am sorry that the hon. Member for Makerfield cannot be with us. We have had so many debates with him about JSA that we miss him this afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Withington said that the amendment regulations were a tribute to the Government's incompetence, but I suggest to him that he is being churlish. These are highly complicated and technical matters, and it is important to get them right. The great victory that he claims for the Labour party—the insertion of a specific good cause—is at best a piece of drafting ex abundanti cautela that expresses something that was probably there in the first place, but it shows that we are engaged in a dialogue. It is important that the Government get such matters right. As my hon. Friend the Minister said earlier, the Disability Alliance made some helpful observations. We amend regulations to get them right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for South Hams has expressed concern about deregulation. I do not accept that any of the three statutory instruments relate to matters that are classically regulatory or deregulatory
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
in the business sense. I can reassure him that the explanatory notes on each one say that they impose no costs on business. The issue is about how to ensure that the Jobseekers Act 1995 and the jobseeker's allowance are brought into effect efficiently and effectively in a way that Parliament intended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Steen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The measure may not be creating additional costs to industry, but is it creating additional costs to Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend will bear with me, I shall explain the sound economics of the operation. The point that I was making is that the jobseeker's allowance is an extremely important Government measure, designed to improve the operation of the labour market and to promote job seeking. No doubt the commercial interests in the country will welcome that, as indeed, will all taxpayers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for South Hams and the hon. Member for Withington asked about expenses and savings. The estimated figure for the one-off cost of implementing JSA is £348 million, so a little more expenditure on draftsmen is a drop in the ocean. There will be direct benefit savings of £240 million in each full year and £60 million in the first year of operation. There are considerable direct benefit savings at stake. Before my hon. Friend the Member for South Hams wonders what is happening, I should say that the legislation is not looked at as whole as a measure designed to save money. When we align it with our job promotion measures and the national insurance contribution holidays, the totality involves more expenditure on the promotion of job seeking to get people back to work and off benefit. The Government believe that that is the right way to approach these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to the questions about computers, if the hon. Member for Withington thinks that the correct and accurate drafting of statutory instruments is complex and technical, I should tell him that the drafting of the computer software is an even more unforgivable task of logic. It is important to get those things right as early as possible. The necessary computer systems will be in place for the introduction of JSA on 7 October this year. Both the income support computer system and the national unemployment benefit system will be used during the transitional period when cases are being converted to the new JSA payment system. The JSA payment system is based on tried and tested technology.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister say how long the two systems will run in tandem on the implementation programme?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am told until July 1997—that shows the efficiency of those who assist me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked about the use of consultants. When we consider the amount of computer technology involved
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0544">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
in the operation—not to mention the problems of training in business processes—it is hardly surprising that the Government have, properly, used consultants. The project has developed a detailed training needs analysis for the staff who will be working on JSA. Detailed training courses have been designed in conjunction with the development of processes and systems. Training is currently in process and it is expected that all necessary training will have been completed before 7 October when JSA comes into operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked specific questions about the new short-time rules, when it was alleged that workers will be forced to leave their employers without redundancy payments. We fully accept that people should be able to claim JSA if they are laid off or put on short time because of temporary industrial problems. For the first 13 weeks, such workers will be treated as available, if they are prepared to resume full-time work with their existing employer or to take casual work while the problems remain. Those problems must be temporary and time-limited. It is not the function of the benefit system indefinitely to subsidise employers. After 13 weeks, people who have been laid off will be able to continue to claim JSA but, like any other claimant, they will have to be prepared to take up a full-time job if one becomes available, even if that means leaving their existing employer. There will of course be no change to the special procedure under which people can apply for redundancy payment if they have been laid off our put on short time for more than four weeks. There is no reason for them to miss out on redundancy payment entitlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the matter of the letter to my hon. Friend the Minister of State Department for Education and Employment on the subject of project work, I do not have the answer to that question to hand, and either I or my hon. Friend the Minister will write to the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked about persons under 18 and contributory JSA. That was a purely drafting point raised by the central adjudicating service, which was concerned that there might be somebody in that class who would otherwise suffer—that is why the order was amended. Few, if any, people are likely to come within that class.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked concerning asylum seekers how much has been saved to date, the costs to local authorities and how much has been refunded to local authorities. It is too early to give the Committee a helpful answer,
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
but I shall write to the hon. Gentleman with such information as is available. The important point is that the numbers are already showing signs of decreasing. We estimated savings of £129 million in the first year—taking into account transitional protection. We cannot readily estimate the deterrent effect of the Government's proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have covered most of the questions. The regulations are an important part of a total package to promote job seeking. It is unclear to Conservative Members what is the Labour party's view. We are saddened that the hon. Member for Makerfield cannot be here to explain his straightforward statement in 
	<i>Hansard</i> that the Labour party would "get rid of JSA". We fail to understand why the hon. Member for Oldham, West should have got into such difficulties apparently for saying exactly the same thing. Whether he has read the article in 
	<i>Red Pepper,</i> or whether it was published without his authority, one would assume that his researcher had simply read 
	<i>Hansard</i> and seen that was Labour party policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
