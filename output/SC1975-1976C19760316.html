	<section>

	<div class='title'>OPERATION OF NOTICE TO QUIT GIVEN BY REASON OF DEATH OF TENANT</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>(1) In subsection (2) of section 24 (restrictions on operation of notices to quit) of the Agricultural Holdings Act 1948—

	<ol>

	<li>for paragraph (
	<i>g</i>) (by virtue of which the consent of the Agricultural Land Tribunal to a notice to quit cannot be required under subsection (1) of that section if the notice is given within three months after, and by reason of, the death of the tenant with whpm the contract of tenancy was made) there shall be substituted—</li>

	<div class='ul'>

	<li>"(
	<i>g</i>) there had died within three months before the date of the giving of the notice to quit a person who immediately before his death was the sole (or sole surviving) tenant under the contract of tenancy, and it is stated in the notice that it is given by reason of the matter aforesaid."; and</li>
</div> <!-- ul -->

	<li>after that paragraph there shall be added—</li>

	<div class='ul'>

	<li>"In paragraph (
	<i>g</i>) of this subsection ' tenant ' does not include an executor, administrator, committee of the estate, trustee in bankruptcy or other person deriving title from a tenant by operation of law".</li>
</div> <!-- ul --></ol>

	<ol>

	<li>This section shall apply to any notice to quit given after the passing of this Act.</li>
</ol></p>

	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, as an amendment to the new clause, in line 11, leave out paragraph (b).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is another obscure point on whether the alteration of the Agricultural Holdings Act in the way that it is being altered by the new clauses leaves loopholes andgrounds for misunderstanding. It is thought that paragraph (b) has an effect that is unintended by the parliamentary draftsman. Section 98 of the 1948 Act defines the tenant as including the persons paragraph (b) excludes. On the death of any of those people the landlord will not be able to serve an effective notice to quit under section 24(2)(
	<i>g</i>). I understand that the Minister's advisers are lookinginto this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister consider the question whether the landlord can serve notice in the following two cases? First, can he serve notice where the 
	<i>de facto</i> tenant in occupation of the land dies when he holds the tenancy as an executor or administrator of a deceased tenant? Secondly, can the landlord serve notice where a 
	<i>de facto</i> tenant is in occupation and has become tenant by reason of a direction of the tribunal under these inheritance provisions? In that case he would have become a tenant by occupation of law and not by contract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>800</span>
The Minister will realise that if the landlord does not serve an effective notice to quit on the death of a tenant someone will derive title from the tenant by the operation of law. That may arise because the landlord has failed to serve a notice within three months of a tenant's death or through ignorance of the death. New Clause 12 could be interpreted as meaning that the successful applicant derived title from the deceased tenant by the operation of law. When the successor dies, surely the landlord should be allowed to serve a notice to quit under Section 24 (2)(
	<i>g</i>). I do not think that the Minister wishes to prevent the landlord from having the right to serve notice to quit, and the legislation enables an applicant to apply in succession by serving a counter notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to look carefully into these matters. The first case is where the tenant in occupation of the land dies when he is the executor and he has held the land as executor or administrator. The second case is where he has become a tenant by reason of the direction of the tribunal and becomes a tenant by operation of the law and not by a contract between landlord and tenant. In those two cases will the landlord be able to serve a notice?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole purpose of these clauses is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0442">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>801</span>
to enable one amongst several people to apply to succeed on the death of a tenant.I hope that the Minister will be able to relieve our minds on these points or promise that he will look into them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be in order to discuss Amendment (e) and Amendments (f) and (g) of new Clause 8.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not mentioned those amendments, which deal with similar matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Jopling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the last sitting I said that we would not seek to move Amendment (
	<i>e</i>) to new Clause 7. We have not withdrawn it from the Paper, Mr. Costain, and I know that you do not have it down to be moved, although I imagine we shall be able to vote on it. I said that we do not intend to move it and I hope that it may be excluded from our discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If hon. Members do not want to talk about it, they need not do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Gavin Strang)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Several points have been raised on this collection of amendments which have already been dealt with. One of them would negate the whole purpose of the clause, as I explained—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the amendment which refers to the assigned tenancies?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, and that is why the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) did not dwell on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of this amendment, Amendment (d), would be to enable a landlord to serve a notice to quit relating to the death of a tenant and incontestable for that reason, in the case of the death of an executor. administrator, or other person holding the tenancy in a fiduciary capacity if they happen to do so on their own, thatis, as sole executor. This would he an inappropriate and quite illogical state of affairs. Naturally, the farm will only vest in an executor or administrator when the death of the farming tenant has already occurred, and it is, of course, in relation to his death that the incontestable notice
	<span class='label label-info column'>802</span>
to quit should he serveable and not in relation to the fortuitous death of a personal representative who is simply engaged in winding up the estate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked what would happen when the tenant was an executor. No change is being made in the existing law. An executor cannot now receive a notice to quit an estate under Section 24(2)(
	<i>g</i>). The hon. Gentleman asked about the position where the executor becomes a tenant 
	<i>de facto</i> through the failure ofthe landlord to serve an incontestable notice to quit when the preceding bona fidetenant dies. The position is unchanged if the landlord should fail so to do, and the executor becomes a 
	<i>de facto</i> tenant. The hon. Gentleman will be the firstto acknowledge that it must be extremely rare for that situation to arise. We do not envisage making any change in that position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Just as there is an onus on the landlord to serve an incontestable notice to quit when the tenant dies, and when he fails so to do he has missed his opportunity, similarly, under the new position, there is an onus on an aspiring near relative to apply to the tribunal and, if he fails to do so within the appropriate time, he misses his opportunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. W. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have returned to what we were talking about at the end of the last sitting, the landlord who does not serve a notice under these new inheritance clauses and just waits. Where, through inadvertence, he fails to serve a notice to quit on the death of the existing tenant, the new tenant will obtain the succession willy-nilly. What onus on the new tenant is there to serve any notice on the landlord under these succession provisions? If he waits three months, he is there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman referring to the case where the landlord does not serve an incontestable notice to quit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There may be an obvious case—where there is one son and the landlord wants him to succeed—which may fall within the hon. Gentleman's category, but where the landlord wants to take over the holding he will have this in mind and will, therefore, make the application.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0443">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>803</span>
Hon. Members have raised a matter which does not bear directly on the new clauses.They are asking that we should take this opportunity further to tidy up the position. I am happy to consider that, to write to hon. Members and, if necessary, to take the appropriate action on Report. These are narrow, highly technical points, but they do not bear on the substance of the new clauses. I think the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West would be the first to acknowledge that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In case there is any misunderstanding, may I explain to the Committeethat we are taking Amendments (d) and (e) together. There may be a Division on Amendment (e) if anyone wants it. We shall not be able to discuss again Amendment (f) when we come to new Clause 8, nor shall we be able to divide on it. We could divideon Amendment (
	<i>g</i>) to new Clause 8, but we cannot then discuss it. Is that clear?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is very clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Costain. I do not understand why we can divide on Amendment (
	<i>g</i>) but not on Amendment (f).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment (f) is on the same point as Amendment (e), but Amendment (
	<i>g</i>) is on a different point. If we decide not to pass Amendment (e), we cannotlater take on a matter on which the Committee will already have decided. Amendment (
	<i>g</i>) is on a slightly different point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>804</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with the Minister that the points I have raised are very narrow. We wish to ensure that we do not leave anything uninvestigated from which may arise a case of hardship on one side or the other. We do not want to findthat we have made some slight alteration in the law and thereby upset the whole ofthe arrangements between landlord and tenant. All we ask is that the Minister giveus anassurance to that effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister did not refer to the second case I put to him where the 
	<i>de facto</i> tenant in occupation has become tenant by reason of a direction of the tribunal. In other words, he has become tenant by the operation of law and not by contract. Iunderstand the point that the landlord does not serve the notice on the executors, but what then happens to the tenant? If no notice has been served, surely the tenancy continues in the name of the executors or administrators, and no one can apply to inherit that tenancy because it has been inherited by the executors who have not been served notice to quit. In that event a son, daughter, grandson or adopted son will be unable to make a claim. The CLA is concerned that these provisions should not muddy up the relationship between landlord and tenant. People should be certain what they are doing. All we are asking is that the Committee should make the position as clear as humanly possible to advisers of the landlord and tenant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main purpose of the clause is to set out those persons to whom the family succession scheme shall apply and those who are excluded from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (1) causes the succession provisions of Part II to apply on each occasion when a tenant or assignee dies and is survived by any of the small range of closerelatives set out in the subsection. These are the widow or widower of the deceased, brother or sister, child, which includes adopted child, and any " treated child "—a phrase imported from the Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 1975. A treated child can include a stepchild, foster-child or a childtaken in without formal adoption, provided that the child was treated by the deceased for any length of time as a child of the family in relation to any marriage towhich he was a party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) requires the Lord Chancellor to set out in an order the procedure tobe followed by a person applying to the Agricultural Land Tribunal for the tenancy of the holding, in particular whom it is that he has to notify of his intentionto apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) is particularly important because it defines eligible person". An eligible person has first of all to be a close relative of the deceased as defined insubsection (1). Secondly, he has to have derived his only or principal livelihood from the holding for at least five years out of the seven years immediately preceding death, thereby establishing a close relationship with that particular land.Thirdly, he may not be someone who is an occupier of a commercial farm elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (4) allows up to three years' training in agriculture at a college or similar educational establishment to count towards the five years' qualifying time actually spent on the holding. A precedent for this is to be found in the Smallholdings (Selection of Tenants) Regulations 1970.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (5) sets out the exclusions from the family succession scheme. The mainones are, first, where the deceased is

survived by a joint tenant with him on the holding which I have already mentioned under new Clause 7. Hon. Members will, I am sure, recall that it is part of the general law of this country that on the death of a joint tenant the tenancy continues in the name of the sole survivor or surviving joint tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the succession provisions are excluded where there is already a valid notice to quit on the holding at the date of the tenant's death which, in one way oranother, has become final. A notice to quit for this purpose is basically one thatis incontestable—based on bankruptcy, for example—or has either beenupheld by the Agricultural Land Tribunal or is one to which the deceased tenant had not objected within the statutory time limit for making objections. It is defined in (
	<i>b,</i>), (
	<i>c</i>) and (
	<i>d,</i>). Paragraph (
	<i>e</i>) excludes fixed term tenancies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another exclusion, and one which has already been debated at length, is where the provisions of the family succession scheme have already applied twice. I should explain here that the average length of a tenancy is between 30 and 40 years. By allowing for the present tenant and two successions we are thereby saying that in normal circumstances a holding can he farmed by the same family for up to 70 or more years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely, if the tenancy were starting from scratch it must be nearer 90than 100 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not challenge that. I am very reluctant to quote any figures, as I think the hon. Member will understand. In some cases it could have expired ina relatively small number of years. In other cases it could be 100 years. As the hon. Member has pointed out, it will depend to some extent on how long the existingtenancy has to run before we actually move into the first of the two successions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point concerned a new tenancy. The Minister has just referred to anaverage length of 30 to 40 years, but with a first tenant and two successions it would be 90 or 100 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a perfectly fair point, although in some instances the durationmight be very much shorter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should be noted that, as a result of subsection (1) of this clause, it is not necessary for succession actually to take place or even for an application for succession to be made. The provisions will apply each time a tenant dies leaving one or more close relatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another major exclusion is a statutory smallholding held by a smallholdings authority—that is to say, a county council—or by the Minister of Agriculture. This has also been debated at length already.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final exclusion is a tenancy of land granted by a charitable trust, the principal object of which is a settlement or employment in agriculture of any persons who have served in Her Majesty's Armed Forces. The purposes of the family successionscheme are clearly not compatible with the terms of these particular charitable trustsand the Government consider, therefore, that they should be excluded. We onlyknow of one such trust in England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (6) provides that, for the purposes of interpretation of " eligible person ", and in a case where a landlord gives as his reason for wishing to regain possession of the holding that he intends to amalgamate it with other land to form acommercial unit within two years, a certificate issued by one of my officials—for instance, a member of the Ministry's Land Service—shall be taken by the Agricultural Land Tribunal to be sufficient proof or otherwise of an assertionthat aholding is a commercial unit.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have very little to say on what the Parliamentary Secretary said. It was really arepetition of the debate we had in the House a week ago last night. It would be wrong to take up a great deal of time at this stage in going over the general principles laid down in new Clause 8. We shall have our opportunities to discuss these oncemore when we debate the Question that the clause be added to the Bill, after we have dealt with the amendments. We have had the opportunity of a full-scale debate on the Floor of the House on exactly these principles, and, as the Parliamentary Secretary said, most of the debate will now be around the particular provisions of new Clause 8. We have discussed the general principles fairly thoroughly already. We have put a number of amendments dealing with the detailed provisions of this long and very important clause. I think we should proceed reasonably soon, therefore, to discuss the amendments. Then we can, if necessary, see what the new clause looks like if the Government accept a number of our amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We said in the debate on the Floor of the House that we felt that this batch of newclauses goes too far. The purpose of our amendments is to take some of the fire outof these new clauses. We are most anxious that the Government accept that in some cases there is no question but that these new clauses go too far. Therefore, we hopethat the Government will accept a good number of the suggestions we shall be makingin the remainder of our discussions on new Clause 8, so that the impact on the farming industry of this clause will not be as great as we fear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We feel that the effect of this batch of new clauses will be that the supply of tenanted land will dry up. There are very many people in the industry who would normally expect to obtain a farm tenancy and who, as a result of this new clause and other new clauses, will not have the opportunity in the future to obtain an agricultural tenancy. I am thinking of farm managers and younger sons and others who, in normal circumstances, would undoubtedly have expected to do this. The whole point of ouramendments will be to try to soften the impact of this new clause and others to a certain extent, and to try to ensure that many of those who would be prevented by the provisions
	<span class='label label-info column'>814</span>
of these clauses from having an agricultural tenancy may view the future with a good deal more optimism. We feel, without going too far that there is a need to softenthe impact of these clauses. It is to that end that we shall be directing our speeches and votes in the debates which lie before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Taking up some of the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) and taking them a stage further, most of the representations I have received in the last week or fortnight have not been totally opposing the Government's proposals, but representations from farmers and landownerswho want to improve these new clauses by ensuring that justice is done to both sides. I have a letter from a member of the Council of the National Farmers' Union who supports the NFU line but who feels that the right to succeed should not go beyond one generation. He feels that strongly, and says that he believes the Government should keep a balance in these matters. If a man claims a tenancy under this legislation he would have a lifetime in which to make arrangements for his son.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems very unfair to the landowner that the farming of a particular piece of land should be restricted for 90 or 100 years. Much of the concern felt by my constituents and by many landowners and farmers in the North-West is because of the increasingly penal tax situation imposed on farmers and landowners—indeed, virtually every citizen. Another constituent comments that if he wanted to take a farm in hand on the death of a tenant, and, probably for tax purposes to meet a tax liability, wanted to sell it, then, if the sitting tenant had designated a successor, a son, or another member of his family, and did not wish to leave the tenancy, the owner's only alternative, if he had to dispose of the farm, would be to sell to another landlord. This would produce a situation in which he would get a much reduced price, because he would not have vacant possession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary appreciates the problems these new clauses will pose for landowners. I can only repeat that landowners and tenants have co-operated remarkably well over many years, but because of change and the more penal taxstructure landowners
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0449">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>815</span>
are having to face increasing problems, and there will be times when they will needto take a farm in hand or to dispose of it. How will they be treated if a farm is valued at a certain price but, because of a sitting tenant and a tenancy succession situation, they will be able to realise the farm at much less than they otherwise might?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Colin Phipps</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a point raised on a number of occasions and it is generally misunderstood. Tenanted land has a value which is an indication of the fact thatit is tenanted, and that value applies for the calculation of capital transfer tax and of other taxes. Therefore the amount of tax reflects the fact that the land is tenanted. So one cannot say that land has a value as a free and unoccupied propertydifferent from the tenanted value. It can only have one value for tax purposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting proposition, but would not my hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) agree that there would not be just one valuefor tenanted land but one value for land occupied by the original tenant, a slightly higher price for land occupied by the son and a slightly higher price still for land occupied by the grandson? The hon. Member for Dudley, West (Dr. Phipps) is totally wrong. There would be not one value, but three.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This raises interesting points which will come up again in these clauses. I believe that both my hon. Friend and the hon. Member are right, but that m hon. Friend is more right than the hon. Member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Phipps</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point is that at the point of taxation, when taxation arises, there is only one value, and that is the same value for disposal and for taxation. The fact that it might vary over a period of time is well understood, and it might vary for different reasons. No doubt, other things will happen over 20 years to cause thevalue to change, but at the time the tax arises there is only one value and that isthe tax value.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Dudley, West (Dr. Phipps) for clarifying the situation as he sees it, but there will be occasions when the landowner will wish to obtain the
	<span class='label label-info column'>816</span>
highest possible market price to meet the massive tax burdens which he is having tobear. While I accept some of the argument of the hon. Member for Dudley, West, I still say that a person who owns an asset should be able to obtain the maximum price if he needs to sell it, particularly to meet a tax liability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to broaden this debate too far because many of the points will be raised on the amendments which we are about to discuss, but I do want to leave the impression with the Parliamentary Secretary that there is a large body of opinion in the NFU, particularly in my area—and I have met a large number of members in the last few weeks—that there should be only one succession and that the categories of those eligible to succeed to a tenancy are obviously drawn too widely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The categories of those who can be considered by the ALT to succeed to a tenancy are drawn far too wide. Taken with the fact that land can be tied up for 80, 90 or 100 years will mean that few, if any, farms will come on to the market for rent, and that few landlords or landowners, if any, will invest any capital in their tenantedfarms at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Body</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did my hon. Friend see in 
	<i>The Times</i> today a letter from the Chairman of the Devizes Labour Party about this? He has done as much for farming as any man in Wiltshire and he say that this clause will make it worse, even for tenants. If my hon. Friend has not seen the letter I commend it to his notice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not seen it. I try to plough through that newspaper at some time every day, but I have not yet done so today. I hope that my hon. Friend will make further reference to the letter, and even read it to the Committee. I am delighted that the Chairman of the Devizes Labour Party supports my view of this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not trying to obstruct the Government. We want justice for the landowner as well as to the tenant to ensure that the good relationship which has existed between landowner and tenant from the beginning continues, and that farms come on to the market so that a young person can come in and add the weight to the farming industry which is vital to it. As I said on Second Reading, this
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0450">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>817</span>
country has to produce more food from its own resources than ever before because ofthe sinking £. I am not sure that this clause would generate that investmentwhich is vital.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might help to make the position quite clear if I say that now is the time to discuss new clauses 14 and 15, which we are now considering. There was asuggestion that there could be further discussion on Second Reading. It is possibleto refer to them now. If the Committee wants to debate them, now is the time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Costain. As we are dealing with a clause moved bythe Minister it would be useful if these two new clauses were spoken to first.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is why I drew attention to the position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Caerwyn E. Roderick</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important that we as a Committee support New Clauses14 and 15 now. If there will be no opportunity for later discussion of them, whatever we think, in order to keep a dialogue going, we must support them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is patently obvious that my contention from the beginning, that the situation is different in different areas, is true. If the President of Devizes Labour Party can write and speak against these Government new clauses it shows that the situation there is different from that in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> That is what we said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Roderick</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case I do not see anything in this legislation which will be harmful for other areas. We are only protecting, as we have said all along, tenants who have a bad landlord. This should not harm relationships where the landlord-tenant relationship is good, and for that reason these Government clauses deserve our support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to new Clause 15, we have made the point elsewhere that it is dangerous to wait for the death of an elderly tenant for the succession to be settled. There are
	<span class='label label-info column'>818</span>
far too many cases where a tenant in hanging on because of insecurity otherwise for his family, and where a son or other relative is having to carry out the work on a farm. It would surely be better for agriculture and for that farm if the question could be settled before the death situation arose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My one misgiving about new Clause 14 is that it does not make clear that it should be voluntary retirement. It must be voluntary retirement or the situation will be intolerable, if the tenant is forced to speedy retirement in order for the family succession to continue. I would not accept any new clause which would force the tenant to retire at 65. It must be done by agreement in the family. One could stipulate an age, but what about illness? One cannot stipulate the degree of illness the word" voluntary " must be evident here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I question the whole business of the two successions. There will be plenty of opportunity when we discuss the amendments to new Clause 8 to go into detail so I shall not do so now. However, the theory is that an average tenancy lasts between 30 years and 40 years. Over a period of time, if there is succession from father to son, successive tenancies cannot last on average 30 to 40 years—it implies that the eldest son is born to a family every 35 years or so, which is not true. The average succession is shorter than 30 years to 40 years. It would be on the average age of the tenant farmer when the first son is born. I may be wrong, but that is my figure. Therefore, that rules out 90 years to 100 years completely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Howells</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: For information purposes I point out that my neighbour, Mr. Jones, and his family, have been farming for eight generations.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not necessarily the eldest son who will succeed to the tenancy. Perhaps the statistics put forward by the hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Roderick</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we are talking about the " average ", it will as often as not be the eldest son. He would be the natural successor. It is known that I oppose the idea of two successions because it would lead to intolerable difficulties. At which succession do we start counting for the two? After the Bill becomes an Act? Or do we count retrospectively? When do we decide? Agreement could be reached between the landlord and tenant that the first succession will start in 50 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We can argue whether it will be 70 years or 100 years. If the hon. Gentleman appreciated that if he let his farm he could not regain possession of it for 70 years, 80 years or 90 years, would he let it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Roderick</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would be a matter for the ALT. A sensible, midway house for argument and discussion is better than a situation where everything is balanced on one side perhaps I should not use the word " balance".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has got this wrong. My hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Benvon) referred to a case where an ALT does not decide to give the tenancy to any of the relatives. The landlord then has to let the farm on the open market. Would a landlord let further land on the open market? I do not believe that in those circumstances, and knowing that he would tie the land up for 60 years, 70 years. 8O years, or may be 120 years, he would. We must apply our minds to a fresh letting of the land which will still be available to let after all these successiops, and the ALT has done its job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The question of the supply of tenanted farms has been vastly overplaved in this Committee and elsewhere. That is not the situation in my area. Very few tenanted farms come on the market. and that has been the situation for many Years. To argue that the supply will dry up is not sensible, because there is virtually nothing to dry up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tax burden is, again, being overplaved. I should be interested to have further figures, in addition to those which
	<span class='label label-info column'>820</span>
I have already received from the Treasury. It is an interesting situation that the combination of capital transfer tax and capital gains tax since this Government have been in office has had less effect than the previous taxation on farms up to quite considerable sizes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. We cannot have that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: 200 acres?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Roderick</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have figures for 500 acres. They will he published shortly. I shall ask the Chancellor to publish figures for the break-even point, which, I suspect, will reach 900 acres, and then we shall know the extent to which this Government have been responsible for the drying up of tenanted farms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are making a breakthrough in this new clause in particular and the other new clauses in general. New Clause 8 is the central core for the succession situation. I hope it will receive a Second Reading, together with new Clauses 14 and 15. it does not mean that ultimately we shall support them, but I should like to hear more about new Clause 14.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I go a long way with what the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick) has said in relation to retirement and so on. We must consider the question of time not from the point of view of the existing tenant of a farm but from the point of view of new lettings, because that is what we have been talking about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to go into the argument raised by the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor about taxation, but even if he is right that the break-even point is higher than I believe it to be, which is about 200 acres, the element of let land is unlikely to come about till the acreage is much more than that. Therefore, the number of farms on the market is affected by the imposition of taxation. That is another matter and does not concern the new clause to which I refer at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is obvious that this clause will be passed, but if we accept the principle of two successions we can argue about who is and who is not eligible. Inevitably we are talking about a long period. I am an agricultural landlord, and I have never yet refused a near relative the succession of a tenancy, but one of the great diffi-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0452">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>821</span>
culties is that a farmer will stay on too long. Modern farming is an extremely skilled and technological operation. Anyone who is not skilled and proficient will go under quickly. Therefore, nothing is sadder than an existing tenant who should have retired long ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had understood that that was the burden of the case advanced by Labour Members for these provisions. However, these provisions will not as they stand alter the situation. A farmer will continue in tenancy because death is the point at which succession takes place. Throughout this clause and the whole Bill it is death which is the point at which succession takes place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My new clause 14 seeks to ensure that succession can take place on the sixty-fifth birthday of the existing tenant. I am not a lawyer or a draftsman. I have probably got this wrong in draft, but that is why I want to tell the Minister what I want. I am after an agreed retirement between landlord and tenant. The point at which that occurs should be at the age of 65 unless the landlord is prepared for the tenant to continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There would be very few cases of hardship. I can conceive of no landlord who would force a family to give up the tenancy. However, if there were a cantankerous old farmer who would not let his son take over the farm, which is steadily going down, the landlord should be in a position to agree to succession before death, provided that the father retires at 65 years. The father may refuse, and the landlord can go to the Agricultural Land Tribunal, which will judge. If hardship can be avoided by reference to the ALT for other clauses. why cannot it apply to this clause? The number of cases will be very few and far betweep and in nine cases out of ten agreement will be reached between the tenant's family and the lapdlord that succession can take place at the age of 65.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my experience. almost always the son has been brought into the tenancy at a much earlier age and the father gradually fades out of the picture. In many cases the son is glad to have his father in partnership because the old can help the young and vice versa. However. there are cases where the situation is not as clear cut, where a farm is running down and where a young successor should take over the tenancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>822</span>
That is what I am after. If I have the wrong wording I shall be the first to acknowledge it. I hope that the matter will be considered by the Department and dealt with on Report. I do not seek compulsion except where there is a disagreement and in that case it should be resolved by the ALT.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend seeks to emphasise and solicit from the Minister that an agreed succession should count towards the two successions stipulated in the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that clear. This cannot take place till the Bill comes into force, but it will be two after the existing tenancy. That would be the first succession, and so on after that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Phipps</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support new clause 15. I am grateful that the hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Benyon) has clarified his position. There are some dangers in having a fixed age. It is all very well to say that good landlords will take these matters into consideration, but we have not been legislating for the good landlord: we have always been legislating for the potentially bad one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The essence of new Clause 14 would be improved if the word "voluntary" were included in it. I do not understand why a man at the age of 50 or so cannot pass a tenancy to his son. There could he many reasons for some one wishing to give up a tenancy, and they might have nothing whatever to do with the fact that he is a farmer. They might be personal reasons. I am concerned that voluntary relinquishment should be included in what are two excellent new clauses. which I hope the Committee will accept. Voluntary retirement will. to some extent, shorten the average length of tenancies. One reason for long tenancies is that farmers have staved on for many years and the tenancies have often been given to grandsons, certainly to younger sons, rather than to the elder sons. It is extremely valuable that considerable freedom should be given to a tenant to pass a tenancy to his son or some other eligible person at pretty well any time for any sensible reason during the period of his tenancy. That would shorten the period of tenancies and meet some of the points raised by Conservative Member.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to discuss one of the general principles of new Clause 8, which is a particularly stringent clause. In everything in new Clause 8 there is the assumption that the tenant is capable of supporting two adult families—that the holding is large enough to support a father and his son. There is some sense of legal requirement whereby the holding has to have been the successor's principal source of livelihood for five of the past seven years. This assumes that the particular holding can support two farmers, but this will not always be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It also appears to me to be implicit, under the legal requirement, that the successor should not already be occupying a commercial holding. It may be that the commercial holding a man has is small and that the one his father is relinquishing is a bigger commercial holding which the son would like to have. I see no great objection to a tenant running two holdings; plenty of farmers run more than one farm. However, there seems to be an assumption throughout new Clause 8 that the single holding for which we are legislating is always able to support two families. If it cannot, then it is hardly likely that a son will be living and working on it during the previous seven years and is unlikely to have done so since reaching his majority. This part of the clause needs to be changed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to thank the Minister for the background document giving details of the number of holdings held, which has been helpful. I am asking for other information, and if he could give this in advance, that, too, would be helpful to myself and, no doubt, to others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of valuation hardship a particular case was mentioned, and the valuation was gone into in some detail. It was a case where taxation had arisen through the death of an owner before this particular aspect was mentioned on Second Reading of the Bill and when no one thought of being a succession tenant. The moment there is mention of a succession tenant the value of a holding is reduced, but the valuation will have taken place on a day before there was any such mention, so that that factor could not have been taken into account. Money has to be raised, usually spread over seven years, and death duty must be paid during
	<span class='label label-info column'>824</span>
a time when the holding would be unable to realise its normal value of a year before.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Phipps</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not the hon. Gentleman accept that in the normal commercial market the price of agricultural land goes up and down around the point of death? That may be an added factor, but it is hardly a new one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree. I myself inherited from my father, who was occupying at the top of some Labour Chancellor's Budget in 1948, and after that the value was always much less; but I entirely agree with what the hon. Member says.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, that is a new factor which is introduced here, through legislation, and it had not been mentioned when the farmer died.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would again draw attention to the question of managers in relation to people coming out of agricultural colleges. In my part of the world they feel very sore about the introduction of these new Clauses. Some of those who have passed through agricultural colleges, although they take jobs on holdings as managers and so on, long to take holdings of their own. I do not believe there will be the remotest possibility of their being able to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that the supply was drying up before. One of the main reasons for that is taxation on land. One can argue whether it is greater now by measurable degree than it was under a Conservative Government, but it is taxation of land, and particularly the capital transfer tax, which is driving landlords off the land, particularly where they have to act to get any benefit of remission of that tax. I hope the Minister will give thought to that. It is driving away some of our better young men from farming, and the only way they will be able to farm is to go elsewhere. Australia and elsewhere, of course, but I do not want those better young men to have to leave.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister has been so helpful in the past in giving information perhaps he could refresh my memory and the memory of others in the Committee on the question of smallholdings and selection of tenants under the 1970 Act. If it were possible for that to be done before we reach the amendment dealing with statutory smallholdings I would he very grateful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether information on com-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0454">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>825</span>
mercial units has been brought up to date recently or whether many have remained the same for a number of years. Times change, and I believe some holdings may not now be commercial units. There may have been considerable changes. The hon. Member for Dudley, West (Dr. Phipps) said he would not mind someone working more than one commercial holding. Personally, I would. I would object. In my constituency a holding of 14,000 acres is being run by a particular company. I feel it would be far better if that were split up into 14 1,000-acre farms, giving 14 tenants an opportunity to have land. We have such instances up and down the country. Some of these large holdings are extremely well run, but of some, beyond a certain size, particularly when they are spread over 30 or 40 miles, the management is not so productive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Phipps</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not the hon. Gentleman agree that the converse is also true and that there are marginal holdings of small size which could be run in cooperation, which might be an economic advantage?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That shows the vast difference between one side of the country and the other. In my area we have arable land sometimes owned by a combine or pension fund, sometimes farmed by the fund itself. I am not very fond of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the Minister will look at whether the Agricultural Land Tribunals have been brought up to date and will be ready with some answers on whether in some cases the delays have not been too long. ALTs will need to be brought up to date and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether he will look at that and say whether the assessors have been called upon recently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe certain consequences will flow from the alternatives, which will not be to the benefit of agriculture. We have spoken of the drying up of holdings and so on, but I believe rent will considerably increase for every bit of land. It must do. There must be a national commercial figure. Because of lack of investment the landlord will not be able to afford to provide new equipment and that will mean that the tenant will have to provide much more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As admitted on both sides of this Com-
	<span class='label label-info column'>826</span>
mittee, relationships on 80 to 90 per cent. of holdings of let land have been good. In future, relationships will be soured, because a landlord will be in duty bound to serve notices to quit, and then all those who may think they have a chance of the succession will put in their claims and there will be some rare old family rows over who is to be the successor. Formalising this, making it a necessity for both landlord and tenant to start serving notices and appear before the Agricultural Land Tribunal, quite apart from the question of expense, will make for bad relationships and will harm existing good ones. It has always been the pride of the countryside that, generally speaking, the relationships have been extraordinarily good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I certainly totally back up the intention behind the New Clause 14. As with so many other matters which concern legalities, I cannot follow that clause any more than I can follow many others, but I hope that some way will be found of putting into effect what the new clause seeks. Generally, it is a good thing to bring someone into partnership, as joint tenant, a son perhaps at the age of 45 or 50, so that there is not a sharp break when the holder reaches 65. It is a good idea to bring a son or some other relative in with the tenant fanner at an earlier age to work with him. This helps with the provision of capital on a holding. If father and son do not need capital in the holding and the son is able gradually to acquire more over the years, that is good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There seems to be some objection from the Government side to my hon. Friend's proposal in new Clause 14 to refer matters to ALTs. I cannot understand why it should be said that this must not be compulsory, but must be voluntary. I believe hon. Gentlemen are speaking of the ALT being used where a tenant has a bad landlord who will not allow the tenant's son to inherit. Surely, there must be, too, bad tenants, whose landlords do not want them to go on farming and would prefer the tenants' sons to take over. Although I have no great enthusiasm for the ALTs surely they are the only people to do that. I cannot think of anyone else who would be in a comparable position vis-à-vis the landlord, and the tenant also in this case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I am all for doing away with hardships—and I know of some—I feel that we shall end up with a very different atmosphere in the countryside as a result
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0455">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

Some of the arguments are misplaced. Although the new tax provisions are extremely steep for large farms they are more generous than were the pre-1974 taxation proposals for farmers of 500 acres and below. That is not a new factor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In view of this almost unprecedented situation, I do not know whether the Government will wish to adjourn the proceedings. You spoke about precedents at our last sitting, Mr. Costain. I do not know whether we have ever had such a precedent. I do not know what the " succession " will be. In view of the turmoil into which the Labour Party and the country have been put, do not the Government wish to adjourn the proceedings?

	<div class='membercontribution'>: One problem which is fairly attributable to taxation is the nature of the capital tax and the fact that agricultural reliefs are based on the operations of the full-time working farmer. That might be an added inducement to the landlord to take back the tenancy.

Arguments that have been put forward about the alteration in the relationship between the landlord and tenant in the sense of troubles and tensions, but such
	<span class='label label-info column'>828</span>
tensions have not been experienced in Scotland. The Scottish NFU accepts that the Scots do not welcome security of tenure proposals. Few representations have been made in Scotland since and that is a useful guide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not that for a long time that was the case and, therefore, it has been accepted on the Scottish scene?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not quite accepted on the Scottish scene. It applied for nearly 10 years between 1949 and 1958. Then we had the system adopted in England. We had 10 years of security of tenure; a period of 10 years without security of tenure; and since then there has been security of tenure. Those three periods provide a good way of estimating feelings on the matter. One strong point which emerges is that during the period from 1958 to 1968 there was no appreciable increase in the number of farms coming up for lease. In other words, there was no great effect on the flow of tenancies. The argument has always been between security of tenure on the one hand and the bad landlord on the other. We all accept that the good landlord applies this principle where he can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not a member of the Scottish Bar, but surely before the period to which the hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not making a comparison between the land law in Scotland and that in England. We are dealing only with whether security of tenure affected the flow of tenancies available. That is a factor we can distinguish, and we did not have that experience in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I strongly support new Clause 15. I agree that the provisions should be extended to where a tenant retires through age or illness. That provision was omitted in the original new Clause 8 and it should be included. Conservative Members have often argued that farmers hang on too long before giving up their tenancies. I hope that that new clause will be accepted.

We shall shortly be discussing an amendment which deals with farm workers and it may help us to deal with the problems raised in connection with the flow of tenancies.

many farm workers I have in my constituency but perhaps the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Miss Maynard), who frequently looks after the farm workers, is better informed than I am. I think that there are several thousand, several hundred of whom look forward to the day when they have a small holding, pass through the gateway and become farmers on their own account. In Lincolnshire we have had a happy record over the years of farm workers becoming farmers. A large number of farmers have begun farming careers as employees on another farm.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that so many farm workers in the hon. Gentleman's part of the world are becoming farmers.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no problem, because we have good land to farm. We are not farming on the Welsh mountains on marginal land. We have good land, and a man can earn a living on l0 acres. The largest landlord in the Room—on the Labour side of the Committee—insists that many of his tenants should have no more than 10 acres; he expects them to earn a livelihood from those 10 acres, and they succeed. In my area farm workers take over two or three acres, develop them, and earn a supplementary income. From that income they acquire another field, and another field, as tenants, and later, sometimes, as owners. In that way they go through the gateway to ownership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That cannot be done in Wales. The opportunity for farmers in East Anglia to make the best of the rich arable land deteriorates rapidly in other counties where the land is not so good and is brought into cultivation for wheat and other commodities which should not be grown on such land. That is the consequence of stupid agricultural policy supported by—at times—both Front Benches.

The simplicity of this branch of the law is going out of the window. As we throw it out I hope that we shall pause to recognise the long-standing corelation between simplicity and respect for the law. My main fear about the new clauses is that the large landowner, particularly the institutional landowner, will pass them off with a shrug and get round them. When large landowners, insurance companies or pension funds, are putting money into something, they call upon the best lawyers and the best surveyors to advise them. There is no doubt what advice they will be given from now on. They will not give a straight lease to anyone who comes forward. They will not give a straight lease to the people referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree whole-heartedly with what he said. Competent, well-informed, go ahead, energetic young men are coming from our agricultural colleges. They look forward to the day when they can have their own farms—not necessarily as owners but as tenants—be responsible for, make them their own concern and not just manage them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The institutional landowners will say to the young man who has had a course of training at an agricultural college "We shall be delighted to have you as a tenant, but you will not be a tenant of the old kind. We shall set up a farming company, which will be the tenant. You will have 49 per cent. of the capital but we shall have a majority shareholding." This majority shareholding will entitle them to dissolve that farming company whenever they wish, it will be set out quite clearly in the memorandum and articles of association that the institutional landowners will have the right to dissolve the company and bring the partnership to an end. In that way it will be able to evict, when it so wishes, the so-called tenant, be he 65 or any other age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This may seem tolerable to some, but what worries me particularly is that I do not think that agriculture will have a perpetual boom. I think we are now on the slide down. These institutional landowners will be managed from London. They will have to look at balance sheets and other criteria and not at some of the more sentimental criteria used by neigh-
	<span class='label label-info column'>832</span>
bouring landowners. They will look at the books and apply harsh materialistic criteria. If the farming company is not paying, they will seek to get rid of it by dissolving the company, and in that way evicting the tenant. That is as certain as can be if farming continues the downhill decline which is now becoming apparent. The institutional landlords will in that way do great harm to the lives of very many talented young farmers. These institutional landlords will be aided by the provisions of the Bill if we are not very vigilant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This was the point made by Mr. Cave in his letter in 
	<i>The Times</i> today, to which I referred earlier, and which I commend to the Parliamentary Secretary. Mr. Cave is a most distinguished farmer. He was a Labour candidate for Devizes and stood twice, I think. He farms some 2,000 acres. I believe that he was an officer, if not the chairman, of the Labour Party agricultural organisation, the name of which eludes me. He has given his life to agriculture and has worked extremely hard for the Labour Party. At the moment he is President of the Devizes Labour Party. I hope that his opinion will be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These provisions will not help the tenant farmer in the long run. They will injure a large number of small landlords, who will not resort to the devices used by the large institutional landowner or the large private landowner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that Socialists will bear with me as I give the details of a family with a Labour background. On Saturday at my surgery a docker's widow came to see me. She was widowed some six years ago, when dockers were earning about £50 a week. Now in Boston they earn more than double that. When her husband was earning £50 a week they were able to save up enough to buy a smallholding which is typical of the kind existing in Norfolk and Lincolnshire. It is only a very small one. She has now become destitute. As a landowner she is the kind of person who is hit by these provisions. This case illustrates the dangers involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I honestly believe that the Government are not aware of the kinds of landlords existing in this country. This docker's widow is not untypical of people owning a very few acres, and who have put the whole of their savings into their small pieces of land. The typical landlord in this country is the person with just a few
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0458">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>833</span>
acres, and with all his savings locked up in that land. The typical landowner is not the rural magnate, the member of the squirearchy—the man who causes such emotional reactions in the minds of hon. Members on the Government side.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I interrupt only because I want to be able to respond adequately to the hon. Gentleman later. Will he explain how this docker's widow will be adversely affected by the new clauses? I have not been able to follow his argument in that respect so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Body</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not surprised that the Parliamentary Secretary has not understood, because I have not yet spelled out her problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
She is a widow with six children. Five are now able to earn their own livelihood. Only one is now at school. This widow works as a school cleaner and earns £11 a week. Her only other income is the small amount of rent she gets for the smallholding. Taken together, her income is derisory. As she explained to me, she would have been much better off if she had been on social security after the death of her husband.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that the Parliamentary Secretary should have the look on his face that he now has, and is not showing any concern for a person such as this. I hope he is not an example of the new technocratic elite that is to dominate the Labour Party. Those who founded the Labour Party used to have some concern for people with this lady's background. She is now in a very serious financial position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that new Clause 14 could well come to her aid, because her tenant is now over 65 and has no intention of leaving, as matters now stand. This is why it is relevant. The Parliamentary Secretary still looks as though he has no interest in the subject at all, but I beg him to understand that in England—particularly in the part I represent, and that represented by my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins)—there are many hundreds of tenanted smallholdings. Of course, there are some large landlords. One of the very bad landlords is a large one. Perhaps he will understand some of the problems when he meets his tenants, as he has now promised to do, later this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This example illustrates the absurdity
	<span class='label label-info column'>834</span>
of the law into which we shall now plunge ourselves. New Clause 14 would help in this direction. At the very least, new Clause 14 would go some way towards preventing from occurring in future examples such as this I have given. This widow would be able to reach an agreement with her tenant, so that there might be some possibility of his retiring. I hope there will be support for the new Clause 14.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope also that we shall be very vigilant, in passing this legislation, so that we do not do anything more to assist the institutional landowners. If we do, it will not be to the advantage of the agricultural industry in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Joan Maynard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should not think that any of my hon. Friends would want to do anything to assist the big institutions which have moved into agriculture, or which might move in. Certainly I should not myself wish to help them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) has talked about the small landowner or the small landlord. This sort of argument is always produced against new legislation affecting landlords and tenants. Although this is the sort of argument put forward, Conservative Members are not concerned with the small landlord, the docker's widow. They are concerned with protecting the big landowners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, no.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Maynard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member disagrees, but, throughout our political history, whenever the question of public ownership has arisen, there has always been reference by the Conservatives to the small shareholder with £2,000 worth of shares, when really the purpose of the exercise has been to protect the big shareholder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a good deal of myth concerning farm workers moving on to farms and becoming tenant farmers. I accept that this does not necessarily apply in the area represented by the hon. Member for Holland with Boston. It is a particularly fertile area in which people can make a living on a much smaller farm than would provide a living elsewhere. Therefore I accept that it is more likely that a farm worker will become a tenant farmer of a very small farm in that kind of area, but, generally speaking, in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0459">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>835</span>
practice today it is extremely difficult for a farm worker to become a tenant farmer, even on a small farm, because of the vast amount of capital needed. That is the practical situation, and it would be foolish to pretend otherwise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to take up a point mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Benyon). In talking to his new Clause 14—I fully support its objectives, and also the objectives of new Clause 15—he seemed to imply that today farmers who are over the top go out of business. They do not. They remain in business, but they do not operate to their best advantage or use their land to the best advantage. This is a very sad situation. For that reason, I fully support the objectives behind the two new clauses 14 and 15. I believe that they would be very helpful to agriculture, enthusiasm and progress in agriculture. There would be new people coming forward very much sooner, with new ideas to use the land to the maximum advantage. This is more necessary now than, perhaps it has been in recent years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a question to put to the Parliamentary Secretary and to some of his hon. Friends. I regret that the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) is not present, because I should like to ask what is the official view of the trade union movement concerning retirement at 65. Unless I am much mistaken, the trade union movement, particularly in times of high unemployment, seeks to ensure by others, thus reducing the present intolerable level of unemployment. Perhaps once again we are seeing that there is one rule for those op the Government side and another for the rest of us. I wonder what the official view of the trade union movement is about retirement at 65? It is the policy, unless I have been seriously misled, of the National Union of Mineworkers to ask its sponsored M.P.s to retire at 65. So, perhaps, great weight is given to the new clause which my hon. Friend has moved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Maynard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot speak for the trade union movement, but I would personally be in favour of the retirement age for men being reduced to 60. That is an entirely different matter. When we speak of the retirement of a tenant farmer we are talking not only about his retirement
	<span class='label label-info column'>836</span>
but about his losing his home when he retires. I am in favour of a retirement clause being put in, but I would like to see it left as a voluntary decision by a tenant, and not have him being pushed out by the landlord, or by a son who wants to take over and move the tenant not only from his farm, but from his home.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that intervention because my view is that local authorities should—in some areas they do—take responsibility for and provide accommodation for people who, through retirement or ill health, cannot run a farm satisfactorily. In Macclesfield the Macclesfield Borough Council and the Congleton Compton Borough Council give sympathetic consideration to any tenant farmer or farm worker forced to move from his job. They are given priority in local authority housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is my hon. Friend's intention, if the new clause is accepted, that if tenants are required to retire, full consideration should be given to their need for accommodation. A tenant should be allowed, if he has no other accommodation, to keep a dwelling on the holding during his lifetime, with his spouse if he has one. This should not cause difficulty, because the relative taking over would, presumably, not require, himself new accommodation but would be living in the farm house, or near the farm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be necessary to ensure that succession should be limited to two occasions. We have made that clear early.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand and appreciate and accept the point which the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Miss Maynard) raised. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary or the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) would comment on the position of the trade union movement as a whole towards retiring at 65 and about people over 65 occupying jobs which could be more usefully taken over by younger people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If only because it was raised by the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West I wish to take up the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is important. If we are to get involved in housing we shall be in difficulty. My clause is worded in this way: if housing were the only stumbling block it would be up to the tribunal to judge whether there would be hardship.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0460">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>837</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Winterton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted by that intervention. I tried to make that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West, said that we were talking about tenants taking over. I hope he is aware of the committees which have sat to consider agricultural education committees like the Pilkington Committee in 1966, which produced a useful report. There is a difference between farm craft and agricultural education in the widest sense. It is desirable that people who take over farms in this day and age should have the skills of farm management and accountancy. Those are vital to agriculture. If a farm worker has been able to take agricultural education I hope he is properly considered for any tenancy for which he applies or is eligible under this clause, but I hope the hon. Gentleman is not saying that anyone, with no skill in agriculture, should be eligible for a tenancy because it is vital to make the maximum use of our land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully support the objects of new Clause 14 and the more simple form which is laid down in new Clause 15. It would be helpful, if the clause is not acceptable in its present form, if other words could be produced on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Howells</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome new Clause 8. I have listened this morning and in the past few weeks to the debate. It is a step in the right direction to safeguard the interests of the son or daughter of a tenant farmer on the death of the father. It will do a great deal of justice if a son is allowed to farm his father's farm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one looks at the figures given to me a few weeks ago one finds that 50 per cent. of farms in Scotland are farmed by tenants and 50 per cent. by owner-occupiers. In England 108,000 are managed wholly by owner-occupiers and 65,400 are rented. In Wales 22,000 are farmed by owner-occupiers and only 10,600 by tenant farmers. I therefore accept the view expressed by the hon. Members on both sides that the position varies from one part of the country to another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Farmers' Union of England and Wales, the Welsh Council,
	<span class='label label-info column'>838</span>
and the Council of the Farmers' Union of Wales are in favour of Clause 8. The majority of landlords in our part of the world and tenant farmers will accept Clause 8. We have a few reservations, and hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will do their best to try to ease the worries we have in different sections. At the end of the day this is a piece of legislation that will bring justice to the agricultural industry where farmers' sons have a right to farm for many years to come.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be for the convenience of the Committee if I said at the beginning a little about the new clauses, on the understanding that we shall be returning to these matters when we debate the question of adding them to the Bill. The moving and voting of the new clauses will take place as prescribed by the Notice Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that if we are to provide for death we should by analogy provide for retirement, too. However, we found that once we considered one consequential change another appeared in its train. This clause illustrates my point. The argument runs that if we provide for family succession on death we should provide for it on retirement of the tenant through old age, but if we do that it is said that we should provide for retirement through illness, and if we do that, that we should provide for retirement through accident as well. My hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick) in his new clause brings out these points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We said during the earlier debate that we intended to make this a limited scheme. One point on which we should be clear is that we are legislating for the situation where there is no unanimous agreement among the three parties. The three paries are the landlord, the existing tenant, and the aspiring tenant. Where there is mutual agreement among those three parties there is no problem and transfer of tenancy takes place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand the Bill as drafted, if a transfer takes place by agreement it does not count as succession, unless notice to quit is given. Succession by agreement does not count as succession in relation to this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is true, and it is one consideration, but there are others to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0461">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>839</span>
which I wish to come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do we want to make this a situation which can arise when a landlord does not wish it? When the aspiring tenant can apply to the Agricultural Land Tribunal—I talk in general terms because we are not bound by the precise wording of this clause, and several Members have indicated their support for the general principles involved—we have to bear in mind precisely the situation for which we are legislating. We might have a situation where a son wishes to take over and the father is in agreement but the landlord is opposed. The situation which was hinted at by the hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Benyon) was that in which the landlord wanted it to take place, the son wanted it to take place, but the father did not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are hon. Members on this side who would have reservations. That is the impression I gained, but the purpose of my preliminary remarks is to indicate to hon. Members that I recognise the strength of interest in this matter. It is clear from the speeches of all hon. Members that there is a great desire on the part of the Committee that we should seek to do something on these lines although it will involve most serious problems. I will leave it there, and come back to it when we discuss this on adding the clause to the Bill. I can then be more specific about the Government attitude to the general principle of incorporating a completely new concept into these provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary could clarify one point and give the Committee an assurance. It is correct to say that we could perhaps consider this in greater detail in the debate on adding the clause, but will he say, if a draft can be worked out on the grounds of three parties being agreeable to a succession by agreement, whether this could be incorporated in a clause such as new Clause 14, where all three would be agreeable to succession taking place at that stage before death? That would be helpful. That was the point my hon. Friend tried to make in introducing his new clause. When all three, father and tenant, son who will succeed, and landowner, desire that succession should take place, could it be incorporated in a clause such as these new Clauses 14 and 15?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>840</span>

	<p>12.30pm.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Benyon) made that precise point in his interjection. We shall look at this matter. It will arise when we consider the amendments to the two generations provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to comment briefly on some of the remarks of hon. Members. The matter of the drying up of tenancies was raised. We must be quite clear that if a landlord wishes a son or a near relative to succeed, nothing is changed by this legislation in relation to new tenancies. If the landlord decides that a son should not succeed under the present legislation, he does so for a number of reasons. The extent to which this change will reduce the number of tenancies depends upon how frequently the landlord in that situation relets the farm to an incoming tenant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will have examined some of the surveys carried out on this matter, including a recent one by the County Landowners Association, from which it appears that only in a minority of cases does a landlord in that situation relet the farm to another tenant. We all know the reasons. It is partly due to the trend towards more owner occupation. There are all sorts of reasons for the landlord refusing to allow a son to take over but not wanting an incoming tenant. He may wish to sell the farm, he may wish his own son to succeed, or even to take over the farm himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the question of the drying up of new tenancies applies only to the situation in which the landlord refuses a relative the tenancy on the ground that he wants to make it available to another tenant, perhaps advertising for a new tenant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In effect these new clauses will mean that there will be more tenancies, because in a number of situations where an eligible person applies, a landlord will be prevented from selling a farm with vacant possession. I do not make too much of that, but we should have it at the back of our minds. It is only in a small proportion of cases in practice at present where a landlord puts a farm on the open market, advertising for new tenants. That is a central point and it is appropriate for me to comment on it again although it was dealt with at length on the Floor of the House.

The hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: However, we want to facilitate some progress when we reach the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basis of the hon. Gentleman's first speech, to which I shall address my comments, was that he sought to improve the new clauses so that justice is done to both sides. He really meant that he wants to tilt the balance towards the landlord but at the expense of the tenant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Winterton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not mean that unkindly. These provisions strengthen the tenant's position at the expense of the landlord in the tenant-landlord set up. The hon. Gentleman believes that they go too far and wants to move them back. His idea of social justice is not necessarily our idea of social justice. Not unnaturally, my hon. Friends take a somewhat different view of where the balance lies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnor indicated his support for the new clause, as did the hon. Member for Cardigan (Mr. Howells). We appreciate their support. To some extent it is a reflection of the importance of tenant farmers in Wales and also of the concern which both my hon. Friend and the hon. Gentleman take on this general question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend spoke specifically about the issue of the two generations succession and the average length of a tenancy. We shall have a good opportunity to go into that matter. Whatever figure we take for the average length of tenancy—and I agree with some of my hon. Friend's remarks—we must recognise that it is very much an average and that there will be some situations where the time before the two successions elapse will be much
	<span class='label label-info column'>842</span>
shorter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have addressed myself to the bulk of the remarks of the hon. Member for Buckingham on the matter of retirement. My hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, West (Dr. Phipps) also expressed some interest in this matter. I propose to comment on that on the question of adding the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, West, referred to smallholdings and the fact that the holding may not support both a son and a father. By and large it is implicit in our thinking on these matters that we legislate for this situation in which the son has been working on the holding with the father. Many hon. Members would agree that that is a situation in which the greatest injustice arises. The situation where the son has farmed or tenanted another holding is not directly analogous. It is not the same situation as that for which we legislate. I remind hon. Members that we enable the landlord to secure vacant possession of the farm, that is, to resist an application by any relative for a tenancy, if he seeks to amalgamate two farms and thus create a viable and commercial holding. I believe that by and large hon. Members accept that limitation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Howells</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In my part of the world there are many small tenant farmers with sons. Their farms are so small that the sons are unable to make a living with their fathers from the farms. Therefore, they have to go out and work. We have the Plant Breeding Station and the Ministry farms in Cardiganshire. Many of the sons of these small tenant farmers work in those establishments. Will they have the right, although they have been unable to earn their living with their father on the smallholding, to qualify as the next tenants of the smallholdings?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If they have not worked full-time on the holding, under these provisions they will not have the right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Howells</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a great pity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We can discuss this when we deal with the amendments. However, we have taken the view that the right to succeed should be qualified. Conservative Members want it to be more severely

	<span class='label label-info column'>843</span>
qualified. Certainly the intention at present is that the eligible person should have a direct involvement with the holding to the extent of having worked on it full-time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the matters raised by the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins). He referred to family rows. If the father has bequeathed the tenancy to a member of the family, the Agricultural Land Tribunal, under our provisions, will be required to give that brother or sister priority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Priority, yes, but not the exclusion of the others if they should prove that the son or the person nominated in the will is unsuitable, does not have the right qualifications or the right amount of money or experience. If another relative has put in an application I presume that the ALT can consider it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is under a misapprehension. To be eligible he or she has to fulfil certain qualifications. If those qualifications are fulfilled by more than one relative and they all appear before the Agricultural Land Tribunal the person to whom the father has willed the farm will be deemed the suitable person. I explained at a previous sitting the definition of the phrase " suitable person". That is how the new clauses are drafted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: But I am saying that when they all go to the ALT that person to whom the tenancy has been bequeathed will have to prove that he is the suitable person. If he does not prove it, I presume that the next one in the line must prove his suitability. Three or four people may have to prove it. This sort of multiple application can cause a lot of ill feeling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Stainton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that recently we put on the statute book the Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) [Lords] Act. This gives any prospective inheritor who might have been disfranchised in the will the right to challenge the will and to reopen the circumstances relating to any gift given up to five years previously. I am not familiar with the legislation but I found out about it last night because of a constituency case. I am in the course of probing the matter. It would appear to be directly
	<span class='label label-info column'>844</span>
relevant to the alleged supremacy of the will in terms of appearance before the Agricultural Land Tribunal, upon which the Parliamentary Secretary is deciding the issues as between competing ineligible relatives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point raised by the hon. Member for Sudbury and Woodbridge (Mr. Stainton). Whenever we rely on the provision that the father can will the tenancy, inevitably we raise other issues. The hon. Gentleman would be the first to acknowledge that we cannot rewrite the law on these matters in these provisions. However, I acknowledge that if what he says is true—and I have no reason to doubt him—by and large it will have implications for this situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West has grasped the position yet. The ALT will have to decide whether anyone applying is eligible. If he is eligible and he also has the tenancy willed to him, he will be the suitable person.

I agree with much of what my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Bright-side (Miss Maynard) said and with the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan). We agree about the need to facilitate the entry of new farmers into the industry. However, I hope that hon. Members recognise that as there are and have been over the years fewer and fewer tenanted farms, one of the avenues for entry which must become more important is the possibility of taking over an owner-occupied farm. I hope that when hon. Gentlemen argue for concessions which may well have the effect of making agricultural land a tax haven and thus lead to artificially inflated values for agricultural land, they will recognise that one consequence is that that it will be harder for the aspiring individual who does not have unlimited sums of capital, to become a farmer, whether he be a farm manager or a farm worker. So this argument cuts both ways.

The hon. Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body) will know that I always take his remarks very seriously and regard him as one of the most consistent members of the Opposition. He does not tell us that we should be subsidising this and that and at the same time tell us that we should reduce public sector borrow-

ing requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My basic reaction to his remarks this morning is that I am still not convinced that the provisions in these new Clauses need necessarily, or will, make life harder for his constituents. We accept his first point, and it applies in many cases where those with a very modest income, perhaps a pension, find they are not entitled to supplementary benefit, whereas an older person, perhaps living next door and with whom they are friendly, has absolutely no income and is entitled to supplementary benefit and with that entitlement certain other concessions. That is accepted. It is not affected by this clause. The retirement provision will apply only in relation to the larger holding where there is a son or near relative working on the farm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope I have assured the hon. Gentleman that my reaction to his remarks was not that I lacked sympathy with his constituent, but that I did not believe that these new clauses affected them in any way. Here we are trying to strike a balance. We believe it is right that a near relative should have a qualified right to succeed to a tenancy. Clearly, a majority of the Committee, and not just hon. Members on this side, agree. It is fair to say that there are some in the Conservative Party who have themselves accepted that this should take place. It is simply a question of the extent to which there should be a qualifying right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By and large we believe we have the balance right. That is evidenced by the fact that the National Farmers' Union supports us in this balance and has certainly not taken on this question a stance anyone could regard as inappropriate to the tenant farmer. It is evidence that we have endeavoured to strike the right balance, that the NUF has gone so far as to say we have the balance right. I hope, therefore, that hon. Members will agree to give the new clause a Second Reading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a good debate on this new clause. It has proceeded rather longer than I thought it would, but a number of matters which my hon. Friends and hon. Gentlemen on the other side have debated have been worthwhile.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must say in passing that my suggestion earlier in the debate that we might have considered an Adjournment has been justified, to a certain extent, by events. I am surprised that the Government did
	<span class='label label-info column'>846</span>
not themselves suggest that the Committee should adjourn in view of the astonishing statement we have heard this morning from the Prime Minister. What we have seen during the debate, as I predicted, was that hon. Gentlemen on the Government side were thrown into turmoil, with the only hon. Members on the other side present being the Parliamentary Secretary waiting to reply, the Minister of State, and the hon. Lady Member for Sheffield Brightside (Miss Maynard). I think you will agree, Mr. Costain, that we on this side were keeping a quorum for the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would have thought that an apology from the hon. Gentleman would have been more to the point in view of the disturbance following the announcement, which should have been made last week.

We have heard one particularly important statement from the Parliamentary Secretary, on the Government's attitude to Clauses 14 and 15. I thank him very much for that statement, which has been extremely helpful. We shall look forward to what statement he has to make when we debate, as he has promised, that new Clause 8 be added to the Bill. That will be very important and could have a major effect on the working of these new clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A great deal of sense was talked on both sides of the Committee, and I should like to take up the speech made by the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor. (Mr. Roderick) with regard to the impact of Clause 14. I believe he was implying that if that clause were to be enacted it would mean compulsory retirement from farming for the tenant. That would not be so. As I understand it, there is absolutely nothing in that clause to prevent a tenant from continuing to work on the farm and to keep a very close interest in all aspects of the business of the farm. The only thing to change would be, that the tenant would have become a near relative, and this is something worth while. I hope the hon. Gentleman now appreciates the implications of new Clause 14 a little better and will be able to look with a less jaundiced eye on the statement which the Parliamentary Secretary is to make at a future stage. These are complicated matters, and I hope that hon. Members on both sides will approach with an open mind whatever the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister of State has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hawkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make quite clear what I am sure my hon. Friend and the Minister realise, that though a farmer
	<span class='label label-info column'>848</span>
is no longer the tenant he can still remain a partner in the farming enterprise. It is simply a question of the legal relationship between tenant and landlord, and that does not affect a partnership would could easily he entered into by the farmer with his son before the farmer gives up the tenancy, as often happens where there is a tenancy of father and son and the son is hoping to inherit the tenancy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jopling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. There would be an exact reversal of what so often happens. That is what the new clauses seek to put right. After the father's retirement and the passage of the tenancy to the son there is an exact reversal of the situation, but the ex-tenant is still a full partner and abel to exert his influence much as before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My only other comment on the debate is to pick up the words of the Parliamentary Secretary in regard to the attitude of my hon. Friends towards these amendments. He said, quite reasonably, that the clause as it now stands constitutes the Government's idea of social justice. We all have our own ideas on that. I hope that when he went on to say he believed that the balance in the ney clause was right it did not mean that he is going to oppose all the suggestions and ideaswhich are enshrined in the amendments which we on this side have put down. I hope it does not mean that the Government will resist all the ideas and suggestions put forward to improve the way in which new Clause 8 will operate. I feel there are a good many ways in which the balance on which the Government have decided are wrong, and I hope that we are not to be faced by a Government who set their face totally against any amendments of any kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with immensely important matters. We have had some kind of debate this morning on how long a farm would likely to be in the hands of a landlord if these clauses were to be passed. Earlier, there was some debate on whether the term might be 90 or 100 years. I can demonstrate the situation clearly. My grandfather started farming in 1896, and moved to the farm that I myself now farm in 1906. We are now in 1976 and I, his grandson, am 45. Were I to live for another 20 years, till 65, it would then be exactly 100 years after my grandfather started farming and precisely 90 years since he came to the farm
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V003P0I0466">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>849</span>
which I now farm. My case demonstrates perfectly clearly, therefore, that in very many cases we are talking of tying up land with certain farmers for between 90 and 100 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In passing, I was astonished to hear the Parliamentary Secretary talk of the prospect of agricultural land being some kind of tax haven. This seemed an extraordinary approach to the situation, one which I find hard to understand; but perhaps we can probe that a little further during our debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope we can now move on to the amendments, which are of immense importance, and if the Government are prepared to look upon them sympathetically we shall not be forced to vote re-repetitively upon them to get some softening in the impact of these Government clauses. We shall then be able to proceed a good deal more quickly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
