	<div class='debates'>

	<section>

	<div class='legislation'>EDUCATION AND TRAINING IN WALES</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>
	<i>Resolved,</i> That the Committee do meet again this day at Four o'clock.—[
	<i>Mr. David Hunt.</i>]</p>

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ron Davies 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caerphilly)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Coleman. The subject for debate today is education and training in Wales. Since the motion was tabled there have been tumultuous events in the Welsh Office and I should like to ask you about the propriety of raising some of these matters today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will not have escaped your attention, Mr. Coleman, and it certainly has not escaped the attention of Opposition Members, that the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central (Mr. Grist) is neither in his place on the Government Front Bench nor elsewhere in the Committee. That is a matter of deep regret. I knew the hon. Member, who was the former Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales, as a political opponent but he was more than that. He was one of the most dedicated Welsh Conservatives and one of the most conscientious Welsh Office Ministers: he showed his concern for the people of Wales at all times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member was one of the nicest men in Welsh politics and I am sure that I speak for all Opposition Members when I express our deep sympathy with him for losing his job and our grave concern at the brutal way in which he was sacked. There is a suspicion that he was made a scapegoat for the Welsh Office's collective support of the right hon. Member for Henley (Mr. Heseltine) in the recent Tory leadership contest. If that is so, it puts the Secretary of State's judgment in doubt. May we refer to these matters in today's debate?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Secretary of State was instrumental in the sacking of the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central we are entitled to an explanation. What did the hon. Member do to deserve to be sacked? If the Secretary of State was not instrumental in that sacking, what did he do to protect the integrity of the Welsh Office? Why did he not stand up for his fellow Minister? If he could not stand up to the Prime Minister over the running of his Department, what confidence can we now have in him as a Secretary of State for Wales, particularly when he has alongside him a member of the loony right who was put there as a spy for the No Turning Back group?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened very carefully and I allowed the matter to run a bit because a tribute was being paid to a parliamentary colleague who is a member of the Committee. However, I must make it clear to right hon. and honourable Members that the subject before us today is extremely narrow. As a result, many of the matters raised in the point of order are not relevant and therefore do not either require an answer or further comment. As education and training in Wales is a matter of deep concern to all of us, we would best get on with the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Anderson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Swansea, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Coleman. I do not wish to question your judgment, and I do not want this to sound like a political obituary, but if we are denied this opportunity of paying tribute to our departed colleague, the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central (Mr. Grist), when will opportunities arise for paying tribute to a man whom all hon. Members found to be a most approachable Minister? I have special interest in homelessness and, because of the hon. Gentleman's knowledge of the homeless in Cardiff, he was always a good ally in that respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is beginning to trespass on other matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Anderson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, no. We want to pay tribute to the hon. Gentleman and to find out whether the Secretary of State colluded with the Prime Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must stop the hon. Gentleman. He may be paying tribute and offering laments, but I can assure him that the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central (Mr. Grist) is alive and well and a member of the Committee. In accordance with the normal practice of the House, hon. Members can refer to the hon. Gentleman in the course of their speeches, but then they must get on with debating education and training in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Several hon. Members 
	<i>rose</i>—</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Dr. Dafydd Elis Thomas, and then we must get on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Dafydd Elis Thomas 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Coleman. I welcome your willingness to permit hon. Members to pay tribute to other hon. Members who no longer attend the Committee in an official capacity. I met the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central (Mr. Grist) this morning and know that today is his birthday. I am sure that all members of the Committee will want to join me in wishing the hon. Gentleman many happy returns in the unhappy circumstances in which he now finds himself. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the hon. Gentleman was not the Minister directly responsible for education, he stood in most effectively at the Welsh Office to look after education and training when the hon. Member for Conwy (Sir W. Roberts) was unavoidably away in Baden-
Wűrttemberg and elsewhere pursuing his European policies. Ministers at the Welsh Office must confirm this morning that although an ex-teacher has now become Minister at the Welsh Office, he will not become the Minister responsible for education in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that when the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central reads the proceedings of the Committee, he will be most obliged to hon. Members for their kind remarks, but we must get on with the subject under discussion. We shall not be doing our job properly if we keep on with this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafydd Wigley 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caernarfon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Coleman. Over recent years, there has been a careful balance in the mechanisms of scrutiny of the work of the Welsh Office. This Committee is one of those mechanisms and education is a central issue for Wales. Reports in this morning's 
	<i>Western Mail</i> suggest that the other arm of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0393">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
scrutiny, the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs, will fold. That has implications for the work of this Committee, because so far there has been a balance between the two arms of scrutiny of the Welsh Office. We want a clear statement this morning confirming that the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs will continue, despite the reluctance of Conservative Members from Wales to serve on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Committee does not have the competence to answer that question, which the hon. Gentleman should put to the Leader of the House tomorrow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Rogers 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Rhondda)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Coleman. My point of order is not like the bogus ones that we have just heard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I never listen to anything that is bogus and I shall certainly stop the hon. Gentleman in his tracks if he indulges in bogusness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rogers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I withdraw the remark. My point relates to the comment made by the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Dr. Thomas) about the anxiety felt among those people in Wales with an interest in education and training about how the responsibilities will be devolved within the Welsh Office. The Secretary of State should allude to that in his speech. We who come from liberal traditions in Wales are worried about neofascist elements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That expression is not appropriate to this Committee, to educated people or to education in Wales. If the hon. Gentleman is as worried as the people of Wales about education, we should get on with the debate as soon as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rogers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Mr. Coleman, but if you term—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have ruled on the matter. The hon. Gentleman will resume his seat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rogers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not finished.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman will resume his seat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. John Marek 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wrexham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Coleman. I believe that I have a genuine point of order. I and many other hon. Members on this Committee are depressed about the treatment meted out to the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central (Mr. Grist). Is there anything in the procedure of the Committee that would enable you to call the new Under-Secretary so that he can explain why he stuck the knife in his hon. Friend's back and took the job?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gower)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Coleman. I ask for your guidance on the continuing problem of the clash between sittings of this Committee and those of the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs. On one occasion, the Secretary of State had agreed to come before the Select Committee to consider the White Paper on public expenditure. We had to postpone that sitting until after the recess because of a clash between sittings of the Welsh Grand Committee and the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs. That has happened again today, when the Select Committee was to have met the deputy chairman of
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
British Coal. Would it be possiable to know the dates of the three or four sittings each year of the Welsh Grand Committee well in advance to avoid repetition of such incidents?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Raffan 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Delyn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Coleman. I endorse the comments of the hon. Member for Gower (Mr. Wardell), who is Chairman of the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs. We had thought that we had resolved the problem so as to avoid such clashes, which happen far too often. They cause disruption to the Select Committee's work and inconvenience to the clerk and hon. Members. Those clashes are unneccesary and it should be simple to organise matters to avoid the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not quite as simple as the hon. Gentleman believes. This Committee cannot sit until a sittings motion has been passed. We are unable to give long-term advice about sittings of this Committee. I shall suggest through the usual channels that there should be more co-operation to take account of the varying interests involved so that clashes do not occur. Today's clash was unfortunate in more ways than one, but we must get on with the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.43 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. David Hunt)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>that the chairman do now report to the House that the Committee has considered the matter of education and training in Wales.</p></blockquote>
I am delighted that we are debating the important subject of education and training. I am personally grateful to you, Mr. Coleman, because I know that you made considerable changes in your itenary and engagements in order to chair our proceedings today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad to have the opportunity to debate a subject that we last debated some two-and-a-half years ago, as since then, we have made some dramatic strides. We are well on the way to having an education and training system that is responsive to the needs of the labour market, that is driven by consumer demands and that is accessible throughout life, offering recognised qualifications and clear value for money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Education and training are not just important today; they will be even more improtant in the world of tomorrow. As we debate these issues, I hope that we shall consider not just Wales or the United Kingdom, but the European Community. Many challenges and opportunities will arise with the introduction of the single European Market in 1992. There will increasingly be new job opportunities, but also greater competition, and it is essential that our young people should have the skills to enable them to compete successfully. We must look to the education service to provide them with those skills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad to be a part of a Government who have been prepared to take a radical look at education and training in this country and who have introduced the reforms needed to meet the challenges before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The education service exists not for the benefit of those who run it, but for the benefit of the consumers—children, parents and prospective employers. Parents must have the opportunities to become much more widely involved in schools than they have been in the past. I want more and more parents to become governors in schools and have a real say in what goes on. I want parents to have a wider choice of schools. I also want schools and colleges to have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0394">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
much more control over their own destiny than they have had in the past, especially in the management of resources. I want schools and colleges of which everyone in Wales can be proud. I want and education service of which teachers and everyone else connected with it can be proud. The dedication, talents and energies of our teaching force are the very rock on which the education and training service is built, and we must ensure that we support our teachers to enable them to provide the education and training needed in the 1990's and beyond.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rogers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Secretary of State for giving way and I am sure that all Opposition Members share his aspirations for the children of Wales, especially as it is our children and grandchildren who live in Wales and who use the service. The hon. Gentleman talked about his vision of the future, but where have problems arisen in the past? Those of us involved at local and other levels in the education service in Wales, both professionally and in an amateur way, find that it works very well. What is wrong with the present system?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall outline where the education service can be improved. There are no fundamental defects, but there are ways in which we can improve standards. We must never look back and be complacent. The hon. Gentleman, who has made clear his views on education in the past, is hardly one to say that he is satisfied with the present system. I hope that during the debate we shall hear from hon. Members their views on the necessary improvements to take us through the 1990s towards the year 2000 and beyond.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ynys Môn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State has said that the Government value teachers in Wales, but why are good, experienced, committed teachers applying for early retirement in record numbers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Anthony Meyer 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What ideas does my right hon. Friend have about teacher appraisal so that the better teachers may find increasing incentives and there is some pressure on unsatisfactory teachers to find a way out of the profession?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is up to teachers whether they accept early retirement. The hon. Member for Ynys Môn (Mr. Jones) will see, when I deal with the figures and statistics, that falling rolls offer teachers increasing opportunities to take early retirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite previous statements on teacher appraisal, I am reviewing the situation and shall make an announcement very shortly. I shall bear in mind the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd; North-West (Sir A. Meyer).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Clwyd 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cynon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Coleman. Is it appropriate that, while the Secretary of State for Wales is making important points about education and training, the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) is dealing noisily with his correspondence and expenses forms?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suggest that the noise from papers should be kept down a bit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: 3I have no objection to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary making copious notes of what I say. I am quite happy for anything I say to be recorded in the widest
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
possible way and, perhaps, taken down and used in evidence against me. [
	<i>Laughter.</i>] I am sure that what I am saying will provide the Opposition with no such evidence. This subject, which is very important, is in the forefront of the minds of all the people of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members have not raised this point yet, but in previous debates on education and training, they have put forward the notion that if only we were to spend more money, all the problems would disappear. I am relieved that there has been a change of policy already, without my having had to deploy many arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Money is, of course, important. However, for some years, education resources have grown in real terms, and at a time when pupil numbers have been decreasing. Current expenditure on education in Wales continues on a rising trend and is now more than £1 billion a year. Excluding school meals and milk, the increase in real terms between 1979–80 and 1988–89 was 16 per cent. That is a substantial increase. In the past five years, central Government provision for education capital has also increased in real terms by 21 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy to announce that I am informing local government in Wales that the level of gross capital expenditure granted to councils in 1991–92 should rise to £528 million. That is £53 million—or 11 per cent.—more than the equivalent amount for the current year. Full details of the distribution of resources between services and the allocation to individual authorities will be placed in the Library.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wyn Griffiths 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Secretary of State for giving us those figures. However, why, despite that increase and the wonderful record that the Minister is trying to convince us about, is the whole education sector in Wales crying out for resources? Parent governors in my constituency tell me that they are disillusioned because their meetings are so dominated by the question of how to make ends meet that there is no discussion of how education might be improved. Why is that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall answer that question, because it is one that troubles me. With so much money going into education, why do we still have defective school buildings? Why do our children still lack the books and equipment that they need? Surely the money does not simply fall into a black hole? It seems that it does, for example, £20 million a year is wasted because local education authorities in Wales have 129,000 surplus places in their schools. The problem is not so much the total amount of resources available for education as the way in which those resources have been managed over the past decade or so, during which that demographic effect has been manifest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must also tell the hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) that the assumed gross provision for education within the package that I have announce is £66.6 million. That represents an increase of 24 per cent. for next year over the comparable amount for this year. I very much hope that local authorities will use those resources for much-needed work on school buildings and the provision of essential equipment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Williams 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Swansea, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State made an interesting caveat in his explanation of the increase in resources when he said that it excluded school meals and milk. Would the increase have been smaller had
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0395">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
school meals and milk been included? The implication is that the Government have deprived children of nutrition to meet the running costs of the education system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will supply those figures later in my speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raffan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend will recall our exchange in the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs about that matter. I accept his point about surplus places, but my right hon. Friend must acknowledge that the backlog in school building maintenance is now so great that the local education authorities simply do not have sufficient resources to tackle it. In addition, the inflation rate affecting books, paper and classroom equipment is much higher than the retail prices index. He must recognise that problem, as must the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could not agree more with my hon. Friend. That is why, in response to the representations made to me by him and by other of my hon. Friends I have announced today a 24 per cent. increase in the assumed capital provision. The figure of £66.6 million is above local education authority expectations and will meet the requirements that he has highlighted. Moreover, while I take his point, the increases are substantial in real terms and will more than compensate for any differential increases in individual items.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Kim Howells 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pontypridd)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State has been very kind in giving way so often, but I wish to press him about the rough arithmetical relationship that he drew between the overall sum and the number of suplus places in schools. Does he mean that rural schools should be closed because they foul up that calculation? He will know that such schools are often at the centre of the communities that they serve and that they perform a special function in those communities. Simple, global calculations cannot be made because the cultural and social dimensions must be taken into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will know, if he looks at the statistics, that I am talking about a problem that has existed in Wales for some time. Surplus places are not found only in rural schools; they are also present in urban areas. There are justifications for rural schools. The hon. Gentleman has alluded to some of them and my hon. Friend the Minister of State has highlighted many others on previous occasions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The capital provision that I have announced today means that in the past five years, the increase for education is 75 per cent., or 43 per cent. in real terms. That is a significant increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now deal with the reorganisation of secondary education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rhodri Morgan 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I shall continue with the point that I was about to make and return later to the matter that the hon. Gentleman wishes to raise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to take this opportunity to applaud those local education authorities in Wales that are taking action—or have already done so—to reorganise the way that they provide for the education of pupils after the age of 16. There are, of course, implications here for consequential savings that the removal of surplus school places may produce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
Just as important, however, irrespective of the preferred solution, is the potential for improvement in the quality of the education provided. We should all like to see young people achieve their full potential and any improvement in staying on rates will undoubtedly be influenced by the education provision that is available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I ought to make it clear that, like my predecessor, I have no intention of dictating to local education authorities about the precise form of organisation that they ought to adopt. Those decisions should properly be taken locally after full and timely consultation with those affected, including parents, and with due regard to the prudent use of resources.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State said that local authorities could save money by getting rid of surplus places and outlined how that could be done. I want to make sure that his message goes out loud and clear. I do not want to fall foul of you, Mr. Coleman, by accusing the Secretary of State of speaking with a forked tongue, but the right hon. Gentleman knows that if a local authority—particularly one that is Labour-controlled—proposes to close a school, the Government's advice to that school is to opt out. That means that the school cannot be closed. Now the Secretary of State says that if surplus places are a big problem, schools can be closed. That means that the school must be closed completely, or half of it must be bulldozed away, or it must remain as a difficult social issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the Secretary of State advising local authorities to do? What should teachers and governors do? Are schools supposed to opt out when closure is proposed, or are they to bite the bullet and accept the decision?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I have not made a final decision on Cwmcarn and so am precluded from commenting on that situation, I should have thought that the decision on Queen's school sent a loud and clear message that, under no circumstances, am I saying to any school or to any local education authority that an easy way for a school facing closure is to opt for grant-maintained status. I made that clear when I announced the decision on Queen's school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to move on to the question of teacher supply, because I have some interesting statistics to give the Committee. I want to put the record straight on teacher supply in Wales. Quite often, gloomy descriptions are given of teacher supply problems, and in the past Opposition Members have vied with teachers' unions to produce gloomy forecasts and predictions about difficulties that lie ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In January each year, the Government undertake a detailed survey of the number of vacancies in schools in Wales. The definition of a vacancy for this survey has remained unchanged for some time and allows comparisons to be made. The survey in January this year showed a vacancy rate of 1.4 per cent. for Wales. That figufe was little changed from the figure for 1989. In September this year, my officials carried out a telephone survey of all the local education authorities in Wales to establish the position at the start of the school year. The information that those authorities provided showed that less than 0.5 per cent. of teaching posts were vacant. Although the September survey was less detailed that the January survey, it provided clear evidence that the scale of the problem in Wales at the beginning of this school year was very small.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0396">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
I have no doubt that schools and local education authorities must have worked extremely hard to fill the vacancies that have arisen during the previous year, as they do during the course of any year, and clearly they succeeded very well in finding teachers to fill the gaps. However, I assure the Committee that I am far from being complacent about the supply of teachers. I know that it is more difficult to attract teachers in some subjects than in others. Posts for science, mathematics and modern languages are in short supply. The Government recognises that, which is why students studying to become teachers of those subjects are given a bursuary of £1,500, or £2,000 in the case of physics, as an incentive to take up teaching as a career. We have also introduced a great deal of flexibility into the pay arrangements for teachers, so as to allow schools and local authorities to offer incentives to attract and retain teachers in subjects where recruitment is most difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Wales, the introduction of the national curriculum will have a major influence on demand for teachers of Welsh. We hope to complete and publish projections of teacher demand under the national curriculum before long. however, it is quite clear that we shall need a significantly greater number of teachers who can teach Welsh as a language. We have already taken action in that respect by adding Welsh to the list of subjects for which bursaries are paid to student teachers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We welcome the decision to include the teaching of Welsh as a language in the national curriculum and warmly endorse the legislative framework, but I have two questions to ask. First, is the Secretary of State satisfied that, over the next five years, there will be enough resources to meet those objectives? Secondly, will he say more about his decision to allow some schools not to teach Welsh as part of the national curriculum beyond the fourth form?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In-service training is an essential part of the picture and we are investing heavily in it. It is essential to provide training for the teachers that we already have to enable them to learn Welsh and to teach the language. Many existing teachers are Welsh speakers who do not teach the language at present. Many others are not Welsh speakers at the moment, but with training will make an increasingly valuable contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This year we have arranged for £1 million to be made available for training for Welsh language teachers. I can announce a 50 per cent. increase of that sum to £1·5 million for 1991–92. What I find encouraging is the number of teachers who are enthusiastic about learning the language and about training to teach it. this, more than anything else, augers well for the future of our Welsh language policy for schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I cannot give the guarantee that the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Dr. Thomas) seeks, I hope that I have convinced him that the Minister of State and I are determined to take every possible opportunity to ensure that there will be enough teachers of Welsh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the hon. Gentleman's second point, I have already announced the exemptions. I am involved in consultations and my hon. Friend the Minister of State can amplify any further points raised in the debate on that subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Livsey 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brecon and Radnor)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State's remarks are encouraging but the report by Her Majesty's Inspectorate, entitled "Review of Eductional Provision in Wales 1988–89" highlights a problem in the teaching of Welsh. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In many schools between one quarter and one third of the staff teaching Welsh as a second language do not have a specialist qualification in the subject."</p></blockquote>
Does the Secretary of State believe that the additional resources that he mentioned this morning will cope with training up to one third of staff who are inadequately trained to teach Welsh?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, those resources will help in the way that the hon. Member has outlined, but we shall keep the situation under careful review.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wardell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State is still a little complacent about teacher supply. A high proportion of modern languages and science teachers have no qualifications beyond A-level, sometimes even beyond O-level. How closely is the Secretary of State examining that problem? How many people in Wales are on those bursaries?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had outlined aspects in which I want to see improvement. I said that I was far from complacent about the present situation. I shall supply the detailed statistics that the hon. Gentleman has requested, but I do not want to give the impression that I am satisfied that we have achieved our goal. There is more to be done and we are determined to do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the changes taking place in the education system at the moment impose strains on those who have to implement them. It is perfectly understandable that teachers feel apprehensive about the changes and how they will cope while the changes are being introduced. However, no one should make the mistake of believing that teaching is no longer an attractive profession. The facts speak for themselves. For instance, despite the earlier suggestion that there has been an exodus of teachers from the profession, the turnover in the profession has remained stable in recent years at about 8 per cent. It is particularly encouraging that the profession has an increasing attraction for students.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can announce today that at the start of this academic year the number of students enrolling on initial teacher training courses in the public sector institutions in Wales has increased by 12 per cent.—from 1,025 in 1989 to 1,149. I shall be happy to supply a more detailed breakdown for hon. Members should they wish it. That is an encouraging overall picture which gives me confidence that the measures we have taken to attract students to the teaching profession are working. We will continue to monitor the position closely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: How do the figures for initial teacher training compare with those for the postgraduate certificate in education? I understand that the latter have fallen drastically over the last few years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The increase for primary courses is 11 per cent. and for secondary 17 per cent. The education departments of the university have recruited at about the same level as last year in primary courses. There has been a reduction in recruitment to secondary courses which may well be due to recent reorganisation, of teacher training in the university.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0397">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
I still believe that the overall picture is encouraging. We shall do our best to monitor the position closely to ensure that we have sufficient teachers to meet the needs of our children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now refer to the national curriculum. We are very concerned with what is taught. The Government have taken an historic step forward with the introduction of the national curriculum. Its time was due and almost everyone supported it in principle, and we have now moved far beyond that general principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much of the practical reality is now coming into effect and schools in Wales are working vigorously to implement the next stages. The structure of the national curriculum is becoming familiar and well accepted. I was interested, for example, familiar and well accepted. I was interested, for example, when we consulted recently about flexibility within the national curriculum for 14 to 16-year-olds, to find that great support was expressed for the principle of the following all the foundation subjects right through from 5 to 16. That is not entirely surprising. The national curriculum is not something that has been imposed on teachers. Teachers have been closely involved at every stage of its development. We are fortunate in Wales that our communication lines with the profession are short. We have been able to consult teachers at every stage, and we have made a point of doing so. We have listened to what we have been told and we have responded. We have been fortunate that many busy and able teachers have given generously of their time to help us with this work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that requires resources. We are putting more than £2·5 million into support for the national curriculum through education support grant this year. That has been backed up by £8·5 million of funding for in-service training of teachers within which national curriculum training has priority. More than £1 million of Welsh Office funding has gone to the School Examination and Assessment Council to prepare assessment materials and guidance in English and Welsh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are putting £1·25 million into the Curriculum Council for Wales, of which almost £500,000 goes specifically on development of support for teachers. Section 21 grants for the Welsh Language amounting to £2·8 million have gone to projects supporting the national curriculum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have endeavoured to give way to members of the Committee, and had intended to deal extensively with parental choice. However, I should like to leave that subject to my hon. Friend the Minister of State to deal with, and members of the Committee may raise points on it if they wish. I should now like to deal with higher education and training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have under consideration important recommendations from independent consultants on the future of the Polytechnic of Wales which have implications for the other institutions of higher education in the local authority sector. The recommendations call for the most careful consideration to establish the right framework for higher education in the 1990s, a framework that will encourage more students to enter higher education and encourage the growth of transbinary co-operation between the university and public sectors. My hon. Friend the Minister of State has completed the consultations needed to establish the views of authorities and institutions. I shall listen carefully to any points raised by hon. Members and hope to make an announcement shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
The White Paper "Employment for the 1990s" published in 1988 described the labour market of the coming decade as one of increasingly rapid change—demographic change, technological change, changing market opportunities and changing skill requirements. In that climate, it is vital for the future prosperity of our country to have strong and effective liaison between education and industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Important to the success of every company and, ultimately, the economy, is its work force. Business wants a work force that is well qualified and well motivated. It is no one's interest, least of all the young people concerned, for pupils to leave education without qualifications or prospects. Business has an impotent role to play in helping to shape young people's attitudes towards work by establishing links with local educational establishments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the climate of a reduced labour market, companies will find that they have an edge over competitors in recruitment if they have good contacts with local schools and colleges.

There has been good progress over recent years. A statistical survey just published shows that 96 per cent. of maintained and independent secondary schools have links with industry. Further, the indications are that the volume and diversity of those links have increased in recent years. Half the schools concerned had staff seconded to industry—about 500 teachers in total; 47 per cent. of schools were involved in curriculum activities with industry, and 41 per cent. were involved in joint problem-solving activities. Also, 93 per cent. of schools will be increasing their links. That is all very encouraging.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that for Britain or for Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> It is for Wales, as we are dealing particularly with Wales. I do not believe that the statistics are as favourable for England, but, if the hon. Member for Newport, East (Mr. Hughes) wishes, I can supply him with details.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been concern that this has all been one-way traffic with schools, rather than industry, taking the lead. However, I am encouraged that, of late, industry has realised that it has to be more involved. We are seeing increasing evidence of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been a wealth of initiatives. The Government have funded the enterprises and education initiative, under which advisers have been appointed to each county area with the specific aim of bringing together education and industry. Wales was quick to participate in the Government's technical and vocational education initiative that has done so much to improve the relevance of education of 14 to 18-year-olds in schools and colleges. Clwyd began its pilot scheme as long ago as 1983.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Roy Hughes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot quite reconcile with reality the rather glossy picture painted by the Secretary of State of the Government's attitude to education and training. I wish to bring to his attention the case of an engineering student from Alway in Newport who is attending Queen Mary and Westfield college, University of London. The Universities Funding Council has said that the college is £2·3 million over budget, with the result that it has been pressured into cutting its engineering establishment. If the Government were serious about their commitment to skill training, they would not countenance such cuts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a matter for my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Science. I would have taken full responsibility had the student been involved in higher education in Wales, but the hon. Gentleman must pursue the matter elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All Welsh local education authorities had pilot schemes that I have described in place by 1985 and were extending the scheme to all schools and colleges by 1989.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Compacts have been another exciting development aimed at providing young people with the opportunity to achieve their full potential at school, in college and in training and to prepare them for their working lives. Wales already has three operating compacts in South Glamorgan, Mid Glamorgan and Clwyd, and another is being developed in West Glamorgan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are giving those compacts up to £50,000 each for their development, and up to £100,000 in each of the first four years of their operation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State will know that I have been very interested in the allocation of compacts in the counties of Wales for some time. So far, only four compacts have been allocated to the largely urban counties, and none to the rural counties. Will there be an announcement soon about further compact scheme initiatives in the rural counties?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am anxious that the scheme should be extended throughout Wales. I am at present considering a bid and shall bear in mind the hon. Gentleman's remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am keen to complete my contribution, but I am equally keen to give sufficient priority to training. The revolutionary new framework for training and enterprise is going extremely well in Wales. All seven training and enterprise councils in Wales have now entered the development phase. Three are already fully operational and the remaining four will join them in the new year. We are now on course for completing the network in Wales a full two years ahead of schedule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Llanelli)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State say something about the future relationship between ET training schemes and TECs? There is considerable unease among training managers in south-west Wales that, although they have not yet heard what their budget will be for the next financial year, they are being forced to draw up their contracts and give details of the bids that they are likely to make. They are extremely worried that the TECs might shut them out or reduce their scope for operation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The concept is revolutionary in that it requires the training and enterprise council in an area to put forward a local plan for training. That plan must be published, and widespread consultation undertaken. A number of TECs are at present developing their plans. That will require consultations with all the different bodies involved to put together a total package.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I did not make my anxiety clear. The managers of the ET schemes still have to place their bids for next year, but they have not yet been given the information that they need.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall look into the point that the right hon. Gentleman has raised. However, I hope that the TECs will know their budgets before long, because it is important for them to have that information. They will get it within the
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
next few days so that they can plan properly for next year. Much has been made of alleged cuts, but TECs will have more money next year than they are likely to spend this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
TECs will be a tremendous success in Wales. Following the latest announcement, they will have much more freedom and flexibility to adapt the existing training and enterprise provision and design new approaches to meet local needs. I have had discussions with the chairmen of all the TECs, who emphasised the need for greater flexibility. The flexibility that has been announced is a direct result of the pressure that they exerted on me. The TECs will have important new responsibilities. We announced recently that responsibility for the current employment department budget for work-related further education will be transferred to TECs from April next year. Work-related further education is designed to ensure that public sector provision of vocational education and training is more responsive to employment needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am confident that TECs in Wales will provide another stimulus to the further education system to make it more relevant to the world of work, more responsive to the needs of employers and students and more flexible and accessible to adults as well as to young people. By giving TECs a wider role in education in other ways—for example, as part of their business plans for next year they will be able to bid for additional resources to launch or extend education and business partnerships—we shall ensure that education institutions and industry are brought even closer together.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wardell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for what the Secretary of State says about the training and enterprise councils. When I lunch later today with the First Sea Lord, I shall discuss with him the high-quality training that I have seen this year in the armed forces parliamentary scheme in which I have been participating with the Royal Navy. I have visited establishments such as the engineering school at HMS Sultan. How confident is the Secretary of State that the quality of training in the new TECs can be brought up to the quality that young people in the armed forces are receiving, so that the resources that go into training for peace are at least as great as those that go into training for war?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has made an important contribution. A great deal of what I have said relates not so much to the quantity as to the quality of training. When I first became Secretary of State, I identified training as a top priority in looking to the future of Wales. As I have travelled up and down the Principality, I have been confirmed in my belief that we must put an additional focus on training. I assure the Committee that my commitment to the quality of training in Wales is as firm and steady as it has ever been.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The progress that we have made in training and the reforms of the education system provide the framework within which all young people can develop their talents and skills. As I am sure that other hon. Members will confirm, that is to the benefit not just of those young people, but of all the people of Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Question is—[

	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Jones 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Alyn and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells) will begin his highly readable Sunday article by referring to the remark made by my hon. Friend the Member for Gower (Mr. Wardell) about having lunch with the First Sea Lord. That was quite an intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I bring you, Mr. Coleman, apologies from my hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore (Mr. Powell) who regrets that he is unable to take his place and make his customary point of order. His health is improving.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note the care and sensitivity with which the Minister of State, the hon. Member for Conwy (Sir W. Roberts), handles the important matter of the Welsh language. He is doing his best to get the issue right. He has good advisors in his Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State should have said that he would make more school visits—he has made only one formal visit. I wanted to hear that he would meet individual teachers' unions, to brief himself on the views of the profession, and parent teachers associations in Wales. It would be helpful if he were to make an overdue visit to the National Library.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He made no reference to pressing matters such as truancy, the occasional school violence, solvent alcohol and abuse, vandalism and the incidence of smoking. Those issues are not all-important, but are increasingly gaining the attention of those who deal with the school service. The Secretary of State should have taken some interest, however passing, in those problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State may admit that school music, especially the teaching of musical instruments, is under pressure. The peripatetic school music teacher is under threat. My contacts with the profession have shown me that physical education teachers believe that their prospects are fewer and fewer as pressures mount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State did not refer to the place of and prospects for female pupils in Welsh schools—a glaring omission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State began his remarks by referring to Europe. Recommendation 1137 of the Council of Europe, in paragraph 2 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Policy-makers, parents and students should have access to independent and internationally comparable means of assessing educational courses, schools and national systems of education."</p></blockquote>
If the Secretary of State wants a European view, I offer him that up-to-date information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Secretary of State attempted to deal with training. He did not show how he would advance the prospects for women in Welsh training. He took no special view of the interests and needs of the disabled. Opposition members are often contacted by the disabled in Wales, who have strong views. The Secretary of State should consider that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must enhance the schools service and extend skills training. The Secretary of State knows that after 1992, Wales will face a veritable gale of competition. There is no gainsaying that our competitors have invested more effectively than we in their schools service and skills training. We must continue to enhance our attractiveness
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
to inward investment. If we are to remain competitive in that sphere, investment in our schools service and in skills training is a priority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not the most effective way to develop training in Wales be to transfer responsibility for training wholly to the Welsh Office rather than having it split between the Department of Employment and the Welsh Office?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not give my views on that, not out of discourtesy to a cogent intervention, but because I do not make policy on the hoof.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want the industries of Wales to have a secure future into the next century. The Secretary of State's proposals did not convince me that the Government have had a strategy. He will agree that above all else, we want for our school leavers real jobs that last into the next century and pay well. The autumn statement shows that the Government's response to the skills challenge is to cut training in Britain by £500 million over the next two years. That decision will inevitably affect training in Wales. No matter how much the right hon. Gentleman seeks to mask it with fine words, that is a major blow to our interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two out of five trainees completing the youth training scheme in Wales obtain no qualifications. Some 20 per cent. of those finishing youth training become unemployed. The number of trainees in manufacturing and engineering fell dramatically during the 1980s, partly as a result of the massive recession in the early 1980s. The number of trainees in manufacturing industry has fallen by more than half since 1981, when there were 7,900 in Wales; in 1988 there were only 3,600. So much for the Conservative record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The picture for engineering trainees is equally grim. The number of craft trainees in Wales has fallen by over 65 per cent. since 1979. Those figures come from the engineering training board. The right hon. Gentleman tried to gild his remarks on training. He talked about initiatives and advances that were good for Wales, but all the figures point in the opposite direction. While Conservative administrations have had power, our skills base has been ground down so much that we now have almost an emergency. Nothing that the right hon. Gentleman said today has in any way assured us that the Government have any plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman said that he had good news on money and the schools service, but only half of our children have nursery schooling. Two out of three children leave school at 16 years of age.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Minister of State, Welsh Office (Sir Wyn Roberts)</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wardell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Member for Carmarthen (Mr. Williams) says, it is a Labour-controlled authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat that there is tremendous variation in nursery school provision. If the figure is only 70 per cent. throughout Wales but is 97 per cent. in West Glamorgan, I hate to think about the prospects for some children of nursery school age.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is well informed, as is my hon. Friend the Member for Carmarthen (Mr. Williams).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the top 24 local authority providers of nursery schooling are Labour-controlled authorities. The Committee should pay tribute to local education authorities in Wales for their fine contribution to nursery schooling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Spending today represents a smaller proportion of the national income than it did 11 years ago. It is now 4.8 per cent. compared to 5.5 per cent. Therein lies the response to the Secretary of State's speech. He has given us the gross capital expenditure but, to give greater relevance to our deliberations, why did not the right hon. Gentleman give copies of his statement to every member of the Committee? I wager that that information has been given to the media in the Palace of Westminster. [
	<i>Interuption.</i>] I understand that it has not. It would have been helpful if the right hon. Gentleman had thought fit to give the Committee the figures when he made his statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had arranged to give the hon. Gentleman figures before this sitting. If he did not receive them, I hope that he will accept my apologies. The figures are in the Library and I shall arrange to release them to the media later today. Spending on education is a small part of the announcement, but I felt it wise to alert the hon. Gentleman to all the detailed figures before this meeting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to remind the Secretary of State of the backlog in the maintenance of the schools service throughout Wales. Local education authorities in Wales have collated information that shows that Gwent has a maintenance backlog of more than £14 million. Mid Glamorgan has a massive £24 Million; Powis one of £5 million, South Glamorgan one of £25 million and West Glamorgan one of £28 million. I believe that the maintenance backlog figure for Gwynedd is more than £15 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one can say that that can be put right immediately, but maintenance of the fabric of our schools puts into context the Secretary of State's announcement today. However well he thinks that he is doing, he must do better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
The Secretary of State did not refer to stress among teachers, although I do not criticise him for that. A newspaper report of a Health and Safety Executive document, published as recently as 16th November, states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Rowdy pupils, aggressive parents and classroom stress are leaving serious mental and physical scars on teachers".</p></blockquote>
According to the HSE, which is an impartial body, some 30 per cent. of teaching staff could be suffering from a wide variety of less serious complaints.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How are Ministers responding to the clear evidence that teachers are suffering from these problems? What initiatives might they take? The Secretary of State knows that the schools inspectorate recently published a report which stated that a third of the teachers of English in Welsh schools have no specialist qualifications to teach the subject. Furthermore, that under-qualified or non-qualified third who do not have a relevant degree in English or education, often come from other subject areas such as drama, modern languages or music.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cite those two examples simply to illustrate that although the Secretary of State has responded as helpfully as he could to questions raised in the debate, there is evidence that he does not fully comprehend the challenge facing the schools service in Wales today. It would not be an exaggeration to say that education in Wales has declined to a state that is nothing short of a scandal. That is a bold statement but it was made in a leading article in the 
	<i>Western Mail</i> of 7 February 1990. The article concluded:
	<br><blockquote><p>"What is needed first is a change of policy on education funding, with high priorities for staff salaries and continued training, books, equipment and buildings".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr David Hunt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are not many of these matters longstanding problems? When the Labour party was in office, spending on education fell by £1.6 billion or almost one percentage point as a proportion of GNP, and teachers' pay rose by only 6 per cent. Therefore could the hon. Member put his remarks in a wider context?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The right hon. Gentleman is wrong. I have already spoken about the proportion of the national budget in 1979 compared with that in 1988. That is fact. I also have to remind him that his Government have held power for an uninterrupted period of over 11 years. The problems are his problems. His Government have had one great boon that no previous British Government have enjoyed—access to North Sea oil revenue, amounting to at least £87 billion since 1979. What have they done with it? Why should a Conservative paper like the 
	<i>Western Mail</i> state in a leading article:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Education in Wales has fallen into a state of backwardness that is nothing short of a scandal"?</p></blockquote>
Why should a Conservative newspaper ask that after his Government and his ministerial colleagues have had responsibility for our schools service for over 11 years? It is a scandal and the right hon. Gentleman and his Minister of State carry the responsibility for the defects that we now know exist in our schools service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To help the right hon. Gentleman, to enable him to brief himself and to read into the subject I have gone to distinguished head teachers in Wales. They gave me some information that they asked me to impart to Ministers at the Welsh Office. One head teacher sent me a detailed briefing, the first heading of which is "Assessment and Record Keeping". I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will sit up straight, listen carefully and take notes. The headteacher says:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0401">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"The new requirements are a major source of frustration amongst teachers…It is very time-consuming and involves the teacher working for quite long periods with individuals and/or small groups of children whilst also trying to educate the rest of the class. This is indeed very difficult with 5–7 year olds."</p></blockquote>
My informant, and the right hon. Government's adviser, is a primary infants head teacher of distinction. She continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Teachers feel that these children are missing out on valuable teacher contact time as a direct result of the amount of time being spent on assessment. Additional staffing would help but there in no cash to pay for extra teachers."</p></blockquote>
The Secretary of State mentioned in-service training of teachers. This head teacher says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Given the enormity of change in the educational system …all teachers need considerable retraining. Insufficient time has been made available for staff to date. Teachers are reluctant to leave their classrooms to go on courses because of the pressures which the National Curriculum and assessment has imposed. Much of it has to be done after school."</p></blockquote>
Preparation of work and extra curricular activities has to be undertaken also. She concludes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"More time should have been allowed to train teachers properly to cope."</p></blockquote>
The head teacher makes interesting remarks on capitation, but I want to quote what she says about buildings:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Large sums of money need to be spent on the building to keep it in good repair. Our school has had no internal redecoration since it opened fourteen years ago… Very shortly under Local Management of schools these will be the responsibility of the school Governing Body. Matters such as this are a source of great concern amongst the Governors."</p></blockquote>
Let me draw to the attention of the Secretary of State the head teacher's remarks on charging policy:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Government legislation re-charges for school activities has made it difficult for teachers to arrange theatre visits and other educational visits. Our school now pays for some school outings and for the cost of the baths entry fee through the Parents Association so it is still the parents who pay in the end or the children who miss out."</p></blockquote>
On privatised school services she says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Other essential staff at the school find their jobs under threat through competitive tendering for the services that they perfom. Schools do not know who will be cleaning the school from 1st January 1991. Existing cleaners who have served the school loyally and helped to mould its image in the community could find themselves cast to one side."</p></blockquote>
On LMS she says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As a head teacher who is trying to prepare for the introduction of LMS in April 1991 I am aware that regardless of the school roll the funding which the LEA can allocate to my or any other school is largely dependent on the fiscal policies of Central Government."</p></blockquote>
At the end of her remarks she says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I would like to add that where state schools are delivering quality education it is achieved through the ingenuity of Governors, school staffs and parents."</p></blockquote>
That is a genuine, reasonable and, I believe, accurate response from an important school level—infants and primary. It comes from a distinguished head teacher who is utterly devoted to her school, admired by parents and governors and much loved by the children. From my experience, I know that what I have just reported could apply to any school in any LEA. I am defining a serious problem. Parents with youngsters at school in Wales are anxious. Nothing that the Secretary of State has said today has assuaged our wories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To help the Secretary of State, I decided to seek advice from the highly qualified head teacher of a successful high school in Wales. He told me that morale is low, that recent media reports are less than truthful about commitment and quality, that teachers are overburdened by the volume of recent legislation and that they are concerned that, as usual,
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
they will be expected to pick up the pieces and make the recent reforms viable. He went on to ask how LEAs will fund the urgent repair and capital building programmes now needed for schools built in the 1960's. It is not difficult to imagine the generally poor state of buildings in the near future and the effect that that will have on teacher morale. I have already alluded to the problems faced by the LEAs in connection with the many schools built before 1903, and I made specific reference to the valley communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Time is of the essence, so I shall follow the Secretary of State's example and curtail my remarks. I shall say only that the people of Wales understand that their schools service has not been well cared for by the Conservative Government. Social justice demands that the problems are put right. I make a commitment that a Labour Government will tackle those problems as a matter of urgency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central (Mr. Grist) for the superb way in which he carried out his duties in the House, in the Welsh Office and in the Principality, where he won the admiration of everyone with whom he worked. The news of his dismissal has tarnished one corner of the bright image that Conservative Members have formed of our new Prime Minister. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said that he recommended that change. That is a greater tribute to his loyalty to the Prime Minister than to his veracity. My hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) will not find it easy to win acceptance in Wales. I am sure that he will be the first to recognise that to do so, he must switch his undoubted abilities and energies away from guarding the sacred flame of party ideology to doing what he can in his new office to contribute in practical ways to improving the lot of the people of Wales—all the people of Wales. I have no doubt of his ability to achieve that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the Committee's difficulties is to decide whether education and training are social services. If we decide that they are, we are talking about the rights of everyone to free and unrestricted access, subject only to necessary limitations of public expenditure. If, however, we decide that they are investments in the nation's future, the arguments will be based solely on value for money, although they will take a rather longer-term view of profitability than is current in financial institutions in the City of London. Both education and, more especially, training, might benefit from being treated as investments rather than as social services, but in reality we have to apply a mix of the two definitions.

I should be the first to defend the system of universal state education for all and to plead for the necessary resources from public funds. In my constituency, as in the constituencies of all other Members, there are schools in a dilapidated state, shortages of school books, occasional shortages of teachers and classes that are too large. However, when I go round the schools in my constituency, as I do regularly, my overwhelming impression is not the gloomy picture painted by the hon. Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mr. Jones). It is of a dedicated corps of teachers doing a first class job in premises that are occasionally shabby but, on the whole satisfactory, and of pupils who take an interest in their work and a pride in their school.

I am quite ready to acknowledge that even in a good education authority such as Clwyd, there is still a waste of resources in some cases. There is plenty of room for the introduction of more business-like methods. There is always scope for closer co-operation with local business and industry, although in that respect some schools in my constituency have been outstanding in their achievements. I am conscious that this rosy picture may look very different in other, less prosperous areas. Nevertheless, I am proud of all the schools in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case for secondary reorganisation seems to have been established. Whatever may be said in favour of the case for keeping open small, rural primary schools—that is based more on social than educational reasons—it seems absurd that secondary schools that are relatively close to each other should have empty places and insufficient skilled teachers for specialist studies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was glad to hear my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales give the firm assurance that the provisions for opting out of local authority control will not be allowed to be used as a means of frustrating proposals for secondary reorganisation in the introduction of tertiary colleges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the careful improvement in relations between the Government and the teaching profession, which was begun by my right hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South (Mr. MacGregor) when he was Secretary of State for Education and Science, will continue under his successor, my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), who has a reputation for being a bit of a bruiser. However, I have no doubt of my right hon. and learned Friend's total commitment to the principle of state education of a very high standard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pray that the teachers' unions will not repeat the folly of the industrial action that did such great and lasting harm to the reputation of the teaching profession. I know that teachers have had to carry an unreasonably heavy burden, particularly as a consequence of the recent veritable avalanche of changes in education policy and systems. However, they would have attracted more sympathy if they had concentrated on pointing out the practical problems instead of giving rise to suspicions that they were using those changes as a pretext for industrial action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might seem that training, as opposed to education, is, without dispute, a matter of investment policy rather than social policy. Pretty well everyone is agreed that our training provision has lagged behind that of many of our rivals especially Germany, and that it is a cause of our industrial lack of competitiveness. I hope that we are going to see the Government using all the fiscal incentives and penalties that they can devise to push employers into raising training standards and provision. There has been progress in recent years, but there have been such a
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
bewildering number of changes in the system and in the nomenclature that dark suspicions have developed that one of the objects of policy is to dress up the unemployment statistics. I am quite satisfied that that is not so, but I am equally sure that we are a long way from having what is, and is seen to be, a system of training that compares with that of Germany.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some aspects of training do not fit so readily into the category of investment yielding a material return, even in the long run. I refer to the training of disabled people, especially the mentally handicapped. Here I must express some concern. There has been the scrapping of the community programme. I readily admit that it was often pretty unsatisfactory, with a lot of people hanging about doing precious little to acquire skills. However, the programme enabled all sorts of people, to find something more useful to do than sitting on a public bench all day and it brought a lot of help and cheer to old people. It would have been valuable if that programme had been in operation during the disastrous floods in my constituency in February, when people's gardens were ruined by salt water and sewage. If it had been possible to call on the community programme to help people to clear up the mess, to dig over and replant gardens, it would have been a powerful morale booster. The voluntary organisations stepped nobly into the breaches but the community programme would have been a real help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the programme was uneconomic and had to go, but I have been somewhat concerned by the pleas that I have received from training agencies working with those who have special needs or with the mentally handicapped. They are not getting the resources that they need to provide training for people who may not be able to earn their living on the open market or contribute much to the creation of national wealth but for whom the dignity of a job is available only if they can acquire a basic skill. I have not been reassured by the replies that I have received on this point from the Secretary of State for Employment. Whether education and training are social services or investment, there is no doubt that they are at the forefront of national debate, and rightly so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: As on other occasions, I agree with much of what the hon. Member for Clwyd, North-West (Sir A. Meyer) has said, especially in his opening remarks. It is important for Opposition Members to have good relationships with Ministers. I found that the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central (Mr. Grist) was accessible and willing to listen to matters that I raised with him. The role of the Secretary of State in the affair is mystifying. If it was an act of loyalty to support the Prime Minister's decision, we could understand it. If, as he has claimed, he is responsible, it is an appalling misjudgment of the mood and character of the Principality and of its ministerial needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the hon. Member for Clwyd, North-West I think that we should all be anxious about success in our education and training system. I suspect that, since I entered the House nearly 25 years ago, every Parliament has had an Education Reform Act of some kind. Not for the want of legislating have we failed to create an education and training system that meets the needs of our society.

My hon. Friend the Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mr. Jones) raised many important issues, including nursery education. I went to school and learned to read at the age of three. In parts of my constituency there is no nursery provision. Is that progress, 40 years later? Similarly, at junior school I was taught by a brilliant teacher, who, because of the deprivation and the lack of educational opportunities in the 1930s, was the only member of his family who could go to college. He went to Caerleon training college. Half an age later he would be a professor of English. We must worry about the status and qualifications of junior school teachers. Our junior teachers deserve better. They should not be the Cinderellas in the system. It is in junior school that children are turned off or on to education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Alyn and Deeside gave some horrifying figures about the deskilling of our communities over the past decade. In my community in the past year or two we have tried with Government initiatives to repair some of the damage done in the first half of the past decade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the new education reforms will compound our problems in some ways, because they are based on a false diagnosis of what is required and what has gone wrong. I suspect that I am not in step with my Front Bench, but I shall no doubt find out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's proposals have failed. They failed to identify the changes that were required in education for the 14-plus age group. The Government's proposals to introduce a common, uniform national curriculum through to the age of 16 will compound those problems. We need a school-leaving examination at 16 and a curriculum that reflects the different aptitudes, abilities and interests of those in secondary schools, which are not the same, but a uniform national curriculum leading to a common examination will be imposed. Two staggering facts, adding to those given by my hon. Friend the Member for Alyn and Deeside, show the failure of that system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, more than half the school-leavers in Wales leave school with GCSE grades of less than C in core and foundation subjects. Whether or not we like it, our society is elitist and meritocratic by nature, especially in education. Neither parents nor employers recognise a GCSE qualification below grade C. That is a fact of educational life in the communities that I represent. More that half our children leave school with less than a C grade qualification in a clutch of important subjects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, in the 16 to 19-year-old group, 78 per cent. take on jobs without being offered training. The Secretary of State referred to the European context. In Germany, 94 per cent. of 16 to 19-year-olds already have a training qualification or go into jobs that offer training. We have failed to create a meaningful relationship between the 14-plus education system and the outside world. I wholeheartedly support education and industry links, but there has been a failure to develop the post-14 education system to meet the different aptitudes and needs of our 14 to 16-year-olds. The Education Reform Act 1988 compounds that problem by imposing a common, uniform national curriculum up to the age of 16.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the summer recess, I was pondering those issues and examined the system in Europe and the United States. I do not think that the Americans have too much to teach us, so I shall not develop that argument. My right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition understandably has
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
been attracted by the French baccalaureat system. I am not sure whether that system is exportable, but some of the principles and ideas of German secondary education are exportable. I am not talking about the proliferation of different types of schools. Those schools offer a diversity of secondary school education, especially from age 14 onwards. Within the comprehensive system, we could have technical, practical, business and commerce through to old-fashioned academic subjects from the ages of 14 to 16 that would not lead to a common uniform school-leaving examination, which has caused the problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is GCSE system into which everyone is funnelled. We have had to devise means and methods of diluting that system to try to get some results. Even then the results are not effective, as I described. Why is it that in post-war Britain—unlike Germany—we have failed to create a school-leaving qualification that is not tied to old-fashioned academic subjects, which I enjoyed and which might suit my daughter and sons, but does not suit the many teenagers in our schools? Why have we not developed a technical school leaving qualification that is recognised by society, parents and employers? That key issue has not been mentioned by the Secretary of State or in education reforms introduced by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our first priority should be to establish an alternative, technical and practical school leaving qualification that will be recognised by parents, employers and society as of worth in itself. It should also be the building block for a compulsory post-16-year-old training scheme and system. The German system is virtually compulsory and 94 per cent. of 16-year-olds-plus go on to other forms of vocational educational training. Many of the kids in my area—even with the youth training scheme and so on—leave school and go to jobs with no prospect of training. That will fundamentally mortgage our future. Even those in training can, at best, expect to get a national vocational qualification level 2, which is about GCSE C grade if we are trying to find an equivalent current school qualification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that no one will accuse me of making a plea for lowering standards but what the new education reform system has not recognised is that children have different aptitudes, abilities and interests. My daughter is useless at physics and chemistry but she can play the flute, dance, read, is fascinated by the world, and is a future member of the chattering classes, which means that she will follow her father in that respect. There is no need for her to be pushed into the TVEI training approach to education for the 14-plus. I have had 18 months of correspondence with a shcool administrator arguing this issue. The TVEI training at 14-plus is one positive thing that the Government have done. It financed a major reform that transformed part of our secondary schools to do active, enjoyable and meaningful work but I do not understand how that can be squeezed into the national curriculum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notion that a group of children may want lessons in the classics was passionately opposed—not a single lesson is taught in classics in Merthyr. If children want to study art and history and perhaps take a different approach, why should they be uniformly bunched into a common school examination system between 14 and 16 in a national curriculum? The Government were wrong to create that fundamental problem, which has been a feature of our education system in recent years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree, but I do not see how that squares in the national curriculum, because it will be taken through to 16 and funnelled into a common GCSE subject. TVEI introduced new aspects to secondary school education but why did we not follow the logic through and develop a school leaving certificate that would mean something to parents, employers and society and reflect that vocational educational training perception? We have gone back on that as a result of the national curriculum notions of assessments and attainments that were spawned by the Education Reform Act 1988. That is my basic complaint.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nothing that I have said denies the value of assessment. The question is what we assess, what we are trying to develop and what kind of educational system we provide. It is common ground that children must be assessed, but I am complaining bitterly about the notion of assessing all children at 16 as a result of a common curriculum and a common school-leaving examination system. I believe that there is room for alternatives to reflect the diversity of aptitude in our secondary school children, particularly 14-plus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a worrying trend, which is evident also in Germany—we should not always paint a rosy picture of Germany. My right hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli (Mr. Davies) kindly drew to my attention an article in the "German Tribune" about the growing crisis in vocational education in Germany, where fewer students are now seeking vocational education. It will be a feature of mature post-industrial societies that people lose interest in making things and using their hands, as well as pursuing academic or commercial educational opportunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may be old-fashioned, but we must ensure that our educational system and the training system attached to it develop the skills needed in a society in which people will want to make things with their hands and to manufacture, as much as to think, write, read and, in my case, talk.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I welcome this debate. My mother was a teacher for 25 years, I was a lecturer for 14 years, albeit on a police constable's salary, and my three children have gone through the comprehensive education system in Wales, so I have some experience of education in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the British association meeting in Swansea received the address of Sir Claus Moser, it was a major breakthrough for education and its importance to Wales in
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
the past decade. Sir Claus said that education costs money—so does ignorance. We must measure education proposals against that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The history of education in Wales is not happy. We try to quantify the problems. Schools have been underfunded and teachers have been undervalued, which has seriously affected morale and the ability to transmit wisdom to young people at an extremely receptive age. Regrettably, there has been less pre-school education in Wales than in other areas. The figure of 70 per cent. was quoted earlier, but that includes part-time pre-school education, and I am speaking of full-time pre-school education. More pupils in Wales leave school without any qualifications, which is a sad indictment. There are moves to put those matters right, but our history is not good and that is very sad for a country with a rich tradition of education. In recent years we have lost our way. We have a lower proportion of young people in higher education than any similar society. That is an indictment not only of the past eleven and a half years of Tory rule in Wales but of what happened under previous Labour Governments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My sources of information are "Statistics of Education in Wales 1989" and DES Bulletins 1990. They give the figures for the participation of 16 to 19-year-olds in education in various nations. The figure for the United States of America is 79 per cent., for Japan 77 per cent., for France 66 per cent. and for West Germany 47 per cent. That highlights what the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr Rowlands) said about the situation in West Germany not being all that it is cracked up to be. The figure for participation of 16 to 19-year-olds in full-time education and training in Wales is 36 per cent. That sad state of affairs must be put right, regardless of what political party is in power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay due credit to the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney who tackled the problems in a radical way, which is what is required. We must have variety and not be too constricted by a national curriculum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider training as a separate issue. It is of paramount importance for young people to acquire more skills. As I said, our participation rates are lower than those of other countries. We must make every effort to provide quality skill training, something that is done inadequately. The role of training and enterprise councils is important in that respect. The involvement of employers means that we are going almost full circle in training. Apprenticeships used to be the order of the day several decades ago. They provided good skills training. There were weaknesses in that apprentices were not always adequately rewarded for their training, but they were certainly well trained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is significant that TECs will now co-operate with local education authorities and further education colleges. That was stated in the past six months, but it should have been so all along. I believe that there have been artificial barriers between the FE and training sectors. They should share knowledge and work together towards the common objective of full trained 19-year-olds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a question mark over the security of TEC funding. Government contributions will reduce over time, so will employers pick up the bill for TEC training? Employers' attitudes need to change in this respect; their ethos should be what it previously was, when they were prepared to pick up the bill, to involve themselves in, and to devote resources to, training. There is a big question mark about whether they will do so in Wales. Employers in other
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0405">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
countries are prepared to do so, especially in West Germany where they make a large commitment in funding towards training. That factor combined with threatened Treasury cuts—the Secretary of State for Employment had problems when trying to persuade the Treasury in the last spending round to provide sufficient expenditure for training—is a warning light.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must consider links with further and higher education on sandwich courses. Those courses are extremely important and I was intimately involved with them for 14 years before coming to the House. Sandwich courses provide skill training, and allow a keying-in with further and higher education. It is extremely important that people are both skilled and properly educated. The courses that I was involved with at the Welsh Agricultural college produced, after four years, someone who was well-trained, could do a job and could respond flexibly to the needs of society. The threatened cuts are a pathetic response, given that participation rates are still only just over 30 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the training boards have been phased out. however, I was pleased to be with the Secretary of State for Wales last week when he visited the Royal Welsh showground at Builth Wells for the opening of the new agricultural training board centre there. Clearly the agricultural training board has a worthwhile future in Wales. I was delighted about the amount of decentralisation of power. More power will be given to the agricultural training boards in Wales, and skill training within Welsh-speaking areas will be an important aspect of training young agriculturalists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must ask whether secondary education in Wales adequately prepares young people for the challenges of life. Clearly, it cannot be doing so. A 1989 document from Her Majesty's inspectorate in Wales states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In one LEA, for example, some 40 per cent. of English staff have at least, at best, modest qualifications, subsidiary level or lower in English. These teachers undertake about one sixth of the teaching. In another, 21 per cent. of mathematics teachers have no specialist qualifictions in the subject."</p></blockquote>
I have already referred to the fact that up to one third of teachers are not adequately qualified in the Welsh language where Welsh is a second language, taught in secondary schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The concept of surplus school places, especially at those in rural areas, should be attacked. I was pleased to hear the Secretary of State say that he was prepared to allow local education authorities to pursue their own objectives in their own areas. There are immense problems in sparsely populated areas—I refer especially to Powys. It is no good talking about surplus school places, when up to 30 village schools have been closed in Powys in the past 25 years. The school transport budget in Powys is now that of the central administration of the education authority. That is an extraordinary state of affairs, but it shows what can happen when schools are closed as a result of following a mistaken policy to its absolute, illogical end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One needs to put a shot across the bows of the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett), the new Under-Secretary. I have heard him say many times that surplus school places are a major problem. Some parts of Wales are so sparsely populated that children of five and six have round trips to their primary schools of 24 miles a day in the sort of weather that is just starting. that is serious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The LMS funding formula is somewhat suspect in that it penalises schools that have well-qualified and experienced staff. The high school in Brecon has recently lost four of its
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
most senior staff because of LMS funding. That has damaged the school status almost irretrievably. It happened because schools are given money sufficient only to pay average teacher's wages. The formula does not take account of experienced teachers. That also applies to many primary schools. Formula funding within LMS must be revised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The national curriculum, which has already been mentioned, is not broad enough. The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney said much about the inadequacies of the national curriculum, although I would not go as far as he did in saying that it was too narrow. We must get the basic subjects right, but it must also be broad enough to encompass many other activities that children with different abilities should be able to pursue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State said little about school opt-outs. Now that he has had his backbone stiffened by the hon. Member for Pembroke, he will be constantly reminded about them. Only two Welsh schools have opted out, both in the difficult circumstances of being threatened by closure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency, the John Beddoes School in Presteigne put forward opt-out proposals. Happily, we campaigned against them and the parents voted against opting out by two to one. The Secretary of State should congratulate Powys county council, which is now prepared to put capital of £900,000 into that school to update buildings and improve provision. That is a vote of confidence in the vote of confidence that the parents of John Beddoes school gave to their local education authority. That school will improve within the local education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must put pupils first. It is the right of all individuals to develop their talents to the full. We must improve teacher morale and training. The best way to achieve that is to ensure that teachers receive better pay. I know from personal experience that it has been inadequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must achieve a consensus on giving the national curriculum a broader framework. LMS formula funding must be reviewed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is important work to be done on Welsh language provision. I was glad to hear the Secretary of State promise more funding for that. The Welsh language is under tremendous pressure, not least in Welsh-speaking areas. It is vital to support education in the medium of Welsh and bilingual education because it is important that our children have the opportunity to utilise the language from an early age—starting in the ysgol feithrin, as my own children did, in Welsh-speaking areas. Children must have the opportunity of bilingual education up the age of 16. Many children who have gone through the primary sector use Welsh well, but do not continue to use it after reaching the age of 11 and lose the ability to speak the language.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regret the absence of the hon. Member for Carmarthen (Mr. Williams), but I will not attack him in his absence. Instead, I throw him down a challenge, which he can pick up when he reads our proceedings. The highest proportion of Welsh speakers in the hon. Gentleman's constituency is in Dinefwr in Dyfed, and in my constituency it is in the area of Sennybridge and Llanwrtyd. There is now a good case for a bilingual school, at Llandovery or Sennybridge, where the Welsh language travels from one education authority area to another from Dyfed to Powys and where it needs to be strengthened.

I hope that the hon. Gentleman will support me in campaigning for a bilingual school in the area where Powys and Dyfed cross, as that will strengthen the Welsh language there. An important aspect of that will be the continuation of the superb grounding in the Welsh language in primary schools in Dyfed and Powys.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Like the new Prime Minister—I suspect that this will be the only comparison that I shall ever make with him—I did not enjoy school much, at least until the fifth form when, I suspect unlike the Prime Minister, I discovered that half of my school mates were female. That tended to change matters and I decided to stay on as school was a good place to meet females. School children's priorities may well be different from those that we have heard about this morning. For example, if their school buildings fell down tomorrow, I suspect that half of them would not care. Indeed, they would probably rejoice in the streets. However, it is our duty to ensure that they do not fall down.

I want to draw attention to the state of schools in the jurisdiction of Mid Glamorgan county council. That matter has been aired before, but it needs reiteration because the schools there are in the most deplorable state. Part of the reason for that are the peculiar problems that the people have experienced for many years. Those have as much to do with the area's industrial history and topography as with the policies of successive Governments. In any mining area, there is subsidence and Mid Glamorgan county education authority spends £1 million a year on filling in voids underneath schools. It spends almost £1 million a year on shoring up the walls, which prevent the schools from slipping down valley sides. Those are large expenditures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For may years, the authority has made representations regarding the capital allocations determined by the Welsh Office and approved for all county services. The inability to proceed with replacement schools, which might not suffer such problems, has met with an inadequate response. As a result of those problems, there are many temporary classrooms throughout the county. They are expensive to maintain and should be replaced with permanent accommodation. The Welsh school in Rhydyfelin in my constituency is suffering dreadfully as a result of such problems and that example can be duplicated throughout Wales. Unfortunately, the inadequate capital building programme allocations have not allowed authorities to proceed with the replacements that they need.

Indeed, Mid Glamorgan education authority currently spends £10 million a year on repairs and maintenance. It is one of the highest-spending local education authorities in the repairs and maintenance league table in the United Kingdom. The bulk of the annual expenditure is used to try
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
to ensure "safe, watertight and warm" conditions for children, so comparatively little can be spent on other maintenance items, such as redecoration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The director of land and buildings in Mid Glamorgan says that at a rough estimate at least £25 million will be required in addition to the annual expenditure of £10 million to bring schools up to an acceptable standard. That estimate will be updated and submitted to the Welsh Office, which should consider it carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1988 the Audit Commission published a document entitled "Local Authority Property—A Management Overview". That publication refers to the scale of the backlog in maintenance requirements, and says of it:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This is a problem which will grow over the next decade. Not only is there a large existing backlog of maintenance, there is also a 'time bomb' ticking away as the components of the buildings erected in the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s begin to wear out."</p></blockquote>
The report goes on to say that
	<br><blockquote><p>"even in the absence of an existing backlog, the maintenance bill for schools will rise inexorably for years to come."</p></blockquote>
Mid Glamorgan has a huge backlog and many problems are yet to come.

Special education in schools is another severe problem. I am sure that the Secretary of State would have mentioned it if he had had more time. There are many problems in meeting the demands of children with severe learning difficulties, whether it be dyslexia or a physiological problem. Constituents complain that such facilities are not available. When I pass on the complaint to education authorities, they say that they would dearly love to provide the facilities but cannot do so because they have no funds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend refer specifically to the desperate need for speech therapy in several schools and to the way that the professional career structure and pay does not reflect the Government view of market forces? If the pay structure were market-led, speech therapists would be paid far more than they are now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is important. In my constituency the Llwyncrwm school in Beddau desperately needs a speech therapist. The provision of physiotherapy facilities in large comprehensives is a vital component of our education system. Now that the national curriculum is in place, there is little spare time for teaching.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a child needs physiotherapy, it must be transported to a hospital for treatment, with the result that he, in the meantime, misses lessons. Because of the tight schedules of the national curriculum, that child cannot make up those lessons. We are wasting the potential of those children, and that grieves me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Junior departments in schools, in particular, are desperately short of remedial teachers. In a superb speech, my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) spoke about his daughter's musical ability—she is a marvellous flautist. The chances of children becoming marvellous flautists will decrease because the number of peripatetic music teachers is declining. The chances that children have to benefit from their advice and teaching will diminish accordingly. That is dreadful for a country which, whether justified or not, has long rested on its laurels as the land of music and song.

The Secretary of State briefly mentioned the pivotal role of the polytechnic of Wales, which is in my constituency and for which I have tremendous admiration. It has gone
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0407">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
through an enormously difficult period over the past two years and it is not out of it yet. I want to make a special plea for the polytechnic of Wales. It runs some of the most progressive, brave and experimental courses of any polytechnic or institution of higher education in Britain. I recently visited its computer department and saw the most incredible overcrowding and lack of equipment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State has quite properly been travelling the world trying to get investment into Wales. He knows full well that after 1992 we will face the full blast of competition from Europe. Much will hinge on whether we can provide work forces, school leavers, university and polytechnic graduates who are properly qualified to take on an increasingly technical and mathematical role. I am worried about the factories in south Wales such as those in the electronics industry which employ many hundreds of people. Few of their employees have degrees or the qualifications that we need to ensure some security for their future in Wales or the direction that they take.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must carefully consider the future of the polytechnic and I hope that the Secretary of State will place it high in his priorities. According to the recent HMI report on polytechnic and college computing departments in England, a department of the size of the computer department at the polytechnic should have a budget of between £221,000 and £363,000 for capital and revenue. Its budget last year was £145,000, and this year will be £137,000. Those are serious deficits in something as state of the art as computer technology.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A comparison of departmental work stations reveals more serious shortfalls. The recommended number of sophisticated work stations for a polytechnic with a department of this size is 70. The figure in Pontypridd is 23. The recommended figure for the middle range of work stations is 70. The polytechnic of Wales comes closer there as it has 64 but the recommended figure for low-cost work stations is 70 and it has only 16. If we do nothing else with the polytechnic of Wales—and I hope we do a lot more besides—we must ensure that that department is properly funded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Rogers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for being absent earlier, but I had some other meetings that I could not avoid. I should like to reinforce my hon. Friend's plea to the Secretary of State for the polytechnic of Wales. For seven years, I was chairman of the governors and we received enormous support from the local authority, particularly from Mid Glamorgan county council, which is the most under-resourced authority in Wales. A tremendous amount of money from Mid Glamorgan and the old county of Glamorgan was poured into the polytechnic of Wales. It occupies a unique position in the history of Welsh education. It started as the Glamorgan school of mines, and for many of us from mining villages in the valleys it was a goal to which most of our school friends aspired. It is fully integrated into the education system in Mid Glamorgan and, unlike any other polytechnic, is part of the community. I therefore reinforce the plea made by my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells) for more resources to be made available to the polytechnic. The Welsh working class see it as a special institution, and it needs help and support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Dr. Howells</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for reinforcing my point. I hope that the Secretary of State will take on board the fact that that institution occupies a pivotal role in Welsh higher education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should appreciate some guidance about the way in which formula-funding works in junior schools. I am afraid the many new parent-governors are not clear about that. A school of 210 pupils is divided by 30, and that is deemed to be the appropriate size of a class. If my feeble mathematics is correct, seven teachers should be allocated to that school. One could, of course, argue about the optimum size of a class. The problem is that such schools, like the one attended by my six-year-old son, there may be 25, 28 or 29 children on school rolls. That does not qualify the school for an additional teacher because it has not reached the stipulated 30 children per class. The organisation of teaching in that school is disrupted. In my son's class which has, I think, 37 children there are three age categories. That throws out the whole system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What does the Secretary of State propose to do about that? Examining teacher shortages and vacancies is not the most important point; we should consider the quality of teaching in classrooms. That often depends on the ratio of teachers and on simple matters such as age splits in classes. I fear that such problems are having a detrimental effect on junior education in Wales, and I hope that the Secretary of State will take them seriously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to express my anxiety about the manner in which the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central (Mr. Grist) departed from office. I always found him to be an amiable and personable hon. Member, who was always courteous to delegations that came to meet him. The Secretary of State should tell the Welsh people whether he sought the changes in his ministerial team or whether they were foisted upon him.

Our topic today is rightly at the top of the political agenda. The amount of investment in education determines the priorities that we place on the work people of tomorrow, and our skills determine our nation's industrial and economic performance. Our investment in young people determines the type of society that we shall create. It is important for us to make a clean breast and to admit that our poor economic performance, our mismatch of skills and our low industrial output has much to do with the lack of investment in education and training.

Efforts have been made recently to raise education standards in the state sector, largely through the Educaiton Reform Act 1988. Unfortunately, in large measure, the efforts have failed, principally because teachers have low morale, which has reached rock bottom.

Last week I met young primary school head teachers from my constituency to discuss that matter. They complained of low morale among head teachers and their colleagues. Their complaint—which I tried to convey to the Secretary of State earlier—was that experienced, committed and conscientious teachers were queueing up to apply for early retirement. I accept the Secretary of State's view that teachers have the opportunity to apply for early
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
retirement. However, it is not bad teachers who apply for it but conscientious teachers, who feel that they cannot make the contribution to the education system that they made 10 or 15 years ago. The changes that have been forced upon—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
