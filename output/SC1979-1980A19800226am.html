	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we start on the first amendment, I should apologise to right hon. and hon. Members for the shortage of Amendment Papers this morning. There has been some difficulty at the printers. A limited number is available at the moment and more are being photocopied, so I hope that, before we go much further with our proceedings, copies will be available for those right hon. Members and hon. Members who do not now have them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 77, in page 7, line 13, at end add
	<br><blockquote><p>"but it shall be for the employer to prove that he acted reasonably."</p></blockquote>
I hope that I may be allowed to preface my argument on the amendment with some concern, yet again, about the way in which the Committee is being treated by the Government. We have had occasion to protest about the discussions that are taking place outside the Committee about the Government's legislative changes on industrial relations and relations between employers and trade unions and workers. Last week, the Under-Secretary of State—whether deliberately or not is beyond my ken—told us of pending changes in the rules governing the conduct of industrial tribunals, a matter which is closely relevant to our immediate discussions, and we had yet again the spectacle of the Prime Minister discussing on television last evening—and widely reported in the newspapers this morning—possible further changes of a most dramatic and far-reaching nature which could have serious consequences for industrial relations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not the way to treat a Committee of the House of Commons. A friend of mine, a professional in industrial relations matters, sought my advice last week on
	<span class='label label-info column'>646</span>
certain questions, and he said that he would attend the Committee during the course of its proceedings so that he might be better informed about the changes that the Government are making. I advise him that perhaps he ought to read the newspapers—and, in the light of experience during the last 24 hours, perhaps he ought to watch television as well—rather than concern himself with what is going on in the Committee, since it seems that we are very much an off-stage affair, carrying out rehearsals behind the scenes while somebody else is making the real decisions elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the amendment. Last week, I pointed out that the changes that the Government now propose in clause 5 seek to take the law right back to what it was in the infamous Industrial Relations Act. We all know the consequences of that Act. I pointed out, indeed, that clause 5 worsens the position because of the insertion of the provision which we debated last Thursday, and I do not wish to revert to that debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Government have said that many of the changes that they propose in the Bill arise from representations made over a long period, I cannot recall any representations. I should be glad to hear from the Under-Secretary of the representations that have been made on the question of the shifting of the onus of proof.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I checked back when this matter was last referred to in the House. We debated industrial tribunals on 21 November 1977. I read the 
	<i>Hansard</i>report of our proceedings then, and there was merely a passing reference from one hon. Member, who—I say this with no disrespect to him—no matter what distinction he may have achieved in other matters, has never acquired a particular reputation in these. There was hardly any reference then. I should like to know what justification there is for the change. The onus is on the Government to make out their case for change rather than for us to make out the case for our amendment. None the less, I shall make the case for the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First—this has been said repeatedly by Ministers and others—when an applicant goes before the tribunal to complain that he or she has been unfairly dismissed, the only person who knows why the dismissal has taken place is the employer. That is why the legislation has long required the employer to go to the tribunal and establish that he has, in his opinion and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0850">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>647</span>
within the law, fairly dismissed the applicant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only on Sunday evening a constituent who had been dismissed came to seek my advice. His experience illustrates as well as any that springs to mind why the employer should have to make out a case before the tribunal. His name is Arthur Boughey, and he is employed by a firm called Solar Tubes in Doncaster. It has not been organised by trade unions for a long time. It has existed in my constituency without, to the best of my knowledge, any trade union organisation. In January this year the workers, expecting what they have come to expect—an annual pay increase—were disappointed when it did not take place. They approached the boss and asked "What about a pay increase?" After some difficulty and persuasion, he gave them an increase of several pounds and then deducted their bonus, which was about twice or three times the amount of the increase that he had given them on their basic pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not unnaturally, the workers protested. The most vociferous of the protesters was Mr. Arthur Boughey. The employer dismissed him instantly and ushered him off the premises. He told him that the reason for his dismissal was redundancy. Manifestly, in the circumstances, redundancy was the least likely reason. My constituent can assume and we can assume the real reason for his dismissal, but he does not know officially what it is. He has not been given, as is required by the Employment Protection Act, written notice of the reason for his dismissal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary may say that such a man can go to a tribunal and demand that the employer give him written notice of the reason for his dismissal. But there would be a time-consuming interval, and if he were to go to the tribunal with his claim of unfair dismissal and say that he had not been given the written notice, the tribunal might well say—as it ought—"That is a matter for concern or reproach and we could order the employer, but that is not the issue before us. The application is about unfair dismissal." The Under-Secretary would have it that that individual should have to make out a case showing why he had been unfairly dismissed. But he does not know. He can assume or reasonably guess, but he does not know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me round off that little saga. It is
	<span class='label label-info column'>648</span>
relevant to our present and future discussions. When Mr. Boughey was dismissed, 13 of his workmates immediately went on strike to protest against that unfair dismissal. They were instantly dismissed also. Then they went to join a trade union. The trade union accepted them into membership and sought to represent them with that employer. The employer refused to receive the trade union and has made clear that he will not receive or recognise any trade union. So we have here all the makings of another unhappy Grunwick situation—a mini-Grunwick.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Arthur Boughey does not know officially why he has been dismissed. He does not know the facts. In this case, because the Government changed the law relating to the period of employment that a worker must serve before he can submit a claim to the tribunal and this individual had worked for the firm for 51 weeks, apparently he is to be denied his chance to go to the tribunal—except that in this case the employer did not give him the requisite notice required by law. I was therefore able to advise my constituent to make his application to the tribunal and point out that, had he been served the notice, he would have got his 12 months' qualifying period. But we are almost at the end of February, and these unhappy events occurred at the beginning of January, so he is running perilously near to exhausting his time, and he still does not know the reason for his dismissal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the case again and again. Equally, as in that example, very often the reason given by the employer is not the real or full reason for the dismissal. Let us assume that the employee has been dismissed for bad time keeping. It is not sufficient to say that he knows all the reasons for his dismissal when the employer, in compliance with his statutory obligations, gives the applicant a piece of paper which says "The reason for your dismissal is bad time keeping." What that employee is entitled to know is whether he has been fairly or unfairly selected for dismissal for bad time keeping. He may be a bad time keeper, but 90 per cent, of the employees may be even worse time keepers, in which case he would fairly have the right to expect that, if people were to be dismissed in pursuit of the proper disciplines required to maintain punctuality and good time keeping, he
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0851">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>649</span>
should not be unfairly chosen and discriminated against. One could give many other examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are familiar with the protestations in the past that the employer, contrary to the principles underlying British justice, is having to prove his innocence whereas natural justice requires that it is his guilt that should be proven by the other party. But what is too often overlooked is that, when the proceedings come to the tribunal stage, the employee has already been the victim of an arbitrary action by an employer, without any chance to defend himself at that stage. He is the person who has automatically, often without words in his defence, been declared guilty by the employer, and when it gets to the tribunal it is then a case of an appeal by an individual against an arbitrary act which may have the most far-reaching consequences for his whole career and life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last week I quoted from the Royal Commission report showing how Lord Donovan and his colleagues saw the serious consequences of dismissal for a worker. First, it deprives him of a livelihood—the livelihood not only of himself but of his family. Moreover, it often deprives a man of his self-respect. It can be destructive in terms of his career. It can be demoralising. It can leave a scar that lasts throughout his life. It is a very serious matter to which it is reasonable to expect an employer to be required to give serious consideration, and part of that consideration must be the likelihood that he will have to explain his actions in an industrial tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Oddly enough, no one ever seems to challenge the fact that the Redundancy Payments Act lays the obligation fairly and squarely on the employer in redundancy cases to prove that he has dismissed his employee because of redundancy. No one seems to question that the onus of proof in that case should lie on the employer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make one final point. I am not and never have been in the ranks of those who say that the law has no role in industrial relations. I recognise, pay tribute to and support the voluntarist principle in industrial relations. Equally, I believe that the more we can keep the law out of involvement in industrial relations the better. But I recognise also that there must be statutory protections, statutory safeguards and rights for individual
	<span class='label label-info column'>650</span>
workers, not only to protect them as individuals and to give them the rights that they properly deserve but also because I believe that in this area the law can make a positive contribution to improvement in industrial relations and help to keep industrial peace.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Gorst</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the right hon. Gentleman not arguing that one should have one's cake and eat it? Surely, if there are to be statutory protections there ought to be statutory protections for employers as well, and these are clearly not there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not challenge that. I do not want to get involved in that argument at this stage; I think that we shall be debating it later. I do not think that the hon. Gentleman was listening carefully, because I was referring to statutory rights and safeguards for individual workers. I was speaking about individual workers. I referred to the Redundancy Payments Act, and I gave that as an example of how the law can play a positive, useful and constructive role in helping to keep industrial peace. I recall that in my days as a shop steward long ago, because we did not have the Redundancy Payments Act then, when an employer declared a person or a group of people redundant and we felt that this was unjustified, very often the only remedy was to take some form of industrial action in defence of one's fellow-worker or workmates. That is no longer the case. The Redundancy Payments Act has diminished the need for that considerably and we have relatively few disputes these days about redundancies or compensation for redundancies. The law has helped. Such action has not disappeared entirely, but the law has been enormously beneficial on the matter of redundancies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Likewise, I think that the law on unfair dismissal has made a useful contribution. In the days to which I referred, if a workmate was unfairly dismissed, or, at any rate, if his workmates felt that he was unfairly dismissed, they could not question whether the dismissal was unfair. Nowadays, the remedy is there, through the statutory procedure. Instead of his mates having to take industrial action, the chap can go to the tribunal and obtain justice there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. and learned Gentleman makes that process more difficult, if he
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0852">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>651</span>
creates a situation where there is a diminution of confidence in the tribunals and a lack of confidence in a person's ability to get justice from the industrial tribunals, there may well be a tendency for people to seek redress by other means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to go over the case of Mr. Robinson, but that is an example of people not feeling sufficiently confident in the industrial tribunal and seeking to take other action. It turned out a different way, but I would hope that workers would have sufficient confidence in the statutory machinery for the peaceful redress of grievances, and that they would use it, instead of feeling it necessary to resort to industrial action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman will realise that this is not just a question of law. It is a question of human relations and industrial relations. I hope that the Committee's primary concern will be to do what it can to maintain and improve good relations—this is the purpose of our proceedings—rather than get itself tied up in these legal aridities and changes on such matters as this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stan Crowther</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend has made out an unanswerable case and there is little that I wish to add. I wish merely to stress the extreme importance of the matter we are debating. Clause 5 is a short clause and the amendment also is short, but no provision in the Bill is of more far-reaching importance to individuals. We are not talking here about someone being expelled from a golf club, for example, from a dramatic society, or even from the Tower Hamlets total abstinence club. We are talking about the loss of a person's livelihood, which is the most important thing in anyone's life. Nothing can be more serious, and it seems to me that there is a concrete case made out for requiring the person who takes the action to justify it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a basic principle of natural justice in any circumstance, and particularly in these circumstances when the man losing his job will, as my right hon. Friend pointed out, see the standard of life of his wife and his family brought down, apart from the effect on himself. Surely, the Government cannot resist this amendment. I am astonished they did not write it into the clause themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If anyone takes any action which grossly damages the interests of someone else, the
	<span class='label label-info column'>652</span>
onus must be on the person taking the action to show that he was acting in a proper and justified way. We hear from time to time of the Conservative Party's concern for the rights of the individual, yet once again, as we have seen previously in this Committee, a Conservative Government are taking away the rights of the individual or seeking to restrict them unreasonably and in such a way that they are unable to secure their rights, as my right hon. Friend has explained. Only the person who has taken the action in dismissing the individual has all the facts within his own knowledge anyway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing I wish to add. The case is totally made out, and I look forward to hearing from the Under-Secretary that the Government will either accept—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends have frequently used the analogy of membership of a club. Will he accept that he is arguing from a fallacy? A work force is not a democratic institution. It is a group of people who happen to be employed by the same employer. They have entered into a contract with him, not with a trade union. Surely, it follows that it is unreasonable to exclude a minority. To take the argument to an extreme form, if one were seeking to exclude a number of black people or women, for example, it would be a clear form of discrimination. It would be totally unacceptable to hon. Gentlemen. Why is it acceptable to exclude a certain class of people who do not wish to belong to a union?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am more convinced than ever now—I was pretty sure during his earlier intervention—that the hon. Gentleman is looking at the wrong clause. We are now debating an amendment to clause 5 which is intended to require the employer to prove that he acted reasonably in dismissing an employee. That has nothing to do with exclusion or expulsion from a trade union. We are talking about contracts and the ending of the contract between employer and employee. Since it is the employer in these circumstances who has ended the contract by dismissing the employee, we say that he should be required to show that he acted reasonably in so doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that is now clear to the Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst). If he had listened more carefully to what
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0853">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>653</span>
my right hon. Friend said, he would be in less difficulty now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a very clear issue. If I take action which seriously damages the interests of another, I should expect to be called upon to justify it. It is as simple as that. I cannot anticipate how the Government will justify opposing it, and I hope that the Under-Secretary will say that the Government see the merit of our argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ron Leighton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> 
	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I shall be forgiven for forestalling the hon. Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton), because I think that it will be for the convenience of the Committee if I explain the effect of the clause 5 and the reason why the Government think it right to resist the amendment. I can agree with a great deal of what the right hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) said. Of course, we understand the desirability of moving behind the stark terms of a contract of employment relating to notice and the importance of providing a measure of job security by legislation over and above what the contract provides. That is why in the 1971 Industrial Relations Act, brought in by a Conservative Government, the concept of unfair dismissal was introduced into our law for the first time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I am entitled to take up the somewhat repetitive reference to the "infamous" Act of 1971 in this context and to point out in a gentle way that it was the infamous Act of 1971 that, for the first time in our law, conferred upon workers a measure of job security over and above that which either the common law or their contracts provided in the form of notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I absolutely agree with what the right hon. Gentleman said as to justification for that major change in our employment law. Broadly speaking, he said that it was the employer who knows best the facts that led to the dismissal and it would be inequitable to apply the strict burden of the common law standard and burden of proof that he who alleges must prove—since here the employer has the advantage and is in the best position. That was the basis for the 1971 Act, and it remains the basis for the legislation which is now incorporated into the Employment Pro-
	<span class='label label-info column'>654</span>
tection Act. Although TULRA 1974 began with the resounding declaration that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Industrial Relations Act 1971 is hereby repealed"</p></blockquote>
the Labour Government were careful to retain by subsequent legislation—perhaps not so resoundingly proclaimed—the unfair dismissal provisions of that Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the right hon. Gentleman has unwittingly misled himself into supposing that clause 5 reverses the burden of proof. That is not so. All that an employee has to do in order to establish a claim for compensation for unfair dismissal is to show that he has been dismissed, and that he has worked for the minimum qualifying period. Thereafter, the burden shifts to the employer, and the employer has first to show the reason for dismissal, and then that that reason is one of the four "OK reasons"—justifiable reasons—set out in section 57(2) of the 1978 Act, or that it was for some other substantial reason for which he can give evidence. Under the existing legislation which clause 5 bears upon, and only bears upon, the employer must go on to show that he acted reasonably in treating that OK reason as grounds for dismissing the employee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is only that last limb that clause 5 bears upon. If the clause is enacted, the burden will still remain on the employer to show the reason for the dismissal, It will still remain upon him to show that it was an OK reason. The burden will not shift to the employee to show that the employer acted reasonably in relying upon that OK reason as ground for dismissing him. It will be, as it were, in the middle. The tribunal will have to satisfy itself whether the employer acted reasonably. That is all that clause 5 will achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, if I may say so, the right hon. Gentleman read too much into the clause. His argument would have been appropriate to a clause which shifted the whole burden of proof on all those limbs to the employee, but it is not appropriate to the circumstances that I have described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth bearing in mind that the concept of unfair dismissal is, so far as I am aware, unique to our system of enforceable rights and obligations. Apart from the Redundancy Payments Act, with which it goes pretty closely in harness, there is no other legislation which confers enforceable rights upon a claimant which, so soon as the claim is made, are awarded
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0854">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>655</span>
unless the respondent to that claim discharges the burden of proving relevant matters. I do not complain of that, because, as I said at the outset, the circumstances of a contract of employment are such as to warrant that reversal of the ordinary rule of our law. That is why the Conservative Government thought it right that that should be enacted in the 1971 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1974 the new Labour Government enacted that it should be for the employer to prove that he acted reasonably—in other words, that the employer should shoulder the burden of the third limb now set out in section 57. The tribunal had previously to say "We have looked at the evidence and the employer has established"—or has not—"the reason for the dismissal. He has established that it was one of the four OK reasons." Now, the tribunal has to see whether the employer acted reasonably. Under the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974, the new Government said that the burden of proof should be on the employer in that respect also.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether in those days that was regarded as a legal aridity, to use the right hon. Gentleman's expression. Presumably, it was not. But I agree with what he said. We are all concerned with establishing and underpinning good industrial relations. But the Government are concerned also with increasing the opportunities for employment. We believe that in terms of law the clause will have little effect but in terms of psychology it will have a significant effect. We believe that in 1974, in putting the burden of proof expressly on the employer to show that he acted reasonably in regarding the OK ground that he established as a reasonable ground for dismissing the worker, the Act went too far.

It is hardly surprising that the legislative package as a whole can be seen as providing that to sack someone, for whatever reason, is to be guilty of unfairness until one has proved oneself innocent. None of us can be surprised that this legislative package, now incorporated in section 57 of the 1978 Act, can be regarded in that way, and so great a departure from our ordinary principles does not make people want to hurry to become employers; nor does it win friends for the important concept of unfair dismissal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have said enough to assure
	<span class='label label-info column'>656</span>
the Committee that the Government regard the concept of unfair dismissal as important and are as much behind it in 1980 as their Conservative predecessors were in 1971 when they introduced it. But clause 5 serves only to revert to the position which we thought it right to introduce in 1971 in this regard. We are not putting the burden of proof as to whether a dismissal was reasonable on to the employee, but we are leaving it in the middle so that the tribunal looks at the whole of the evidence.

To round off what I said a moment ago, in practice it will not make much difference to the legal burden—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why put it in then?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolute rubbish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be, but the hon. Gentleman's castigation of it as absolute rubbish would carry a little more weight if he had heard the opening of the argument. He was, unfortunately, unable to be with us until a little later. If I may, I shall expand upon it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the clause goes on the statute book as it is at present, the employer will recognise that the tribunal still has to satisfy itself that he acted reasonably, and it will be up to him, if he uses his common sense, to bring forward evidence to show that he acted reasonably. If he does not bring forward evidence based on this part of section 57 and if he cannot base any argument on evidence which is before the tribunal, he is clearly in a precarious and uncertain position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practice, therefore, any employer who is at the sharp end of a claim for compensation for unfair dismissal will know that he should put before the tribunal any evidence that is available to him upon which the tribunal can come to the conclusion. that he acted reasonably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Naturally, this argument prompts the question "Why do it?". The answer is that the legislative package as a whole, as it has remained since 1974, can readily be seen by prospective employers as amounting to this: if anybody makes a claim against the employer for unfair dismissal, the employer is guilty right

	<span class='label label-info column'>657</span>
down the line unless he proves himself innocent. That may well be expected to frighten people off.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Giles Radice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: "No", says the hon. Gentleman. I was asked about this by the right hon. Member for Doncaster, and I can tell him that we have had about 150 individual communications to the Department on the unfair dismissal provisions. Practically all the organisations formally consulted supported this change, and it is one which must be looked at in terms of psychology as well as in terms of legal burden. If the legal burden were to be placed back on to the worker right across the board so that he had to establish all three limbs, that would be absolutely wrong. I should never support it, and neither would a Conservative Government, but it does not do that. By reverting to the position which was established in 1971, Parliament will be telling employers that, on the issue of whether it was reasonable, the tribunal has the duty of satisfying itself one way or the other. One does not have to go further and prove not only the reason—not only that it is an OK reason—but also that one acted reasonably. In practice, it will make precious little difference to the way cases are conducted and decided, but it is thought by the people we have consulted to be likely to have a significant psychological effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I turn to the case of the constituent of the right hon. Gentleman. He will not expect me to comment on the individual facts because he knows them better than I do and anything I said would not be reliable, but the guts of it seem to me to be the fact that the individual concerned does not know the real reason why he was dismissed. On the facts as stated by the right hon. Gentleman, that is the case: he does not know. But he does not have to know in order to set up his claim. All he has to show is that he was dismissed. It is then for his employer—in this case, Solar Tubes of Doncaster—to show what the reason was. To take a hypothetical case—I am not commenting on the facts of that case—if the employer in the first instance said that the employee was redundant, it would be rather hard to satisfy a tribunal that the real reason
	<span class='label label-info column'>658</span>
was something else, should that be the case as ultimately presented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will see that the clause does not take away from his constituent, Mr. Boughey, any substantial advantage that the Act at present gives him. I hope that I have reassured him that, for reasons which I entirely understand, he has actually read into the clause a great deal more—and of a very damaging nature—than it contains. I hope that I have satisfied the Committee. If I have not, I must advise my right hon. and hon. Friends to resist the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ron Leighton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I found that a remarkable speech. It did not clear up our doubts on this matter at all. I found it bemusing and confusing, and I hope that I am not easily confused. The hon. and learned Gentleman seemed to be saying that the clause had no legal validity or, rather, no legal consequences—that it would have no real effect at all. It was purely an exercise in psychology. I do not know—other hon. Members can tell me—whether legislation has ever been introduced before as an exercise in psychology. That is a new one on me. The term used in the workshop is "kidology"—that the Government's object is to kid employers or to have a psychological effect on them. I find that curious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased that the hon. and learned Gentleman admitted paternity of the idea of unfair dismissal, and I congratulate him on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I claimed it, not admitted it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not want to get involved in these historical reminiscences, but I think that perhaps my hon. Friend is wrong in attributing to the hon. and learned Gentleman, or to his predecessors, what he describes as paternity. Perhaps he played the role of coucheuse or midwife, but I must tell the hon. and learned Gentleman that the conception, if not the gestation, of the unfair dismissal provisions was with my then right hon. Friend the former Member for Blackburn, Mrs. Barbara Castle. Before the election of 1970 there was a Bill before this House, which had a First Reading, on the cover of which was the name of my right hon. Friend
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0856">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>659</span>
the then Member for Blackburn and my name, in which the unfair dismissal provisions were laid out in almost exactly the same way as they were subsequently reproduced in the 1971 Act, though we did have the burden of proof rather differently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suppose if we were to deal with Barbara Castle we would have to speak of maternity, which perhaps brings us to later clauses and I should be out of order in talking about that. However, I am pleased that the Government are still in favour of this concept of unfair dismissal and that they think it valuable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This clause is deceptively short though clearly important. It has only nine lines. I cannot see any full-stops, except the one at the end. It is just one sentence, and I find it objectionable. If there is one word that the hon. and learned Gentleman has used more than any other in our discussions, it is the word "reasonable", or, as he sometimes puts it, "reasonably practicable". I believe these words occur throughout many statutes, and that is all we are asking for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is deceptively short. The hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) who is regrettably—or unregrettably—absent, clearly never understood it. He showed that on two occasions. Once he thought it dealt with the unions. Later, it was shown to deal with individuals, and I should have thought that, as someone who claims to support individual freedom, he might well have supported us. All we are saying is that it should be—
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the employer to prove that he acted reasonably".</p></blockquote>
"Reasonably" is the hon. and learned Gentleman's favourite word. If he were just to include that phrase we could feel satisfied that this curious wording which has a psychological origin would be suitable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other thing which worries us is the wording about the "size and administrative resources" of the employer. It is only a certain category of employer, apparently, that we are talking about—those without administrative resources. Again, this is unique. I have not heard this before. An individual person does not have any resources, but
	<span class='label label-info column'>660</span>
if he is pulled up under the Highway Code, it is not much good his saying to the officer "Look, I do not have very many resources".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not exempt such employers from any other of their obligations, obligations of contract, to pay bills or anything of that sort. In only this one respect does that consideration come in and people now apparently become expendable. It is only in this respect, according to the clause as drafted, that the employer can act unreasonably. That is a pretty appalling proposition, and I contrast it with all the heartrending comments, even tear-jerking comments, that we have had about people being expelled unreasonably from the closed shop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that there is a closed shop in a small firm, as there often is, such as in a small printing works of about 20 people. It is trade union organised. If the trade union expelled a member unreasonably, there would be an outcry. But here, when we are talking about a small firm dealing with individuals, my reading of this is that the employer can act unreasonably and without a murmur of complaint.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged to the hon. Gentleman for giving way and I interrupt his speech only in order to correct an important misapprehension. It is not the effect of this clause to permit unreasonable behaviour by an employer to justify dismissal. Quite the reverse. All that is being said is this. The law shall remain that for dismissal not to be unfair it must be for an OK reason and one must act reasonably in regarding the OK reason as ground for dismissal. The law is to be unchanged in that regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only change is that the legal burden of proving that one acted reasonably in treating the OK reason as a ground for dismissal is lifted from the shoulders of the employer and placed fairly and squarely in the middle—not placed upon the employee to show that it was unreasonable but left in the middle so that the tribunal, when it looks at the whole of the evidence put before it, has to make up its own mind. There is no legal burden of proving it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, while it has legal con-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0857">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>661</span>
sequence, what I was saying was that it has very little practical consequence, because the employer would always wish to bring forward to the tribunal whatever evidence was relevant to whether he acted reasonably in treating the OK reason as ground for dismissal. He will always want to do that. Very few cases hinge upon the legal burden of proof. I hope I have made that clear. It is not justifying unreasonable conduct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is some explanation. Instead of the onus of proof being on the employer, it is now being moved into the middle and therefore the balance is moved away from the employer—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:—and more on to the employee. If we are talking about resources, I should have thought that the employer, even a small employer, would have more resources than the individual worker. I do not see this as such a great burden on that employer. There are insurance schemes whereby a small employer who is worried about this can insure himself—II believe that in 1978 the premium was as low as £8 per worker—for all the consequences that would flow from a tribunal. So I do not find convincing the idea that this is a heavy burden on the employer and we have to help him psychologically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the idea that there was some great demand for this change—the Under-Secretary mentioned the letters that he has received—I have taken the trouble to look at what the CBI had to say at the time if its last conference in the background paper which it issued. Session II dealt with this under the heading of "Specific encouragement for smaller firms". It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The CBI Smaller Firms Council has placed its main emphasis on the need to cut back government regulation and intervention and, by reducing tax burdens, to create and leave more resources in the hands of small businesses."</p></blockquote>
Clearly, the CBI was most concerned about taxes. It set out in order of preference that it wanted:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Major cuts in income tax.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Reforming and reducing capital taxation.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Reducing administrative burdens imposed by government"—</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>662</span>
all the form-filling and so on—and only after that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Amending employment legislation."</p></blockquote>
The main argument in the paper seems to be that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Smaller firms are particularly vulnerable to tight monetary conditions and high interest rates."</p></blockquote>
That is what the CBI is worrying about. I have heard of no great demand for an alteration in the law in this respect. We have heard from the Secretary of State that the country is demanding the Bill, but I am certain that it is not on these grounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last body to which I refer is the British Institute of Management, which makes quite clear that it supports the Bill, and states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It will be apparent that the BIM view is very much in accordance with the intentions of the Employment Bill."</p></blockquote>
But when the institute comes to what it calls "the second part", it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The second proposal met with slightly less support. This was the suggestion to exempt new firms with less than 20 employees from the unfair dismissal provisions for the first two years of trading. A small majority of our members agreed, as did IIM. Some BIM members thought that the provision would be open to abuse, and suggested that it would be better to encourage small firms by other means."</p></blockquote>
No one can construe that as a ringing affirmation of clause 5. Frankly, I know of no major employers' group or anybody else who is demanding clause 5. I ask the Under-Secretary to look at this again and search his mind on whether he could accept the words in the amendment—
	<br><blockquote><p>"it shall be for the employer to prove that he acted reasonably.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Secretary of State to the Committee. I am sorry to learn that he has been in trouble and I hope that he finds here this morning a more sympathetic atmosphere than he has found elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that it is common ground—we always like to find common ground in this Committee—that legal protection from unfair dismissal is one of the essential rights for employees. It is probably one of the hallmarks of a civilised industrial society that we have this kind of protection. The Opposition believe that it is important, if it is in formal terms, that the burden of proof should be on, and should remain on,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0858">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>663</span>
the employer because, in the way that we run our industries today, the employer has the initiative in management and he does the dismissing. It is therefore fair that the employer should have to show the reason and reasonableness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been told by the hon. and learned Gentleman, in his most honourable and learned way, that this is a technical change, that what is being altered is just the formal burden of proof and that, from a practical point of view, the burden of proof will remain with the employer. In all industrial tribunal cases, it is the evidence which decides the case—the evidence of the trade union representative, the employee's representative and the legal representative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point is that, as the hon. and learned Gentleman said, the employer still has the burden of showing the reason for the dismissal. He has talked about the four OK reasons. In practical terms, the employer is the only person in possession of the evidence, so he will have to provide the proof. Perhaps I may help, or even strengthen the hon. and learned Gentleman's case. He might have added—perhaps he did and I was not listening carefully—that the formal burden of proof which the clause changes comes into play in only a tiny minority of cases, that is, when, having heard all the evidence, the industrial tribunal is unable to make up its mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment, if the case is balanced and the industrial tribunal is unable to make up its mind, it has to find dismissal unfair because the burden of proof lies on the employer. Under the clause that would be changed and it would just have to make up its mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman says that that is a small and unimportant change. That prompts the question: why do the Government bother at all? Why is he annoying the Opposition and making trade unionists worried? The TUC sees it as a major change, and trade unionists see it as a major change. Why is he disturbing us all in this way? He says that it is important in terms of psychology, that the Employment Protection Act as it stands frightens employers off from taking on new workers and if it is changed by the clause employers will rush out to take on new workers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>664</span>
That is a very thin case. The hon. and learned Gentleman has produced almost no evidence to justify his position. Indeed, that has, been the tone of the Government's argument throughout. I am not criticising the hon. and learned Gentleman for the way in which he has presented that case to the Committee. He has done it with great skill. But it has been noticeable that, when we start to probe, he is always very weak in coming forward with evidence to justify the change which he hopes to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government say that it is psychology. My hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton) says that it is "kidology". But what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. We believe that, whatever the legal justification and whatever the precise legal change that will take place, the change is important for psychological reasons, but in a different way from the one which the hon. and learned Gentleman advances. It will make employees feel more insecure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We face a difficult situation, and employees throughout the country must feel more insecure as they hear about more and more redundancies. But at least they have had the comfort of knowing that the Employment Protection Act gave them that formal protection and that the burden of proof was on the employer. Now that is being changed, and if they feel themselves to be more insecure, the Government will have only themselves to blame. That is the main reason why we strongly support the amendment moved so well by my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Mikardo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman for his clear and helpful exposition of the way in which section 57 of the 1978 Act works. It is much clearer to me now than it was before he gave us the benefit of his advice. However, using the jargon of dialectics, I am bound to say that his synthesis was not as good as his analysis, and when he reached the latter end of his observations he did not carry much conviction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is idle to say that what the Government have done is put the obligation for assessing reasonableness on the tribunal, because that obligation is there
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0859">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>665</span>
anyway. It is there under section 57, it is there under clause 5 as drafted, and it would still be there if our amendment were incorporated. It is in the nature of a tribunal that it must assess the relative validity of the two causes pleaded before it. Of course, it is the tribunal, and nobody else, which has to decide in the final issue whether the dismissal is reasonable. So I do not understand what point the hon. and learned Gentleman was making when he put that argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see some force in the hon. and learned Gentleman saying that where the burden of proof is placed may not make a great deal of difference in practice in a large number of cases. But it can do so in some cases. Particularly, the burden of proof is important in situations in which there is a notable difference of strength between the two parties to the argument. Although I am not a lawyer, I have the feeling that that is something which most lawyers would accept as being reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here we have two parties with great differences of strength. The most important difference is the one which has been pointed out by my hon. Friends, namely, the relative potential loss which each of the parties sustains. The worst that can happen to the employer is that he has to re-engage a chap, who cannot be too bad because he engaged him in the first place and kept him at work for a certain period. Alternatively, he must pay some money in compensation. That is the worst that can happen to the employer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The worst that can happen to the employee is that he loses his livelihood and he has a black mark on his record which stays there for all the time that he is trying to earn a living by being an employee. That is the first radical difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second radical difference in strength between the two parties is in access to information. The employer has the evidence on which he can back his contention and the worker very seldom has. My right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker) cited the case of somebody who was dismissed because it was alleged that he was a bad time keeper, worse than all the other people in the factory. The employer has the time-keeping records of everybody in the factory; the em-
	<span class='label label-info column'>666</span>
ployee has not. If the employee says that he knows what goes on in his shop, that he does not come late any more than other people and he does not come later than other people, he cannot prove it. He does not have the clocking-on record; the employer has the clocking-on record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Or the employer may say that the dismissal is fair because the chap is in breach of the works rules. The employer has the works rules on file; he has a personnel department which is expert in those rules and in detecting a real or alleged violation or breach. The worker probably does not have a copy of the works rules at all. There are many firms in which there are established works rules and people are taken on without being given a copy of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we know from hard experience, some of these works rules, or trade rules, or industry rules are idiotic. Is it not idiotic—I never understand why we, all of us, tolerate it—that one can stop an industry by working to rule; that is to say, by carrying out its rules? Is that not absolutely daft?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only rules I have looked through at all carefully are those which govern aircraft inspectors after maintenance or repair of aircraft. I assure the Committee, on the basis of my not very expert examination of those rules, that if every inspector in British Airways carried out the rules that he is instructed to carry out, and the honouring of which are a condition of his receiving a certificate from the board, without which he cannot practice his trade, no aeroplane would ever leave the ground. I am told that the rules are nearly as daft on the railways. It is silly, is it not, that the effect of carrying out industrial law—if I may call works rules and trade rules "industrial law" in shorthand—is to stop society functioning? If our own rules had that effect, we would rapidly do something about it, but nobody in industry sees the anomaly and tries to do something about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was a bit of a digression, and I apologise for it, Mr. Goodhew. The point I am making is that whether the rules be good or ill, the employer knows them. He has them on file; he has executives one of whose principal functions is to be familiar with them and to monitor their implementation. The employee almost certainly does not even
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0860">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>667</span>
have a copy of the rules, let alone know them, either because he was not given a copy when he was engaged, which is a not uncommon situation—it is improper but not uncommon—or because he was given a copy and he has lost it and does not know where it is. In any case, most rules are in horrible jargon which it is very difficult for an ordinary layman to understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So one can find an employer who says "This chap was always breaching works rules", or "he was breaching rule No. 17(4)," or whatever, and there is an imbalance in the competence of the two parties to make representations to a tribunal on matters relating to the rules. The employer may say "I dismissed this chap because a health and safety inspector came round and inspected our premises and said in his report that some of the things this chap was doing were against the law or constituted a danger to himself and his fellow workers," or whatever. The employer has a copy of that inspector's report; the worker does not. How does he start to refute the allegations if he does not even have a copy of the report? The whole thing is frightfully one-sided; it is a piece of one-sided discrimination such as the Government are always bleating about. When they speak about the need for balance, they might take a look at this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman seemed to me to be behaving in a particular lawyer's way, if I may use the term without offence. I remember hearing years ago a story about the young son of a barrister who was at a public school. He was called up before the headmaster and charged with having broken a window by chucking a stone at it. He pleaded that it was not a stone but a brick; alternatively, if it was a stone, it was not the window that it was alleged to have been thrown at; and, alternatively, if it was the window that it was alleged to have been thrown at, it was not he who threw it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman has been behaving a bit like that. I cannot take his fairy-tale story—with all his 150 letters—that there are people dying to set up businesses who say "I've got a great idea. I've just had a new invention—an entirely new type of pen. All I have to do is make and my fortune will be
	<span class='label label-info column'>668</span>
made. But I'd better not start up this business and make my fortune, because I shall not be allowed to dismiss anyone unfairly" If there are such animals—people who do not know how to be employers if they are deprived of the night to dismiss people unfairly, we are better off without them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second thing that I want to say to him is—as I have said before and I shall go on saying—that it is not that which inhibits new starters in enterprise or small men from expanding. What inhibits them is that they cannot get capital as easily as entrepreneurs in other countries. When they do get it, they have to pay 18 per cent. for it. That is what inhibits them. The biggest deterrent to employing a man is that one can make more by lending one's money than one can from the work of that man. The hon. and learned Gentleman wants to know in practice, if not in theory, what is holding up enterprise in this country. I do not believe and I do not think that anyone believes this fairytale of the man who is deterred from otherwise exciting enterprise by the horrible fear that, if he dismisses someone when he thinks it fair to dismiss him, he will have to prove that it was fair to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman has been putting an either/or argument with several fallback positions. He is saying that the onus of proof does not have any effect in practice but that, although it means nothing one way or the other, we dare not have it in the way set out in the amendment. I have never heard the hon. and learned Gentleman more suave and less convincing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>669</span>
squarely on the shoulders of an employer to prove that they have taken a reasonable and responsible attitude in dismissing an employee."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, it does make a difference. It is really being introduced not for psychological reasons but to make it more difficult for a dismissed employee to convince the tribunal. If a contract of employment is broken, it is the man who breaks the contract who should be investigated by any tribunal or court. But in this instance the dismissed employee has to present his case, and the tribunal need not listen to any case put forward by the employer. In many instances the employee is inarticulate and, unless he is represented by a trade union official, he may have difficulty in stating his case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, of course, in the past the employer, as a signatory to or at least as the initiator of a contract of employment, has really been the culprit. He has taken the decision to dismiss an employee and, when he comes before the industrial tribunal, he should be questioned on the reasons for that dismissal. The employees will obviously be at a great disadvantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only reason which has been brought forward by the hon. and learned and suave Gentleman is that it may be a disincentive to employers if they are faced with the task of appearing before a tribunal; and that, as a consequence, they might not set up in business. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) has said, this is not a disincentive at all. Most prospective employers have to worry first of all about raising capital; secondly, about paying tremendous interest rates when they do raise capital. They have to face problems of a high rate of value added tax and, as my hon. Friend said, if they have the money to invest in industry, they can obtain a better return by leaving it in the bank or lending it to someone else than by starting in industry. These are the real problems that face a prospective employer, not the problems of having to appear before a tribunal to answer for their acts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the last analysis, this is what is happening. If an employer dismisses an employee, he takes the action. It is not initiated by the employee; it is initiated
	<span class='label label-info column'>670</span>
by the employer. As a consequence, he should then face the tribunal. He should be cross-questioned, and he should have to justify his action. It seems to me that in no other case can a man initiate an action which will probably deprive an employee of his livelihood in the future and will certainly deprive him of compensation, and not be cross-questioned so that blame can be attributed by the tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all these reasons, the hon., learned and suave Gentleman should reconsider whether it is in the interests of the Bill to go forward with the clause. He has assured us that it will make little difference to the present law: employers will have to bring forward a concrete case; they can be cross-examined and so on, and it will make very little difference. If that is the case, I plead with him to reconsider this matter and to withdraw clause 5.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The whole burden of the hon. Gentleman's speech has been that, where an employer dismisses somebody, he ought to be put in the position where he has to justify that dismissal by coming forward and being cross-questioned. That is what the hon. Gentleman said. I beg him to accept from me that that is exactly what the law says at the moment and what it will continue to say. Once the worker, the claimant, has shown that he has been dismissed, it is for the employer to come forward and say "I sacked him for this reason, and it is an OK reason under the Act," and on all that he is open to cross-examination. Exactly what the hon. Gentleman says will remain the law as it is at the moment. I hope he accepts that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That does not seem to be reflected in the clause, which says that the whole issue should be determined on
	<br><blockquote><p>"equity and the substantial merits of the case."</p></blockquote>
That is the basis on which the case has to be considered. It says earlier that whether the employer acted reasonably or unreasonably is not a sufficient reason for considering that case. It has to be considered solely on
	<br><blockquote><p>"equity and the substantial merits of the case."</p></blockquote>
If the hon. and learned Gentleman is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0862">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>671</span>
talking of this, and that is not the case, it will be quite easy for him to accept amendment No. 77 which specifically states the position as he is trying to interpret it to this Committee. It seems that he is snapping at a gnat when he refuses this reasonable request. All that he has to do, if his interpretation is to be beyond any doubt, is to accept amendment No. 77. I plead with him to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: During the course of the hon. and learned Gentleman's reply to my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster (Mr. Walker), the Under-Secretary said I had not heard the opening part of his remarks because I was out of the Committee room. I apologise to him and to the Committee for not being present. On the other hand, I think it is important that the hon. and learned Gentleman knows why I was out of the room. I was discussing with the hon. Member for Norfolk, South (Mr. MacGregor) my request that this Committee should not meet on Thursday afternoon to allow the Committee to participate in the motion of no confidence which will be before the House on Thursday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this respect I echo the comments of my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, who protested about the way this Committee had moved since it was established. It will be important that the Government Whips give serious consideration to our request that this Committee does not sit on Thursday afternoon because, particularly in view of the Prime Minister's broadcast last night, it will be obvious that the Secretary of State will have to be on the Front Bench, at least when his right hon. Friend the Prime Minister is speaking, otherwise there will be various inferences drawn from the fact that the Secretary of State is not present. It was in that context that I was out of the room for that brief moment when the Under-Secretary was replying:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, I intended no criticism. I think we all know the hon. Gentleman's duties as a Whip. I merely observed that when he intervened to castigate what I was saying as "rubbish" or some other elegant expression, I was quite prepared to accept that it might be rubbish but only really from people who had heard the whole submission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>672</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what the hon. and learned Gentleman says, but I am sure he appreciates as much as I do that when it is on the record that someone is not present, it always gives an impression of discourtesy to the speaker. In view of the fact that what I was discussing was of some importance, it was right that the record was put straight. I hope that the Government Whips will accede to our request that the Committee should not meet on Thursday afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, to move on to the amendment which we are discussing this morning, it is important that we try to get it across to some—that is if there are any—libertarians left in the Tory Party in relation to this amendment—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is interesting to hear that comment from the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst), who is one of the strangest libertarians I have ever had the misfortune to bump into. However, it may well be that we will take the hon. Gentleman with us, because what it appears has happened in relation to this amendment and to clause 5 is that Government supporters have assumed that this is another attack on the trade union movement, and the Opposition are responding in that fashion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me make it quite clear that this is not an attack on the trade union movement at all because, wherever there is a sound trade union organisation, one of the foremost issues is that it will defend the rights of a member who has been dismissed unfairly. What we are really concerned about, and this may be slightly paradoxical, is individuals who work in small firms who are often not members of trade unions and have no one to defend them. When we are talking in terms of people appearing before a tribunal, if the individual is a trade unionist the getting to a tribunal is the last link in the chain. In a trade union, one goes through a lot before reaching the tribunal stage. But the person who will be concerned under clause 5 is the individual who is sacked on the spot, literally sent out of the door and who, as often as not, will come looking for a Member of Parliament to help him because he has no trade union organisation to back him up. When he gets to the tribunal, he will be facing a body of people who obviously have far more
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0863">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>673</span>
knowledge than he has and, generally speaking, with an employer or employer's representative who has much more knowledge than he has, and he will be alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So the first thing that we should establish in relation to the hon. and learned Gentleman's arguments is that the employer and the employee are not equal. They are far from being equal. The strength and power lies with the employer in every set of circumstances. What must be established quite clearly is that we shall be talking about an individual if he has the right to to go to a tribunal under an unfair dismissal case who will have been in employment for at least one year with that employer. Unless he has worked for 52 weeks, he has no right to make application under that heading. It is in those circumstances that we have to consider what sort of cases are involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already shown that we shall not be talking about trade union cases. It will very rarely be a case, where an employer is trying to get rid of a man because he has been a shop steward or a convener. In those circumstances, there is a sound defence on the part of the trade union movement and the workers involved in that plant. We shall be talking about individuals who do not have any of that backing. The man will have worked for 12 months. So the arguments about bad timekeeping or incompetence can hardly apply. No employer will keep for 12 months before actually sacking him a man who has a bad record of timekeeping or who is incompetent. He will sack the man long before he reaches that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is then that we look at what would be involved in any of these unfair dismissal cases. Even the briefest study of some of the cases that have come before tribunals over the past couple of years will indicate that invariably it is a breakdown of human relations between an employer or an employer's representative—a foreman or chargehand—and the individual concerned. Often the reason is trivial to the person reading about the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that it is important to the individual concerned—but often for the most trivial reasons such as an affaire between a male and a female employee or sometimes between an employer and an employee, or a disagreement about the capabilities of a football team. It may be a Liverpool supporter and an Everton supporter, or Manchester United and Manchester City supporters—or Newcastle
	<span class='label label-info column'>674</span>
and Sunderland supporters—or Rochdale, though nobody would disagree with a Rochdale supporter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But, to return to the serious point, it is this sort of issue which is involved in unfair dismissal cases, a breakdown in human relations. Invariably it is the employer exercising his dogmatic rights as the owner of the plant to sack anybody whom he does not like. That is what the vast majority of these cases come down to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right that the balance should be the way that it is at present and the way to which the amendment seeks to restore it. It should be for the employer to prove that he has acted reasonably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must appreciate that we are talking about taking away a man's livelihood. It is hypocritical for the Tory Party to talk at length about the iniquities and evils of a trade union taking away a man's rights when the Under-Secretary demonstrated at an earlier sitting that there were only four cases in the recorded history of the trade union movement of that happening. My hon. Friends and I could demonstrate, not hundreds or thousands, but hundreds of thousands of cases over the past 75 years where men and women have lost their jobs because they have been sacked by their employers, often in the most dubious circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Tory Party seems to get the balance wrong. Members of the Tory Party demonstrate, they write articles in leading newspapers, they go on television to broadcast about the evils of the trade union movement. They make speeches in the House on the subject. But when we refer to the dangers and the problems on the other side of the balance, there is a deafening silence from the Tory Party. It is not interested in individual human rights; it is interested in restoring a balance which existed many, many years ago when men and women lost their jobs—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we have sought—as most Western democratic countries have sought to do over the past 25 years—to bring a sort of balance into industrial relations, we have always been opposed by the employers. The difference is that in most other countries the Government have recognised the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0864">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>675</span>

	<p>12 noon</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the hon. Gentleman slightly exaggerating the number of people who have been dismissed? He is not taking into account those people who have had their union cards removed and who consequently may have lost their jobs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We went down that track when debating a previous clause. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman was present or whether he was listening, but we established that there were only four such cases involved in the past two or three years. If the hon. Gentleman wants me to take the Committee through the cases of unfair dismissal in which I have been involved, for instance in the shipbuilding, ship repairing and heavy engineering industry on Tyneside, I should be happy to do that. I can assure the Committee that there are an enormous number of cases of unfair dismissal and of dismissal in the most dubious of circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to help my hon. Friend. The hon. and learned Gentleman himself said in the debate on a previous clause that the main work of the industrial tribunals was concerned with unfair dismissals, and that the volume of the work relating to unfair dismissals was so great that it would not be appropriate for the appeals tribunal to consider questions of that, as well as questions of law. In other words, there is a vast volume of work in dealing with unfair dismissal cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that helpful intervention, which I am sure has satisfied the hon. Gentleman that he has opened an avenue which will be most useful to us when we come to debate later clauses in the Bill. I am sure that the hon. Member for Norfolk, South, would prefer me not to start relating to the Committee the various unfair dismissal cases that I personally have been involved in over my lifetime in the shipbuilding and ship repairing industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there is one point which I should like to make this morning, particularly now that the Secretary of State has returned to the Committee. We understand
	<span class='label label-info column'>676</span>
his difficulties; we understand that he has to make concessions to the hard line Right-wingers in the Cabinet, who are obviously giving him a very rough time indeed. I read in 
	<i>The Times</i>this morning that apart from his gaffe in relation to his remarks about Sir Charles Villiers, the chairman of the British Steel Corporation—and I should like to make it clear that I agree 100 per cent. with the right hon. Gentleman, that the sooner the top management of the British Steel Corporation is sacked, the better—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the hon. Member does not intend to read us the whole of 
	<i>The Times</i>or any other newspaper that he may have found attractive, because much as I might like to hear it, we must keep in line with the amendment before the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely grateful, Mr. Goodhew. Once again you have corrected me when I was in danger of straying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that my hon. Friend was about to hypothesise about whether such a dismissal might be fair or unfair, and I was wondering against whom he thought any action might lie if Sir Charles Villiers was dismissed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope the hon. Member will not be tempted by his right hon. Friend, who is a very interesting advocate; I hope that we will now get on with the debate on the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With your support, Mr. Goodhew, I am sure I shall be able to resist the temptation of my right hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wanted to refer to a short passage in 
	<i>The Times.</i>It is only a few lines. It relates to the Prime Minister's broadcast last night. I quote from the first column on the front page, where it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Various interpretations were being placed on her revelation:"—</p></blockquote>
that is, in relation to the right hon. Gentleman—
	<br><blockquote><p>"from everything had been forgiven, to Mr. Prior being given a second chance."</p></blockquote>
We appreciate that the Secretary of State will have to write things into the Bill which are probably anathema to him but will placate his hon. Friends such as the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst). When he addressed the Select
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0865">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>677</span>
Committee, the comment in 
	<i>The Guardian</i> of 21 February was headed:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'Cowardice' jibe by Tory MP angers Prior".</p></blockquote>
I understand the right hon. Gentleman's difficulties. With friends like that, who needs enemies? Indeed, I suspect that he feels that he has more friends on this side of the Committee than on his own. We understand his difficulties and we recognise that he will have to put certain bits in the Bill, which he probably despises himself, as the quid pro quo to placate those who wish to introduce one-clause Bills which would throw half the trade unionists in Great Britain into gaol. That opens another avenue, but I shall resist going down it for the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that there are libertarians left on the Government Benches, although they seem remarkably denuded. Indeed, if I suggested to my hon. Friends that they left the Committee, we should be without a quorum. But I shall not go down that track, either. I hope that those hon. Gentlemen who are outside in the corridor will get the message, either by telepathy or because I have raised my voice, will come back into the Committee and will appreciate that what we suggest is that they should strike a small blow for liberty. They should recognise that the balance between the employer and the employee, particularly in small firms, is being put badly out of joint and they have a duty to restore it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the only reason why I accused the hon. and learned Gentleman of waffling. I respect him and the arguments that he presents to the Committee. When he has an awful case, he is an expert in presenting it at some length. To suggest that this clause would be beneficial in creating employment among the entrepreneurs about whom the Secretary of State for Industry is constantly blowing his trumpet, and that they will come galloping over the hill as soon as it is on the statute book, is, with respect, absolute rubbish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not need to mention minimum lending rate, VAT or the other things which appall small business men. I merely say that what the Minister is doing this morning is disgraceful and is not in the best traditions of the Tory Party. Even at this late hour, if he cannot accept our amendment, he should accept the spirit of it and restore the balance in favour of working people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>678</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Gentleman makes a speech like that, he reminds me of a driver going round and round a roundabout. Avenue after avenue is opened up but he resists going down any one of them. It is a repetitive and somewhat circular experience for those who have to observe it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But interesting and novel points have been explored in the speeches of other hon. Gentlemen and I shall try to reply to them. The hon. Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton) questioned whether there was any pressure from interest groups for this clause. He referred to the British Institute of Management, and it may be helpful to the Committee if I read what it has said to us in a second submission:
	<br><blockquote><p>"BIM's earlier submission supported the view that the burden of proof, demonstrating a fair dismissal, should remain with the employer. The onus of proving the employer's reasonable behaviour"—</p></blockquote>
that is what clause 5 is on about:
	<br><blockquote><p>"however, as distinct from showing that the reason for dismissal was justified by statute, was not a point included in the earlier consultation. The question has now been asked, and BIM members support the Department of Employment's suggestion that the law should not specifically place the onus to show reasonableness on either employer or employee.".</p></blockquote>
It is said that employers are more concerned about taxes. That was particularly the point made by the hon. Members for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo), for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton), for Newton (Mr. Evans) and for Darlington (Mr. Fletcher).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: And minimum lending rate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, and minimum lending rate. I think that is right. I do not pretend for a moment that most employers worry more about the burden of proving reason ableness in the unfair dismissal jurisdiction than they worry about the minimum lending rate. But to say that that is the real problem that they are worrying about implies that the employment protection legislation is not a real problem. It can be a real problem though a relatively minor one. That is how I would put it in this regard. To say that, when there is the opportunity of relieving immediately a minor problem, it must not be done because there are major ones whose resolution will take a little longer does not seem to be a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0866">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>679</span>
very sensible way of going about the business of government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. and learned Gentleman tell the Committee how many firms, particularly small firms, have been driven into bankruptcy because of the unfair provisions of the Employment Protection Act and how many small employers are threatened with bankruptcy because of minimum lending rate as at present?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should not think that many, if any, have been driven into bankruptcy, though one can visualise, I suppose, a firm in a very precarious situation being driven bankrupt by a substantial award of compensation. I can visualise it, but I am not aware of one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Within the concept of job protection and unfair dismissal and remaining loyal to that concept, we want to see whether there are any ways in which the burdens at present imposed upon employers can be lifted so as to encourage more people to become employers, more people to offer jobs. That is what we are concerned about. I hope that what I said at the beginning of my speech will be accepted as evidence and as an earnest that the Government are as much behind the Tightness of unfair dismissal compensation as they were when they introduced it into our law in 1971.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely, the hon. and learned Gentleman will accept that few employers have specifically complained about this point about the burden of proof. It is quite different if the British Institute of Management asks its constituents whether they would like to have it changed and whether they would like to have the burden of proof taken away from them. Of course, everybody will reply "Yes". But if people are asked specifically what the problems are, it is interesting that in all the surveys, even in the Department of Employment survey, the burden of proof has been specifically raised by an extraordinarily small number of employers— not enough to justify the action being taken by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the hon. and learned Gentleman accept also that the industrial tribunals have interpreted the word "reasonable" very fairly, so we are not talking about a very serious issue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>680</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can only tell the hon. about the Gentleman, as I have said already, that large numbers of employers have written to the Department complaining that they are guilty until they are proved innocent. We are not plucking this out of a hat or out of the air and changing it for the fun of it. We are responding to a substantial and recurring expression of anxiety about the law as it stands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his speech the hon. Member for Chester-le-Street (Mr. Radice) said that the tribunal would now have to make up its mind on whether the employer acted reasonably. Surely, that is what it is there for. We have a system of tripartite tribunals, based upon experienced people, which have to make up their mind about a situation on the evidence brought before them from both sides. It is not very worrying that we are leaving it to an experienced tribunal to make up its own mind on whether the employer has acted reasonably. That is what tribunals are all about. They can only do it on the basis of evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I am asked where is the further evidence of demand for this change, I have to say that it is not very easy even for the Department of Employment to conduct a survey of people who have not become employers. I can only assure the Committee that the Government are reacting to a strongly and recurringly expressed anxiety about the law as it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I shall not persuade the Committee by saying it more than once more, but there is a widespread feeling, which the Government regards as damaging to the prospects of employment, among people who are thinking of employing more people or who are thinking of becoming employers that they are guilty until they are proved innocent when any question of unfair dismissal arises. That is damaging. It can be remedied in part without doing any significant damage to the concept of unfair dismissal by which the Government stand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to deal with the serious point raised by the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Mikardo) and to thank him for his kind references to my earlier speech. He asked what was the problem and said that the burden is there already, that the tribunal has the duty to decide whether the employer has acted reasonably, and that it was inherent in the legislation. Yes, but the tribunal can only assess that on the evidence presented. It is not able to say that it has consulted its prejudices or looked at the entrails. It can only proceed on the basis of the evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the 1978 Act, the employer has to adduce the evidence which proves the case. There is a very small minority of cases where, on the evidence adduced, the tribunal is left like that—it is an exact position of equilibrium—a tiny proportion of cases, but it exists. In that tiny proportion, the fact that the burden of proving the case, of proving that he acted reasonably, is placed expressly by the statute on the employer, is decisive. It means that in law the tribunal must say that he has not proved that he has acted reasonably, and therefore the claimant succeeds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that that is unnecessary. It is a tiny proportion of cases. We believe that the right way to do it is to say that the tribunal must decide whether it is established that reasonable conduct is demon-
	<span class='label label-info column'>682</span>
strated. To make it a burden on the employer not only to show the reason but that it was an OK reason and also that it was a reason that he was reasonable in regarding as a ground for dismissal is going too far against the basic concept of our law that he who complains ought to prove—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel that it is my duty to prevent dissension in the ranks of the Committee, Mr. Goodhew, and when two hon. Gentlemen stand up together I think I should try to complete my point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a matter of judgment, and at the end of the day one can do no more than explain the reason that one has come to a judgment on the reason for the clause and put it forward in that way. I doubt that to giving way once more to the hon. Member for Chester-le-Street (Mr. Radice) will persuade him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow goes on to take the case of somebody who has been complained of by a health and safety inspector. How can he know what the merits of the case are, says the hon. Gentleman, since he has not even seen the report? But there is he unrealistic, if I may say so, because one of the things that the tribunal takes into account is whether the employer has followed the guidelines laid down by ACAS in its disciplinary code. He will know that in that code, under article 10F, there is a provision that individuals must be informed of the complaints against them and be given an opportunity to state their case before decisions are made. The tribunals are not mutts. That is what they are there for—to use their common sense and their experience. That is a practical answer to that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, the hon. Gentleman referred to the rules and said that an employer could say to an employee "I am sacking you because you have broken the rules". He could go the tribunal and say just that. But an industrial tribunal will say "Hold on. How consistent are you in your application of the rules? We have heard the complainant, the sacked employee, say that everybody broke this one, and you winked an eye at it". They will ask those
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0868">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>683</span>
questions for themselves, even if the employee does not argue the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that people who appear without lawyers often do much better than people who do in many cases. A litigant in person is the hardest advocate to defeat, in my experience. I remember being defeated by two Cypriots in person plus their interpreter, in the county court, in a very humiliating hearing. The interpreter actually did it. I believe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that, uncharacteristically for him, the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow is seeing this clause as beset by tigers at every turn—and by industrial tribunals—and that is really not the case. These are informal tribunals, and their great forte is the experience of their side members, to say nothing of their chairman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Radice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I have actually remembered what I wanted to say, I am grateful to the hon. and learned Member for giving way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us grant for a moment that the employers are right and that this is a major issue to them. Let us give the Conservatives their case. Will it relieve their concern if this clause is passed and the onus of proof is changed, when, as the hon. and learned Gentleman says, this is a very small and formal change and in practice the burden of proof will rest on the employers?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This will get around, and employers coming to the industrial tribunals will find that everything is very much as it was before. Therefore, this will not satisfy the critics. The hon. Member for Hendon, North (M r. Gorst) will be back again saying that his Front Bench are a lot of cowards and so on, and there will not be the psychological boost to employers that the hon. and learned Gentleman thinks there will be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it is a small but useful measure, and it will have a small but useful effect. I do not think that it is a matter of major importance to employers, but it is of significant importance. When this country faces the unemployment prospects that it does, I do not believe that any Government can afford to reject an opportunity of removing anything that constitutes an obstacle to creating more jobs. We cannot afford to do that. We are all faced with these problems, and many worse; the minimum lending rate is among
	<span class='label label-info column'>684</span>
them at the moment and is probably the first of them. But if there is anything that we can do without causing damage to other things that we hold dear, we ought to do it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important though short point. As I understand the position now, as the Under-Secretary has explained it, the person dismissed first has to prove that he has been dismissed, and that his dismissal is within the terms of the Act and from there on—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: He does not have to prove anything—just that he has been dismissed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg the hon. Gentleman's pardon. He is right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then for the employer to prove a dismissal was for one of the appropriate reasons, the OK reasons as the hon. Gentleman calls them. No one from there on has any further onus of proof. How can the tribunal make up its mind, how can it have the evidence there on which to make up its mind, when the person who holds all the evidence, because it is in his files, has no duty on him to put the evidence before the tribunal? If he does not have to defend himself, if he does not have to justify his action, why on earth should he come along with the evidence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would be a major defect if that were law, but it is not. Nor will it be changed, because the law at present says that it shall be for the employer to show what was the reason and it shall be for the employer to show that it was an OK reason.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Crowther</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason, but not the reasonableness of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is what it is all about. The employer has to show he sacked him for one of the OK reasons. Let us suppose it related to his conduct. He has to show what that reason was and that it came within the four. He then knows that he will be "done" for compensation unless the tribunal finds he acted reasonably. He knows that. Any employer who has any evidence that he believes justifies his action in sacking the employee will, of

	<span class='label label-info column'>685</span>
course, to bring it forward. If he does not, he is on risk. There the position stands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a clause brought forward by a Government who are resiling from a concept which their predecessor introduced in 1971. Not a bit. This is a clause which the Government introduce because they believe it will make a modest contribution to employment without doing any harm to the right to be compensated for unfair dismissal. In those circumstances, I have to advise my right hon. and hon. Friends, notwithstanding the points being made, to resist the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid I must press the hon. and learned Gentlemen a little further. I am anxious we should not detain the Committee too long, and I understand that we will be asked to forgo a debate on "clause stand part". It is not unreasonable to press this so that we make sure that the Government understand our argument. I am not sure that they do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman keeps falling back on the alleged resentment of employers that they have to prove that they are not guilty. The hon. and learned Gentleman falls back on the phrase "he who alleges must prove". But only if he really is understanding the concern on this side of the Committee about who is the injured person in this situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me put it to the hon. and learned Gentleman in this way. If someone threw a brick through my window at my home, I might assume it was because the hon. and learned Gentleman and I had had tussles in this Committee, that he had lost his temper and had thrown a brick through my window, and I allege to the police that the hon. and learned Gentleman has thrown a brick through my window. Of course, it is for me to prove that the hon. and learned Gentleman has thrown the brick through my window. I accept that entirely. But if everybody in this Committee sees the hon. and learned Gentleman throw the brick through my window, and he admits "Yes, I threw a brick through the window", in those circumstances it is not for me—in the subsequent court proceedings when I am seeking to recover damages from him—to prove that he behaved unreasonably.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nor would it be under the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>686</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be for the hon. and learned Gentleman, if he wanted to, accepting that he had thrown the brick, to argue that he had behaved reasonably. He might say, "The building was on fire, I thought the right hon. Member for Doncaster was asleep in bed, and I was seeking to save his life by putting a brick through his window". He is arguing then that he has behaved reasonably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose the injury takes a different form, that the hon. and learned Gentleman is my employer and I am his employee, and he has sacked me, so that the injury that he has inflicted upon me is of a different form. He is saying that, in these circumstances, he should not be required to prove that he has not behaved unreasonably in an action which he has admitted has taken place. He has sacked me; that is undeniable. I accept it; he accepts it. But he is saying that what ought to happen now is that, instead of his arguing before the court that he acted reasonably and my arguing that he acted unreasonably, neither of us should do anything other than submit to the tribunal, and it is for the tribunal to try to decide the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that it is the hon. and learned Gentleman who is putting the law the wrong way round and merely seeking to follow the pattern of the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other argument on which the hon. and learned Gentleman rested was that the clause would only have a minimal effect, if any at all. He was retreating from his earlier statement in which he said that the whole thing was purely psychological, anyhow—a piece of window dressing. My hon. Friend asked, if it was window dressing, why we were wasting our time on it and why the Government were doing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It really is very much more than window dressing, and we have to look at the actual words and make the point once again that it is not what the hon. and learned Gentleman or the right hon. Gentleman say in the Committee; it is what the Act itself will say and how a tribunal may subsequently interpret what is in the Act. It will not be any use an applicant going before the tribunal and saying "Well, I've read the proceedings of the Standing Committee in the House of Commons, and the hon. and learned Gentleman said such and such".

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0870">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>687</span>
What the Act will actually say as compared with the 1978 Act is this. The 1978 Act says that the determination of the question whether the dismissal was fair or unfair shall depend on whether the employer can satisfy the tribunal that he acted reasonably. It will now say that the tribunal considers that the employer acted reasonably or unreasonably. In other words, the employer does not have to say anything at all, and if the applicant is a tongue-tied Cypriot, inarticulate, unable to grasp our language, not supplied with an interpreter, without legal representation, and if he cannot make his case, he will</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having listened to the last debate, I was intrigued to hear so many hon. Members on these Opposition Benches plead for the liberty of the individual. One hon. Gentleman said that the most important thing that could happen is that a person could lose his livelihood. I thought at first that he was speaking to my amendment and pleading throughout for the liberty of the individual. The power of the hon. Member's argument in terms of the liberty of the individual persuaded me to vote for the other amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, therefore, that the power of my argument about the liberty of the individual and the loss of one's livelihood will persuade hon. Gentlemen to support my amendment, though I fear that that is not likely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the closed shop is the essence or the kernel of much of our industrial relations problems at present. It is a nettle that this Committee must grasp, and I hope that the Government will grasp it, too. I do not believe that the Bill as framed in any way grasps that nettle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If something is wrong, one should be prepared to stand up and say so. If a principle is involved in that wrong, whenever the opportunity presents itself one should attempt to alter the principle which one believes to be wrong. I realise that often, if one grasps at nettles, one is liable to be stung, but there are occasions when one must be prepared to be stung if principles are involved. Principles cannot be compromised, and, in the issue of the closed shop, there is a serious principle involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>690</span>
I strongly believe in individual liberty, as I indicated in my opening sentence, provided that that liberty does not interfere with the liberty of any other individual. So I believe in the right of a trade unionist, even an individual, to picket, provided that he pickets peacefully and does not interfere with the rights of others in the process of picketing. I believe in the right of an individual to belong to a trade union, and in the rights of trade unions to run their own affairs. Hence my support of the principle in clause 3 about balloting. It should be left to the trade unions to determine the matter for themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe in the right to belong to a trade union, but I believe equally in the right not to belong to a trade union. That is why I regard the closed shop as incompatible with individual liberty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat that people should have the right to belong to a trade union. If an amendment were tabled giving the right to belong to a trade union—which might have prevented much of the trouble at Grunwick—I make no secret of the fact that I should support it. But it is obnoxious and an infringement of human liberty that a person should be forced to join a union when he has no desire to do so. I am sorry that the Government did not grasp this nettle in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not object to people belonging to a union. On the contrary, I welcome it. The trade union movement of this country has a proud history. If the unions will shake themselves and come into this century instead of living in the last, they will also have a proud future. They should realise that it is as important to protect and preserve jobs as it is to preserve wage levels. These are lessons that some trade unions have not yet learnt. But, to be fair, they have a long history, and I suspect that often their history militates against them rather than assists them. Often it shapes or limits their judgments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be helpful if trade unions were more interested in industrial matters than in party-political matters. That would help industrial relations a great deal. That is not to say that they should not be involved or interested in such matters, but they should keep them in balance and I doubt that some of them do. The trade union movement has a vital part to play in our industrial structure and it must be encouraged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. If they wish to join a trade union, I have not the slightest objection. That is well known to them. As to whether they are members of a trade union, I have no idea. All that I can say is that whenever I have been approached by a trade union to put literature in the factory, I have gladly responded by doing so and making it available to employees. I have agreed that employees may have time to discuss with the trade unions whether they wish to join them, though they themselves decided that they did not even wish to discuss the matter with trade union leaders, let alone join them. But some of them, particularly skilled workers, may well be members of a trade union, for all I know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no objection to their belonging to a trade union. What I object to is people being made to join a union when they do not wish to do so. That is the object of my amendment—that no one should be coerced, pushed or forced to join a union in order to obtain or retain a job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was saying before the interruption that whilst I believe that trade unions have a vital part to play in our industrial structure, and that they should be encouraged, I do not believe that they should have the right to deprive men or women of the employment which they enjoy or seek to enjoy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This amendment in no way means that a company, a factory or a shop could not have 100 per cent. trade union membership. It does not in any way prevent 100 per cent. trade union membership. What it says is that if 100 per cent. of the employees join a trade union, they join it because they want to do so and not because they have to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>692</span>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the difference between the stance that I take on the closed shop and the situation that now exists, and which will continue to exist under the Bill. Of course, it will be more difficult for people to get a closed shop in the future. It will have to be with the agreement of 80 per cent. of those eligible to vote and there will be a provision relating to grounds of conscience. There will be a right to claim for unfair dismissal as a result of a closed shop. All these things will be provided for, but in the end, under the Bill when enacted, the closed shop will remain legal within our industrial structure. What I seek to do is to make it illegal under our industrial structure. That is the object of my amendment.

There is a school of thought—and I make no secret of it—which maintains that closed shops assist management, and that is often the view of management itself. I accept that on occasion a closed shop can help management, but I do not believe that it is the job of the Government to interfere with the liberty of the individual merely to give an easy passage to a few managers who are unable or unwilling to stand up to a situation that may or may not exist within their own factories. I do not think that it necessarily leads to good industrial relations to have a closed shop, but I accept that there are managers who find it easier to manage where there is nobody saying "No" and there is nobody to argue with. Then everybody becomes like military tin soldiers who toe the line when told to do so, because they are all part of a particular organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Frankly, I do not find the argument that the closed shop assists management very convincing. There are many good companies in this country that are managed expertly without closed shops. Although I concede that a closed shop can assist management, on the other hand I contend that there are very good managements which manage without closed shops. Therefore, the issue of the closed shop is not necessarily relevant to good management. Good management happens whether one has a closed shop or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point that requires answering—and which I concede is difficult to answer—is the issue of free riders. I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0873">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>693</span>
understand what free riders are. One of the features that have interested me in all the Committees relating to employment Bills on which I have served since I came to this House in 1972 is the fallacious argument that the only people who can understand trade unions are those who have belonged to a trade union. If that argument is carried to its ultimate conclusion, there are very few matters on which any Member of Parliament would ever be able to speak because his practical experience of so many matters is nil. But, as it happens, I have been a member of a trade union, so I understand the argument about free riders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are arguments that can be advanced against free riders. For example they do not ask the union to represent them in their negotiations. The argument is that free riders get the benefit but they do not pay for those who represent them in obtaining the benefit. But if they have never asked the people obtaining the benefit to represent them, anyway, it is arguable whether in those circumstances it is acceptable that they should be paid to represent them, even though they have not asked them to do so. That is one counter to the free rider argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second is that, if we went through life saying that one must pay for everything from which one derives benefit and equally accepted the alternative of that argument that one does not pay for things from which one does not derive benefit, we should again be in an interesting and intriguing state as a society. For example, I, as a bachelor, would never be called upon to pay any rates for education. That would be a glorious situation for me. I have no children; why should I pay for the education of everyone else's kids? But that is what society is all about, is it not? We participate in a social structure which means that sometimes we pay for benefits which we do not get and on occasions we get benefits for which we do not pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know where there is a civic theatre; I think perhaps Coventry has one. If I went to Coventry and attended the civic theatre, it would be subsidised by the local authority. I would get the benefit of the subsidy as a consequence of going to the theatre, but it would not prevent my
	<span class='label label-info column'>694</span>
going to the theatre, and the citizens of Coventry would be subsidising my seat—or seats, as the case may be—at that theatre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the whole point of this free rider argument: if we really grind it down to its basic level, it becomes absurd. Of course, there will always be a situation in which some people will receive benefits for which others are paying, but I believe that is a fact of life, and I do not believe that it is sufficient to detract from my argument or to say that we as a society should continue to go along the road of the closed shop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if that argument is not acceptable, there is always the final argument. The amendment might be able to be accepted subject to a further amendment to it, namely, that there should be some compulsory deduction from wages, equivalent to the union fee, which would be paid to a charity or similar body, and I would still find that more acceptable than the closed shop principle, though I do not really find it acceptable. But it is something that I would accept if the consequence of accepting it ensured that the closed shop was abolished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point is the position of this country in relation to the EEC. I receive all sorts of letters indicating to me that the European Court of Human Rights is likely to say that the closed shop is incompatible with the Treaty of Rome and is certainly incompatible with human rights. I do not know whether the information I have is correct. I have letters from three people who have appealed and who seem to think that that will be the court's decision. I have other letters from very responsible people indicating that they believe that this will be the attitude of the Court of Human Rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be interesting, at least, to have an assurance from the Minister that, if the Court of Human Rights were to rule that the closed shop was incompatible with human liberty and human rights, the Government in those circumstances would feel compelled to take some action in outlawing the closed shop. Indeed, if the Government can give us any indication of the likely findings of the Court of Human Rights in this matter, it will be extremely interesting to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Gorst</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it really necessary to wait for this judgment? I draw to the notice of the hon. Gentleman the fact that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V001P0I0874">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>695</span>
European Commission Year Book on 3 February 1970 contained a judgment on application No. 4072/69, reaffirming exactly what the position is. It said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is true that the very concept of freedom of association with others also implies freedom not to associate with others, or not to join trade unions."</p></blockquote>
This is already on the European statute book. It is not necessary to wait for further confirmation of this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for his intervention. I confess that I was not aware of that ruling, and the Minister has already said that it was an advantage often not to be a lawyer. I must confess as a humble Back Bench Member of the House of Commons that I have found it extremely difficult to sit on Committees as the lone Member of a party without any legalistic support of any kind trying to understand all the legal arguments that are made and so on. The judgment that the hon. Member has just read is extremely interesting, and I think we are entitled to hear from the Minister exactly what is the Government's reaction to that judgment of 1970. Equally, if the Court of Human Rights is about to deliberate further on this subject, what will be their reaction to that judgment, whatever that judgment may be? I should have thought that the judgment just read out by the hon. Member was some indication of what the judgment was likely to be, but I press very strongly to hear—and I hope to get an assurance—that if the Court of Human Rights were again to support that judgment, the Government themselves would feel compelled to take some action to bring British law into line with judgments of that kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. John Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman accept that we are getting somewhat confused? The statement that the hon. Member for Hendon, North (Mr. Gorst) read was by the European Commission which is not necessarily the judgment of the European Court of Justice. The court he is referring to, the Court of Human Rights, is not an EEC institution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of that. What I am trying to say is that both these areas, the EEC on the one hand—because as I understand it I think we are the only
	<span class='label label-info column'>696</span>
country in Europe where the closed shop is legal—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says "No" but we are certainly one of the very few countries in Europe where the closed shop is legal. It may be that the industrial relations records of some of our competitors in Europe, taking into account their attitude to the closed shop, are not irrelevant to the argument this morning. So I accept that there is a difference between the EEC and the Court of Human Rights. But if both of them were to come out and say that the closed shop was illegal, what, one wonders, would be the attitude of the Government in that respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leighton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman comment on the fact that the 1971 Act, usually referred to by the hon. and learned Gentleman as the "infamous" 1971 Act, gave him very largely what he is now asking for to the extent that pre-entry closed shops were made voids? Would he comment on the fact that although that was legally the case, that has had hardly any effect at all on the existing pre-entry closed shops?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly I will comment. It may have had no effect on the number of closed shops. What matters to me is not whether there are more or fewer closed shops as a consequence of the amendment; what concerns me is the effect it has on the individual in the closed shop. If the closed shop is illegal, the individual has the right to refuse to belong to a trade union. If he chooses not to exercise that right, so be it. In fact, I would applaud his judgment. That is a matter for him. What I am concerned about with this amendment is not in fact reducing the number of closed shops, though I accept that that may be a consequence of it, but of creating a law which ensures that the individual shall legally have the right to say "I do not wish to belong", and no one shall have the right to penalise him for so saying or doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the Government will have the good grace and indeed the courage to accept this amendment. I move it as a matter of principle and repeat that the closed shop in my view is incompatible with individual liberty. A person should have the right to belong to a union, but equally the right not to belong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
