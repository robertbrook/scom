	<p>Has not been moved and cannot therefore be discussed, 135.</p>

	<p>Cannot have two hon. Members on their feet at the same time, 374.</p>

	<p>Committee not to pursue too closely one individual case which the Minister has promised to look into, 456.</p>

	<p>Difficult to give an assurance on a hypothetical question, 433.</p>

	<p>For the Chair to put the Question to the Committee, 557.</p>

	<p>Getting near repetitious argument, 359.</p>

	<p>I can call hon. Members only if they rise, 224.</p>

	<p>Intervention rather long, 57.</p>

	<p>It is for the Chair to decide whether to accept the motion for the adjournment, 144, 147–8.</p>

	<p>Member, Members:</p>

	<p>Should concentrate more on the need for the definition which he proposes in the Bill, 512.</p>

	<p>Should deal only with accepted amendments, 452.</p>

	<p>Should not again go over ground covered during debates on amendments, 451.</p>

	<p>To confine himself to the amendment, 91, 92, 150, 152, 166, 375.</p>

	<p>To relate his remarks more closely to the Clause, 55, 56, 57, 58, 206, 234, 284.</p>

	<p>Nothing that happens elsewhere concerns this Committee at present, 221.</p>

	<p>Pairing is not a matter for the Chair, 181, 184, 197.</p>

	<p>Sedentary interruptions are not permissible, 57.</p>

	<p>The time which elapses before the doors are locked is entirely within the discretion of the Chair, 197.</p>

	<p>There are too many sedentary interruptions, 239.</p>

	<p>There is too much talking going on, 221.</p>
