	<div class='legislation'>Draft Functions of Traffic Wardens (Scotland) Order 1998</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Calum Macdonald)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Functions of Traffic Wardens (Scotland) Order 1998.</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Committee will accept the positive and constructive nature of the order. It has been consulted on widely and we have not received any objections to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be helpful if I give the Committee a brief background to the order. In 1993, the Home Office amended the Functions of Traffic Wardens Order 1970 by the Functions of Traffic Wardens (Amendment) Order 1993 to give new powers to traffic wardens in England and Wales. Following consultation with the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland, it was agreed that the functions of traffic wardens in Scotland should similarly be extended. However, in view of the changes made by the Home Office and the number of changes made to road traffic legislation since the Functions of Traffic Wardens (Scotland) Order 1971 was made, it is necessary completely to remake, rather than simply amend, that order. Today's order therefore brings Scotland into line with England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Traffic wardens already play a significant role in parking enforcement; the order will allow wardens to give greater assistance to the police in the enforcement of parking offences, thereby releasing police time for more essential duties, The order will be available to all Scottish police forces, but it will be up to individual chief constables to decide when to make use of it. I shall explain to the Committee the changes that the order will bring about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Traffic wardens in Scotland at present exercise the following functions: issuing fixed-penalty tickets to vehicles parked in contravention of local parking orders; issuing fixed-penalty tickets to vehicles that do not display a valid excise licence, and directing traffic. All the offences that are dealt with are non-endorsable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order will allow traffic wardens to exercise the following additional functions: First, they can order the interim removal and immobilisation of illegally parked vehicles—powers similar to those currently available to police officers under the Removal and Disposal of Vehicle Regulations 1998, which are being amended in tandem with the order. Secondly, they can issue a fixed-penalty notice for vehicles causing unnecessary obstruction. Thirdly—and for the first time in Scotland—they can issue a fixed-penalty notice for endorsable offences such as dangerously parked
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
vehicles and vehicles parked in breach of pedestrian crossing regulations. Fourthly, they can require the production of a driving licence, and in certain cases, a statement of date of birth, if there is cause to believe that an endorsable offence has been committed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed new functions will provide chief constables in Scotland with the means to increase the role of their traffic warden forces in day-to-day parking enforcement. Police officers will therefore be able to focus on duties of greater priority. However, we and the police recognise the importance of the new duties of traffic wardens being discharged in a proper way. We also consider it essential that they be trained in their new duties. We shall stress the importance of training in the advice that we give to chief constables on the order. We believe that the new arrangements will make a significant contribution and significantly assist the police in carrying out their duties. I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.34 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Letwin 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a very solemn task for Parliament to legislate about matters that are of great concern to many citizens—which traffic wardens and the police are. I therefore approach the regulations with due respect. I have spent much time investigating whether they contain anything that could be deeply offensive to public liberty and civil rights. I must inform the Committee that either I am nearing blindness or the order is well drafted and sensible and the Opposition have no objections to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I must mention to the Minister that the schedule contains a slight tactical error in its first line. It states that we should
	<br><blockquote><p>"enforce the law with respect of.</p></blockquote>
That phrase does not work in the English language. Nor would it, I suspect, in Scotland. If the Minister is willing to accept an amendment that would substitute the word "of with the word "to", or the word "with" with the word "in", the syntax would be rescued and the entire order would be acceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Gorrie 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Liberal Democrats support the general thrust of the regulations, and I have consulted the police, who also support them. Given that Edinburgh, for example, has "green ways" to ensure that buses run more smoothly, it is sensible to allow traffic wardens to deal with cars that are parked in places where they should not park.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One aspect of the order that could lead to problems is the powers given to traffic wardens to ask for driving licences or for the age and identity of drivers. I understand why that must be done, and was reassured when the Minister said that traffic wardens will receive training for it. However, an effort should be made to inform the public more clearly that such a rule will not apply to all activities, but that it will be focused only on those mentioned in the order, such as dangerous driving. Publicity would help the situation, because I can imagine the confrontation that would arise between a slightly abrasive traffic warden and a rather
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0194">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
dour Edinburgh lady in a motor car when he asks for her date of birth. It could be the start of the third world war, which is something that we must avoid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order could give rise to a slippery slope into civil liberties issues, so we must be aware of the problems that could arise. The power must be tightly controlled; we must ensure that traffic wardens are trained properly, and that the public are informed of the limits of the order. Given that the power is new, and that people may be a little askance at being asked for their driving licence by a traffic warden, publicity about the matter would help. Other than those reservations, we welcome the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.37 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Jackson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wantage)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the context of the order, will the Minister consider a suggestion in relation to the British and, in future, the Scottish taxpayer? Traffic wardens impose fines; traffic wardens are expensive to run. It has been asked whether some of the income generated from fines for traffic offences should be used to pay for the enforcement of the duties of traffic wardens. That has come to my attention, particularly in the context of speed cameras in my constituency. My local police are anxious for more speed cameras, but cannot afford them. Income generated from traffic fines should be used to sustain the network of speed cameras. The matter is being considered by the Home Office and seems eminently sensible. Has the Scottish Office considered it? Is it willing to make representations to the Home Office and the Treasury in order to speed up the review and reach a positive conclusion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.38 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the final remarks of the hon. Member for Wantage (Mr. Jackson). The chief constable of Grampian police has also raised the issue. I think that members of the public believe that fines go towards the maintenance of those fining them. They are probably not aware that that money goes back into the Government's coffers. Will the Minister consider that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that there has been widespread consultation on the matter. It would not be that onerous a task to append a list of consultees to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
order. It would assist the Committee to know, first, who had been consulted, thus avoiding going round the houses doing the same thing again and, secondly, to ensure that nobody had been missed out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Just to clarify matters: the order provides that traffic wardens may be employed to enforce the law, but whether they can do so will be up to the individual chief constables, who will decide how to deploy them. Traffic wardens who have been trained will have the power; it is not a general power that all traffic wardens on duty can exercise. They must be trained first.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.40 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to members of the Committee for their constructive points. I shall go through them one by one; some I shall just have to take on board, such as the point on syntax. It may not be English, but it might be legalese. The order has still to go to the House of Lords, but I shall certainly consider the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully take the point of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Gorrie) about the need for public information. The power is new in Scotland. Although it has been exercised already in England and Wales, I would not want to cause any explosions in Marchmont or elsewhere in Edinburgh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I undertake to consider the point made by the hon. Member for Wantage. I know that police authorities always want more speed cameras, and it is one of the areas that we have looked at closely. We are trying to make extra provision for them and to target the areas where they are most needed. The suggestion made by the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir Robert Smith) to append a list of consultees to documents is sensible. I shall try to provide that, and perhaps suggest to those who handle such matters that it would be useful for Committees to have such material in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be up to individual chief constables to decide whether to ask traffic wardens to exercise these functions, and we shall be issuing guidance on the need for training before they are exercised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>

	<p>
	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Functions of Traffic Wardens (Scotland) Order 1998.</p></blockquote>
