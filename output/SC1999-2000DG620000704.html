	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for Competitiveness (Mr. Alan Johnson)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft National Minimum Wage Regulations 1999 (Amendment) Regulations 2000.</p></blockquote>
Let me say, Mr. O'Brien, how pleased I am to be on my first Standing Committee under your chairmanship. I am happy to appear before hon. Members again to present further important changes to national minimum wage regulations. It is only a few weeks since I debated the increase in the rate for young people in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As hon. Members will know, we asked the independent Low Pay Commission to monitor the effect of introducing the national minimum wage during its first few months in operation and to report its findings to us. The report and the Government's responses to it were published on 15 February.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is only a short time since I was pontificating on the youth rate, and we have a lot to get through, so I shall resist the temptation to repeat myself. However, I hope that hon. Members will forgive me if I mention once more that the minimum wage policy has benefited more than 1.5 million workers and their families—with no detrimental effect on the economy, jobs or employment. Indeed, there have been more people in employment than ever before since the minimum wage took effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will be aware that both the Low Pay Commission's main reports made a number of recommendations. In our response to the first report, which was published back in 1998, we introduced the youth rate at a lower level than that recommended by the commission, but said that we would increase it to the recommended £3.20 an hour in June 2000. We debated that increase in May, and the new hourly rate took effect on 1 June. Today, we are debating the increase to the main minimum wage rate, the recommendations of the second report and the changes that are needed to implement them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In its first report, the commission advised that the main rate of the minimum wage should be raised from £3.60 to £3.70 an hour in June 2000. The Government duly introduced the rate at £3.60, but decided that it would be prudent to wait for the Low Pay Commission's second report to be published and to see the effects of the new law once it had been established before deciding on the 10p increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
When we published the Low Pay Commission's second report in February, we announced that, in view of its positive findings and the fact that the economy was operating well, we would indeed increase the main minimum wage rate from £3.60 to £3.70 an hour. We delayed the timing of the change to allow businesses plenty of time to prepare. Awareness of the needs of business has been a key reason why the minimum wage has been brought in so smoothly and successfully, and we intend to stick to that approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The announcement that we would increase the national minimum wage rate was made on 15 February and received wide coverage in the media. Since then, we have included information about the increase in the Inland Revenue's April newsletter, which went to all 1.2 million tax-registered employers, and we have written to bodies that represent both workers and employers. We will provide more information about the increase in the Inland Revenue's September newsletter. The May and June newspaper campaign on the youth rate also mentioned the pending increase in the adult rate. A substantial publicity campaign will be launched in September or October, including coverage on television, to ensure that workers are aware of their rights and that employers know their obligations under the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Low Pay Commission's second report was positive. Its recommendations covered publicity, enforcement, guidance and clarification of regulations in specific areas, with which I will deal in a moment. The Government accepted all 16 of the Low Pay Commission's operational recommendations and suggestions, subject to the usual detailed consideration of practicality and resources. We were not entirely convinced by the argument for changing the treatment of 21-year-olds so that they received the main adult rate for the minimum wage. We have asked the Low Pay Commission to reconsider the matter and to refer to it in its next report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today, we are debating the increase in the main rate of the national minimum wage and several other regulatory changes recommended in the Low Pay Commission report. There were three specific recommendations: to extend the modern apprenticeship one-year exemption to cover national traineeships; to extend the sandwich student exemption beyond undergraduates to cover postgraduates who are required to take a work placement as part of their course; and to tidy up regulations on travel time and stand-by time to ensure that they meet the policy objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will briefly explain to the Committee how the regulations will work. Regulation 3 fulfils the Government's commitment to raising the main rate of the minimum wage from £3.60 to £3.70 an hour. I have explained our reasons for making that change, and going ahead with the increase shows our determination not to allow this important policy to wither on the vine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0055">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Regulation 4 deals with people in training and education. The first part addresses an anomaly identified by the Low Pay Commission. It relates to young people in England and Wales on national traineeship schemes and to people in Scotland and Northern Ireland on equivalent schemes. As the commission noted in its report, such training is in essence the same as the modern apprenticeship, except that it leads to a national vocational qualification at level 2 rather than level 3. Modern apprentices under 26 are already exempt from the minimum wage in their first year, and the difference in treatment came about only because national traineeships were too new for the commission to consider properly in its first report. We are also applying the exemption to people on similar schemes in Scotland and Northern Ireland; such schemes are known as skillseekers and jobskills respectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulatory impact assessment identifies 20,000 trainees who will be affected by the change. Some trainees who currently receive the minimum wage will no longer be entitled to it under this legislation. However, they will continue to be entitled to whatever pay is set out in their contracts, which should be changed only with the agreement of both parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second part of regulation 4 applies an exemption for sandwich students—a magnificent name for them. Current regulations provide that undergraduate students and trainee teachers do not have to be paid the minimum wage for any work that they do when placed with an employer as part of their course. The commission recommended extending the exemption to postgraduates; otherwise, their prospects of finding suitable placements would be reduced. There is some evidence to suggest that employers have opted to provide placements to undergraduates rather than postgraduates. The change is likely to affect only a few hundred people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The commission also recommended that, if feasible, we should provide a similar exemption for students who work in this country but study at universities in the rest of Europe. We have carefully considered the practicalities, but our lawyers have advised us that such an exemption would be highly impractical and virtually impossible to define and qualify. The exemption is therefore limited to students studying at United Kingdom universities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those provisions underscore the Government's commitment to training and education. We want the right training targeted at the right people and to correct any small anomalies that are caused by the way in which the regulations were first drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulations 6, 7 and 9 concern several more detailed and esoteric issues that have come to the attention of the LPC and Government during the first year of the national minimum wage. Regulation 6 is important because it concerns the way in which the rules operate as regards travel time for those required to move
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
between assignments during the working day. Some employers felt that the existing provisions were ambiguous, so we are making the position absolutely clear: such travel time counts as work and must be paid at minimum wage rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another amendment improves the way that the rules operate for those on so-called zero-hours contracts, who are permitted to go home while on call, but may instead choose to go elsewhere, and for those who are allowed to sleep at work while on call.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final change deals with a minor difficulty with the application of the regulations to those who are responsible for submitting their own time sheets for some of their work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, there are one or two purely technical regulations designed to ensure that the amendments are placed correctly into the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are keen to build on the success of the minimum wage's first year. We will ensure that it continues to provide adequate protection for lower-paid workers. As hon. Members will know, the Government have asked the Low Pay Commission to prepare a third report by July 2001. We are asking it to continue to monitor and evaluate the impact of the minimum wage, and to make further recommendations on the rate. In particular, we have asked it to consider movements in earnings this time round. That does not mean that we are proposing an automatic link between earnings and the national minimum wage; we have always seen great problems with any formulaic approach to setting the level of the minimum wage. We believe that to use earnings or cost-of-living indices alone would be to take far too narrow a perspective. Before arriving at its conclusions, the commission will also take account of such factors as competitiveness, employment and the impact on particular groups of people such as young people and women, and on different sectors of the economy, especially small firms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We expect that any increase in the minimum wage that the Low Pay Commission recommends can be put into effect in autumn 2001. It will take several years to assess the full impact of the national minimum wage, and in the meantime we have every intention of proceeding with caution. Despite its very successful introduction, we need to remember that the minimum wage is still in its infancy. It is a very powerful instrument of policy that affects millions of people's jobs and livelihoods. Caution and the avoidance of risk are therefore crucial. We must not put at risk the jobs of those whom we seek to protect, nor place unnecessary burdens on business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The minimum wage, which many of us believed should have been introduced much earlier, was introduced in this country only just in time for the 21st century. We are not going to put at risk its continued success and general acceptance by employers and employees alike by abandoning our careful approach. The amendments make sound and sensible improvements to the law. I hope that they will not be the cause of dissent among hon. Members this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.42 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Gibb 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bognor Regis and Littlehampton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you and the Minister, Mr. O'Brien.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has always been my conviction that those who work hard eight hours a day, five days a week should receive from their employers enough money at least to pay the rent and feed and clothe themselves. That is the just society that Conservatives have always aimed to secure, and I am sure that many Labour Members take the same view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where the views of the two parties diverged was on how best to achieve that goal. Conservatives were concerned about the passing of a raft of rules and regulations that would set a minimum wage at a level that lost people their jobs. In the end, the Government introduced a minimum wage of £3.60 an hour, way below the figure cited by the press and trade union leaders. On the evidence to date, that rate has not had a significant impact on jobs, although we need to see the effect over a longer time to be certain. Given that outcome, we are much less anxious about the effect of the national minimum wage than we were, and, consequently, we will not repeal it when we come to office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new regulations increase the rate by 10p from £3.60 to £3.70, as recommended by the Low Pay Commission, which is an increase of 2.77 per cent. Pensioners were awarded a rise of 1.1 per cent. by the Chancellor. Will the Minister explain why pensioners, many of whom could easily be described as low paid, are being given only 1.1 per cent., when the national minimum wage is set to rise by 2.77 per cent.? Is there one law for private employers and another for the Government? Does he think that pensioners should ask the Low Pay Commission, rather than the Chancellor, to review their annual increase?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would also like the Minister to set out the Government's policy on future upratings. Does the policy as stated by the Secretary of State, who has instructed the Low Pay Commission to include earnings growth in its assessments, imply a link between increases in the national minimum wage and earnings? If so, why does the Secretary of State oppose increasing it annually? The Low Pay Commission said in the report cited by the Minister:
	<br><blockquote><p>Many small businesses told us that they would prefer to manage predictable upratings with small, regular increases rather than larger ad hoc increases.</p></blockquote>
However, the Secretary of State told the Select Committee on Trade and Industry that there was no requirement for the minimum wage to be revised every year. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>The reason why we believe that uprating annually is wrong is that this is not a benefit, it is a pay increase.</p></blockquote>
A little clarification of those points would be helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 2 amends the definition of a worker in the original regulation 2 by adding a reference to regulation 12(3) of the 1999 regulations. Before the amendment, principal regulation 2 read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"worker" has the same meaning as in section 54(3) of the Act but, except in paragraph (6) of regulation 12, includes in addition

	<ol>

	<li>an agency worker…</li>

	<li>a home worker.</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
After the statutory instrument has been passed, it will read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"worker" has the same meaning as in section 54(3) of the Act but, except in paragraphs (3) and (6) of regulation 12, includes in addition

	<ol>

	<li>an agency worker…</li>

	<li>a home worker.</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
Well, that is as clear as mud. The Act and the regulations are perhaps not as straightforward as they should be. Perhaps the Minister will explain them in layman's terms for the benefit of the Committee. The regulatory impact assessment says that regulation 2 simply clarifies technical legal points. Well, it would say that wouldn't it? A whole nest of controversy often lies hidden behind such anodyne phrases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I confess to being slightly baffled by regulation 12 of the original regulations, which regulation 4 amends. Paragraph 2(b) of regulation 12 says that a worker who
	<br><blockquote><p>is employed under a contract of apprenticeship or, in accordance with paragraph (3), is to be treated as employed under a contract of apprenticeship</p></blockquote>
does not qualify for the national minimum wage. Paragraph 3 then defines what it is meant by
	<br><blockquote><p>treated as employed under a contract of apprenticeship</p></blockquote>
for the purposes of paragraph 2(b). What was the difference in the 1999 regulations between being employed under a contract of apprenticeship and being treated as employed under a contract of apprenticeship by virtue of paragraph 3?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order changes the definition in paragraph 3, which previously said:
	<br><blockquote><p>A worker is to be treated as employed under a contract of apprenticeship for the purposes of paragraph (2)(b) if, and only if, he is engaged under the arrangements made by the Government known as Modern Apprenticeships.</p></blockquote>
The new wording refers to "a person" who
	<br><blockquote><p>is to be treated for the purposes of paragraph (2)(b) as a worker who is employed under a contract of apprenticeship.</p></blockquote>
The wording has changed subtly, and I am keen to know why. Previously, paragraph 3 defined being treated as employed under a contract of apprenticeship, but now it defines being employed under a contract of apprenticeship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not dancing on the head of a pin. I am concerned that under the original regulations, apprenticeships not under Government schemes could qualify for exemption, whereas now they will not. Is that interpretation correct? That refers back to my earlier question about the either/ors in the original regulation 12(2)(b). Will the Minister clarify that point?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principal purpose of regulation 4 is to extend the exemption that applies to modern apprenticeships to national traineeships, the foundation modern apprenticeships and advanced modern apprenticeships. That makes sense. In the words of the Low Pay Commission:
	<br><blockquote><p>In essence this training is the same as a Modern Apprenticeship, although leading to NVQ level 2 rather than level 3.</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0057">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
Regulation 4(3) simplifies regulation 12(8) of the original principal regulations, to exempt all students who work for a year as part of their course from the national minimum wage. Clearly, that makes sense, as the LPC said:
	<br><blockquote><p>The requirement for students who undertake a placement with an employer as part of a postgraduate course to be paid the minimum wage is anomalous and may damage students' prospects of finding suitable placements. Employers with budgetary constraints may opt to provide placements to undergraduates instead.</p></blockquote>
That begs the question of why the Government made the distinction in the first place. Perhaps the Minister could hazard a guess and inform the Committee about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister explain the anomaly in regulation 6 relating to zero-hours contracts that new paragraphs (1) and (1A) of principal regulation 15 seek to amend? How will the change from the original wording remedy it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a pedantic note, will the Minister also explain why regulation 6 has a regulation 6(1) but no further paragraphs? The same point seems to apply to regulation 7, which has a paragraph (1) but no paragraph (2) or beyond. Life is complicated enough without unnecessary numbering confusion. On a similar point, regulation 8 seems to clear up some poor drafting in the original regulation 22. Will the Minister say how many representations he received, and from whom, pointing out the error? It may be just a drafting error, but these regulations and the way in which they tie in to the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 are terribly complicated, and simple drafting errors such as the reference to regulation 21 as regulation 22 can cause many wasted hours for advisers and businesses trying their best to implement them.

Regulation 9 concerns employees who are required to submit monthly time sheets. The new regulation 29A makes it clear that if an employee fails to submit a time sheet, those hours shall be excluded from the national minimum wage calculation. I spent 13 years at KPMG submitting time sheets; struggling to remember which clients needed to be allocated each tenth of an hour of the month's 140 hours was a month-end nightmare. Even now, I become twitchy as the end of the month approaches. I am reminded of the lawyer who died at the age of 30 and protested to St. Peter that he was too young to die. St. Peter replied that according to the total hours charged on his time sheets, he was actually 96.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is sensible that if time sheets are not submitted, the hours will not be included in any national minimum wage calculation. As with most regulations, problems are often contained in the detail. I hope, therefore, to receive full responses to my questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I could answer those clear, concise questions immediately, I would first like to deal with the important principle articulated by the Opposition. The Conservatives have apparently always believed that people should be paid properly. That must explain why they abandoned the wages councils and gave people the right to pay hairdressers less than £2.20 an hour. However, we know about one change in Conservative policy, because the policy forum known as the shadow Chancellor, in deciding what he will say before Treasury questions, has already let us know that the minimum wage is now acceptable to the Conservative party. I was pleased to hear the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton say that if the Conservative party ever has another opportunity to be in government, it will not repeal the minimum wage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What was not mentioned, though we have heard it from various quarters, is that the Conservatives would exempt small firms. In the absence of any intervention on that, we can assume that that is the case. Although theirs is not wholehearted support for the minimum wage, it is nevertheless encouraging to know that at last, the Conservative party, like every other right-of-centre mainstream party in Europe and, indeed, most of the world, accepts the principle of basic, decent, civilised minimum standards in the workplace. That is good news.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot hear the Liberal Democrat view because there is no one here to express it, but while we have had the opportunity to record the fact that the Conservative party has recanted its views on the minimum wage, it might be as well to record that we are pleased that the Liberal Democrats have also changed their policy. We are informed by the 
	<i>Financial Times</i> that they have ditched their support for regional variations in the national minimum wage after deciding that it was economically illiterate and politically inept. That sums up the Liberal Democrat manifesto at the last general election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In short, there is good news all round as people realise that the minimum wage is not the threat that it was perceived to be. Civilisation did not end on 1 April 1999 and society as we know it did not collapse. Not only has the minimum wage increased, but its effects have not fed through to prices as we were told that they would: price rises are at their lowest for 36 years. The minimum wage has not seeped into the unemployment figures: more people—27 million of them—are employed than ever before. Finally, the Economist Intelligence Unit ranks the UK second in the world for its business environment, despite the Opposition's prediction that the introduction of minimum standards at work would have disastrous effects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was pleased to hear you make your point about pensions, Mr. O'Brien. It was an unfair comparison to make, but it allows me to move on to the issue of future increases. We do not believe that a mechanistic approach to the minimum wage would serve the people who depend most on those minimum standards. The best way to proceed is through the Low Pay Commission. The hon. Member for Bognor Regis
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0058">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
and Littlehampton referred to our alteration of its terms of reference as indicating a policy change. All that we have said is that the Low Pay Commission, in reporting back to us by July 2001, should take into account movements in earnings. That has been misinterpreted in some quarters as asking it to come up with some formula. This is not a going rate; we are talking about a minimum standard—a safety net that no one can drop through. We do not say that £3.60 an hour, or £3.70 from 1 October, is a going rate, and nor is it a benefit. Benefits clearly need periodical uprating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Approaches to the issue vary around the world. Some countries raise the minimum wage every three weeks while others raise it every seven years. The best approach, in an environment where the minimum wage still has to be properly established, is to ask the Low Pay Commission to consider all the factors, including movement in earnings. How can it decide what the level of the minimum wage ought to be, without looking at movement in earnings? We are not changing our cautious approach on this issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about the definition of workers. I hope that I have the answer at my fingertips. I know from our work together on the Finance Bill Committee that he is attentive to detail, and I do not criticise him for that. I assure him that there is nothing suspicious about these changes. I can write to him with chapter and verse, but I shall address his point about national trainees who will now be included along with those on modern apprenticeships. All those on modern apprenticeship schemes are employed; some people on national trainee schemes and their equivalents in Northern Ireland and Scotland are not employed. If we did not change the definition, those who are not employed would be eligible for the minimum wage when the whole point of the Low Pay Commission's recommendation is that they should be taken out of it and dealt with in the same way as people on modern apprenticeships. Modern apprentices are employed, but some national trainees are not. Extending the exemption has meant that we have had to make this refinement to the definition of "worker". I shall write to hon. Members on all those points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several points of detail on the drafting were raised. I was asked how representations were received. The Conservative party cannot argue on the policy, so it picks at details. We have nothing to hide in the details, and I am happy to write to hon. Members on such points. We do not need representations to correct technical details, but I will probably need to correct whatever I may have failed to make clear. I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would let me write to him on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have covered the hon. Gentleman's points about the treatment of apprentices sufficiently. The other points were more substantive because they relate to the zero hours situation and time sheets. The policy on zero hours is for the national minimum wage to be paid to people who are required to be at or near their place
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
of work. It stems from the famous case involving, I think, a chain of hamburger stores where someone was on the premises for about 14 hours but was paid for only four. The regulations rightly seek to deal with that problem. Without them, bad employers would force people to wait around without being paid while they were not working but were unable to do anything else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not enough to include people at work, because they could be asked to wait outside the premises. Unscrupulous employers could ask them to wait in the tea shop across the road. That would leave a fault in the scheme. The Low Pay Commission has examined cases where firms allow workers the freedom to go home or elsewhere. The change is intended to clarify the law so that people with the freedom to go home if they want to are not legally entitled to the national minimum wage. That is particularly important for people who live close to the premises where they work. This measure seeks to resolve that technical detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point about time sheets and the solicitor who died at 30 has some relevance for me. In my days as a post office union official, I was told that although the normal retirement age was 60, people had worked much overtime because of postman recruitment problems, and that, as they had worked double shifts, they should have been entitled to retire at 40 because they had completed their years of service. It is a similar problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The legislation makes it clear that the employer cannot be responsible for people who have not submitted their time sheets within the pay period. However, as the law stands, the employer not only, rightly, has a get-out in respect of that part of the payment, but there is a suggestion that the employee is not entitled to any payment when some money could be paid where work was not dependent on time sheets. We want to close that loophole so that while employees may not be paid for the work on the time sheets that they failed to submit, they would be paid for other elements of work that do not depend on time sheets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will write to the hon. Gentleman on any points of detail. It is encouraging that the national minimum wage is being accepted. Arguments about its rate or 21-year-olds and the youth rate are valid, but only in a context in which the national minimum wage is accepted. The trade union movement in Britain, unlike that in the rest of Europe, opposed it in the 1970s. I wore flares and a tank top and went to the TUC conference every year, where we worried about differentials. The fact that the principle is being accepted, which was evident from this debate, is a step forward for low-paid workers.
