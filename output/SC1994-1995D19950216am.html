	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Milburn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that we do not stretch your vocal cords too much in the course of today's proceedings, Mr. Winterton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In discussing the amendments, I hope that the Committee has the opportunity to explore some of the issues surrounding the enterprise investment scheme. Amendments Nos. 179 and 181 best highlight the differences between the approaches of the Opposition and the Government to how best to deliver an agreed principle: the need to improve investment in small and medium-sized enterprises and unquoted companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a special interest in the subject as, prior to coming to this House, I worked in the economic development sector for a local authority on Tyneside, seeking to provide assistance to small and growing firms. One of the issues that continually came to my attention—and to the attention of other hon. Members who have worked in that field, most notably, my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, West (Mr. Pearson)—was the shortage of investment capital for companies that were starting up or growing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is obvious that small and medium-sized companies are the growth sector of the economy, in terms of both output and future job creation, but such companies encounter difficulties in raising finance. The enterprise investment scheme that was introduced last year was intended to bridge that investment gap. The then Chief Secretary to the Treasury who, as we speak, may be facing a dressing-down from the Prime Minister and the Cabinet—our sympathies are with him—and whose ghost continues to stalk the Committee, said last year during the debate on the enterprise investment scheme that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The purpose of the provision is to recognise that unquoted trading companies can often face considerable difficulties in raising
	<span class='label label-info column'>296</span>
relatively small amounts of share capital. The new scheme is intended to provide a well-targeted means for some of those problems to be overcome."</p></blockquote>
He went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The EIS will be targeted specifically at trading companies and relief will not be available for investment in companies providing private rented housing."—
	<i>[Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 22 March 1994; 
	<i>c.</i> 773.]</p></blockquote>
We have some concerns about clause 60 which are reflected in the amendments. Amendments Nos. 180 and 182 will allow us to probe the Government's intentions in relaxing the operation of the enterprise investment scheme. We fear that the Government are, once again, emphasising the needs of property-backed companies, rather than manufacturing companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As stated last year, the intention behind the enterprise investment scheme was to provide a targeted incentive for new equity investment by individuals in unquoted companies and, in particular, to encourage business angels—outside investors—to become involved, not only in terms of investment, but by lending their expertise and management skills to the company involved. That objective was to be achieved by enabling outside investors to take an active role in management as paid directors without losing any entitlement to relief. To that end, many forms of tax relief were made available under the EIS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the major concerns expressed in Committee last year—which we still have—related to the scattergun approach to investment adopted by the EIS and whether such tax incentives provided the best means of levering in investment to those small and medium-sized enterprises in most need of it. I am thinking in particular of fledgling companies with potential for growth in the high-tech manufacturing sector. Although their need for additional financial assistance is proved time and time again both anecdotally and statistically, they have some difficulties in acquiring it. Those concerns from last year have been heightened by the proposals in this and subsequent clauses to make the EIS even less targeted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 60 provides for the abolition of two safeguards which were deemed necessary—indeed, they were reinforced—in last year's Finance Bill: the parallel trades rule and the interests in land rule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The existing parallel trades rule denies relief for investment in a company to an individual who is part of a group which controls that company or is involved in another business carrying out a broadly similar trade. That provision was one of the five main safeguards when the enterprise investment scheme was introduced last year and it is a useful anti-avoidance measure intended to prevent people from investing in a business with which they have very close links and from obtaining new relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government now propose to abolish the rule after it has been in operation for only one year. I hope that the Financial Secretary will be able to tell us why the Government have deemed it necessary to get rid of that rule having made it central to the EIS last year. Was last year's Bill badly drafted or was it another case of the Government rushing hastily into a piece of ill-thought-out legislation without having consulted fully those who were deemed to benefit from it? If pressure is being brought to bear on the Government to abolish the rule, will the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0674">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>297</span>
Financial Secretary tell us the sources of that pressure? Will he also tell us the costs to the Exchequer of the abolition and explain the Government's thinking on loosening EIS provisions more generally in future?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendments reflect our concerns about the further relaxation of the rules governing the enterprise investment scheme. In amendment No. 180 we suggest a different approach to targeting investment at particular groups of unquoted companies. Rather than giving a blanket relaxation of the rules, as the clause proposes, we seek to use the EIS to develop particular sectors of the economy where assistance is most needed by using existing taxation provisions. We have highlighted two areas in particular: certain parts of the film trade and those companies engaged in research and development, which is regarded by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee as vital for the future development of the British economy. It is particularly important for small and medium-sized enterprises, which tend to be less risk averse than some of the larger companies, which are more likely to research and develop new product lines. It would benefit the economy if assistance could be targeted on those companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 182 deals with land interests. The amendments are probing amendments, and are designed to flush out the Government's intentions about the future of the enterprise investment scheme. The Government should have adopted the approach that is outlined in amendment No. 180. The Government could have used existing tax provisions to target help more accurately on where it is most needed. Instead, they have decided to relax the operation of the EIS. That is the clearest in the Government's proposed changes to the interests in land rule. Amendments Nos. 179 and 181 would prevent the abolition of the parallel trades rule and of the interests in land rule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition are worried about the abolition of the parallel trades rule, and about what that reveals of the Government's intentions. However, we are more worried about the interests in land rule. The current rule prevents relief being given if more than half of the value of a company's assets is represented by land and buildings. If the rule were broken, the investor would lose relief. Clause 60 will abolish that rule. To some of the more cynical members of the Committee, that sounds like we are harking back to the bad old days of the business expansion scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The initial purpose of the business expansion scheme became perverted, and its investment benefits became skewed towards property-backed companies. I shall give some figures: none of the BES companies was in rented housing during 1987–88, but 59 per cent. of companies and 95 per cent. of the amount invested, were in private rented housing for the year 1992–93. The clause does not stipulate that the EIS can be used for the benefit of companies working in housing, but it will bring the return of property-based investment companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members and many Conservative Members are worried that the little help that is available will be targeted to the British manufacturing sector. No wonder manufacturing under the BES lost out. The Inland Revenue's statistics show that in 1987–88, 35 per cent. of companies and 14 per cent. of total value was invested in
	<span class='label label-info column'>298</span>
manufacturing companies, but by 1992–93, 13 per cent. of companies and just 2 per cent. of the value was invested in manufacturing. The value of investment in manufacturing under the BES fell from £28 million to £22 million over that period. The BES has not been a success story in the manufacturing sector of the economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the background to the BES and the EIS, I should like to ask the Financial Secretary some questions about the relaxation of the interests in land rule. First, will he confirm that the rule was initially introduced to prevent the abuse of the scheme by those who set up assets of property-backed schemes to provide lower-risk, tax-enhanced investments? Secondly, if the Financial Secretary says that there is a problem with the 50 per cent. rule—I understand many assets of small companies are tied up in land or buildings—instead of removing the entire restriction, why not merely vary the percentage of assets held in land or buildings? He has the power to do that by order and does not even have to introduce such a proposal in the Bill. What representations has the Financial Secretary received on the issue? From where is pressure coming?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, what sort of schemes will the abolition of the interests on land rule facilitate that would not previously have benefited under the enterprise investment sheme?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The concerns felt about that matter are not only felt by Labour Members. I quote from the 
	<i>Small Company Investor,</i> which comments on the provisions in clause 60 and subsequent clauses on the enterprise investment scheme:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Our bet is that there will be an avalanche of lower-risk property-backed schemes taking money away from entrepreneurial small companies."</p></blockquote>
"Tax Shelter Report" observes that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Investors should expect to see a number of asset backed companies seeking funds, particularly property development companies."</p></blockquote>
Why have not the Government taken the opportunity to focus any available relief on companies which need the funds and are vital to the future development of the British economy? I am particularly thinking of small and medium-sized, high-tech companies in the manufacturing or research and development sectors. Such companies face a problem from the provisions in the clause and subsequent proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government do not focus the relief, such companies face a double whammy, First, they already have difficulties in raising finance in competition with property-backed businesses—investors tend to go for easy, safe investments. Secondly, their problems will be made worse if the property-backed business can not only raise finance, but can do so with a subsidy from the taxpayer. That makes clause 60 a particular cause for concern. Last year, the enterprise investment scheme was nodded through the Committee without a Division. We asked for assurances and some were given, although they seem to have altered in that 12-month period. When the Financial Secretary responds, will he offer all members of the Committee who are concerned about future development of the manufacturing sector, real assurances about the Government's intentions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. John Butterfill 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bournemouth, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I should remind hon. Members that I advise the British Venture Capital Association, as is shown in the Register of Members' Interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have much sympathy with some points made by the hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn). There is concern that the relaxation in the clause, especially in relation to interests in land, could produce undesirable results as regards the direction of investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would not go as far as supporting the hon. Gentleman's amendment or that in the name of his hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith), as problems arose from the old interests in land rule that impacted unreasonably on genuine trading companies, many of which were manufacturing companies, with substantial assets inland. They were prevented by that rigid rule from benefiting from the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said when we debated clause 64 on the Floor of the House—it involved similar principles—we need more flexibility. However, there is legitimate concern that the relaxations that we are making now could lead to an undesirable concentration of investment funds in relatively safe, low-risk schemes which are essentially property backed. When I raised that concern in the debate on clause 64, my hon. Friend the Minister assured me that, in the case of venture capital trusts, a power under schedule 14 enables regulations to be made through which the Revenue can, at any time, clamp down on the undesirable concentration of investment in property-backed schemes. To some extent I found that reassuring, but can my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to the Treasury say whether similar protection exists in the Bill in relation to an abuse in an EIS?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would prefer to give the Revenue discretion to consider individual schemes when it believes that the primary purpose of the schemes is low-risk tax avoidance rather than high-risk investment in a desirable manufacturing business or other commercial activity. The Revenue would be able to refuse approval at its discretion. That would be simpler than removing the allowance completely, which would adversely affect legitimate companies. A rigid formula would also exclude those companies that all members of the Committee want to benefit from such schemes. I hope that, on reflection, the Government will consider, as I suggested in the debate on clause 64, introducing an amendment on Report to give that discretion to the Inland Revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Inland Revenue does not like that sort of discretion because it does not enjoy making up the rules, but prefers rigid rules. But we are giving substantial concessions and it is necessary, if we want to achieve the objective which is shared on both sides of the Committee, to give that discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I detect a certain imbalance in tax treatments between an EIS and a VCT scheme. If an investor brings a rolled-over gain into an EIS and the EIS fails, he is able to offset his loss against the capital gains liability that he would otherwise incur. That does not happen with VCTs. Perhaps we can explore that when we discuss later clauses, but it is worth making that point now, as we consider enterprise investment schemes. We all want to encourage people to enter into what are often high-risk investments where the benefit to the economy, to employment and to communities is great. We are giving
	<span class='label label-info column'>300</span>
those concessions to encourage people, but at the same time we must ensure that they are not misused. I look forward to hearing my right hon. Friend's response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Shaw 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dover)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should, as previous members of the Committee have done, declare my personal interest. I have been involved in the business expansion scheme and am currently a director of a business expansion scheme company. I have taken considerable interest in small companies. The business with which I was involved before coming to Parliament was an active investor in small companies. In addition, over the years I have lobbied—not in a paid or officially connected capacity—on behalf of the BES association, a small association of individuals with small business ventures who have struggled along with the business expansion scheme legislation. Although we managed to achieve some small changes to that legislation, with a view to improving the lot of genuine trading companies and improving opportunities for genuine manufacturing companies, it was with mixed feelings that the BES association saw the business expansion scheme extended to residential property. We had a shortage of rented accommodation in this country and many thousands of rented accommodation units were provided efficiently and effectively. However, it had the disadvantage, which has already been mentioned, that attention was taken away from the legitimate, struggling, small manufacturing company or even from the legitimate, small, struggling, high technology company that I am sure members of the Committee would want to help. I regard the enterprise investment scheme with those mixed feelings and, although I am not retained by or have an official connection with the EIS association, which is the successor body to the BES, I listen carefully to what it says.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must ensure that small companies receive help and that they receive that help in a sensible way which does not impose too many restrictions or petty regulations. At the same time, we must recognise that it is not the business of the House massively to expand the world of property investment or property development. The problem of small firms was identified by the Bolton committee in the 1960s. I think that the problem had been recognised before that, but mere had not been a committee to produce a report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsequently, I was privileged in my capacity as a chartered accountant with Coopers and Lybrand to work on the Wilson committee investigation of the 1970s, when we discovered that, for the large public company quoted on the stock market, there was no shortage of investment capital provided that it produced good business propositions. However, there is always a shortage of investment capital for the smaller company. The shortage may sometimes be caused by the fact that the entrepreneur does not know how to gain access to funds. The information gap is enormous but, once the entrepreneur overcomes that gap, he or she still has the problem of convincing the supplier of capital to invest. If the supplier of capital is attracted elsewhere by a distortion created by Parliament, mere will be numerous problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I have some sympathy with proposals such as this. Indeed, before I became a Member of Parliament I once went to see a Treasury Minister to lobby him about the fact that the start-up scheme, as it then was, favoured larger rather than smaller companies. The enterprise
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0676">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>301</span>
investment scheme limits the amount of capital raised to £1 million. My proposal to a Treasury Minister, during one of those discrete lobbying sessions one could have in the old days, was that the Government should limit the business expansion scheme to a couple of hundred thousand pounds per company or, at most, half a million pounds per company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the limit is sensible and, having established the limit, we should consider whether the other restrictions are necessary. When I debated the matter with the EIS association, we concluded that there was some risk of leakage, but the problems with the regulations, especially the interests in land regulations, are such that it is not worth imposing additional restrictions. The £1 million restriction is good enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was brought home to me last year when a solicitor in my constituency showed me a well-worked-out business plan that he had constructed, which involved several individuals backing a small hotel leisure project helping the tourism industry. That project was on the margin of viability and had little chance of being backed without some form of tax relief for the investors. Only the enterprise investment scheme or the business enterprise scheme was likely to support it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The solicitor concluded that the investment was too risky. There was a risk of tax relief being withdrawn, which would have raised the cost of the investment as a result of breaching the interests in land rule. The first few years of the business were likely to result in losses and the resulting ratios between the net assets and the debt would have been sufficiently disadvantageous that there might have been some clawback of the tax relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can afford to allow the interests in land rule to be loosened because of the overall cap of £1 million. Any abuse is likely to be at the margin but, more importantly, we would still be able to encourage legitimate trading businesses in high risk areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Milburn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has not the hon. Member for Dover (Mr. Shaw) undermined the thrust of his earlier argument, with which I had some sympathy, on the distortions in the business expansion scheme in channelling investment into properties?

to provide investors with a range of opportunities. I would not want to construct a scheme that is available solely to people in the high-tech and manufacturing sphere. Such a scheme might not get off the ground because such investments often involve more than £1 million. The enterprise investment scheme may not succeed in helping very small companies because it is orientated towards backing larger companies which also have some form of finance from institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no difficulty with the fact that a hotel investment might receive money. Hotels are labour intensive and employ many people. They are good for employment and for developing an industry that is successful in this country. My major concern is that we should not encourage small-scale property developers, involving perhaps one or two people who make a lot of money from tax avoidance—perhaps almost tax evasion—and whom the Inland Revenue has difficulty in catching. However, I note that one of the seemingly safer risk investments of the 1980s was a secure contractor's investment whereby there was heavy gearing, but investors benefited from the arrangement that took many of the problems off the balance sheet. Such companies turned out to be very high risk and many went bankrupt. Investors who believed that they had invested in a safe scheme lost out. My concern is that the new scheme should encourage employment and entrepreneurs without leaking too much money into the wrong area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My answer to the last point, which is crucial, is that if the clauses are widened, as the Government propose, there is a risk that such widening will allow leakage. However, if the scope of the clauses is heavily narrowed, to the extent of restricting it solely to manufacturing and high-tech industries, there is a danger of not getting much investment at all; the lack of excitement and interest in that area might lead to people not issuing prospectuses and encouraging investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The slight widening will not cause much harm and the benefit of such widening is that, because there is an overall restriction of £1 million, there will be much greater interest in the enterprise investment scheme, many more active participants in terms of sponsoring companies and houses and, consequently, the scheme will get off the ground. One of the problems has been that although we have started the scheme, few prospectuses have been issued and not much success has been seen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I predicted last year in discussions with Ministers—I may have referred to it in Committee then—the scheme has been too restricted and too narrow. The business startup scheme and the business expansion scheme began in that way and we must loosen up slightly in order to get the enterprise investment scheme off the ground. The Government have struck the right balance and I hope that the Committee will allow the scheme to develop and get off the ground in a way that, I believe will lead to success and hopefully provide many jobs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, the Financial Secretary should explain how it is that the hon. Member for Dover had more influence over Government policy before he was a Member of Parliament than he has had since being elected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the remarks of both the hon. Member for Dover and the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) considerable support was expressed for the powerful case put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Darlington, who expressed our concerns about the implications of the relaxation of the schemes. My hon. Friend expressed a particular concern, which was reinforced by the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West, about the danger of investment being concentrated in relatively low-risk and property-backed schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to raise one aspect with the Financial Secretary. An investment may be low-risk for the investors, but high-risk for some of those affected by it. Is the Financial Secretary aware of the extent of the outrage felt in Scotland at the fourth sell off of homes by Scottish Homes, and the fears that that instills in 50,000 tenants? They are facing the horror of their homes being sold off over their heads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the predator bodies is an organisation called the Munro Trust, which has nothing to do with the Scottish mountains—in fact, it has only a nameplate address in Scotland. It has a director whose address is Park Farm, Tetbury, Gloucestershire and who is also a director of Johnson Fry, which made a name for itself running tax avoidance schemes under the old business expansion scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Financial Secretary understand the threat posed to Scottish tenants and their fear that the relaxations in the enterprise investment scheme could enable their homes to become the playthings of the tax avoidance industry, to be sold on after perhaps only five years with tenants having no say or control over the roof over their heads?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I imagine that the Financial Secretary will say that companies that depend on the receipt of rental income are excluded from the provisions, but we must probe more deeply than that. I seek an assurance not only that that is true, but that the possibility of a parent company being established—perhaps a property management company or some other sort of company—which, in practice, earns its income from the subsidiary company which collects the rents, will be excluded on the face of the Bill. We want a firm and binding assurance that would stand up in a court of law that the EIS, BES and VCT provision before the Committee could not, either directly or indirectly, provide any tax relief or subsidy to those with nefarious designs on people's homes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The party of the property-owning democracy seems to agree with the Labour party: we have argued in debates elsewhere that property tends to own—or at least to influence—democracy more in Great Britain than in other countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's insinuations are unworthy and cheap. I made it clear earlier that I believe that there are deficiencies in the amendment, and that I have called upon the Government to table an alternative amendment on Report to deal with the possible abuse of the interests in land rule.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. MacShane</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is clear and precise. It does not defer to a later date an issue that might be brought on to the Floor of the House and carried by a Government majority that would be ensured by the Whips. We have a chance now to send a clear signal to the property-owning and the property-investing fraternity that enough is enough. We should ensure that the investment capital that is encouraged under the scheme will be directed away from the property market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is all very well to suggest that the matter might be monitored by the Inland Revenue on a discretionary basis. However, massive staff cuts are about to be imposed on the Inland Revenue, so the chances are low that it will be possible to monitor the application of the scheme on a discretionary basis, as was suggested by Conservative Members. It would be better, clearer and more direct to agree to the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is there a huge demand or need for investment in property? The Library yesterday gave me figures that show that there is not a significant finance gap in the property market. Investment in the construction industry covering all the property market has risen from £41 billion in 1985 to an estimated £50 billion for this year. The cash is available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a problem in the investment in high, medium and low technology. When members of the Committee walk the high streets, they must realise that it is becoming more difficult to buy products that are made in Britain. Even—low-tech products—for example, fountain pens, which one can buy in W. H. Smith and Son—are increasingly made in other European countries. They are not made in third world, or Asian, economies, which have low labour costs, but in the heartland of high-wage, high-investment Europe. Low and medium technology industries do not have large start-up costs or much need for research and development. Investment should be directed towards those industries, and the amendment would do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Central Statistical Office has revealed the grave information that there is an increasing tendency for UK firms to invest overseas. A report from the CSO found that investment in UK firms grew by only 5 per cent. between 1992–93, to reach £9.2 billion compared with £17.4 billion in 1989.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, we can no longer rely, as we did in the late 1980s, on inward investment from Japan. Although, according to the CSO's statistics, inward investment grew by £388 million last year, that is only one fifth of the 1990 level. Most experts quoted Kate Barker, chief economist of the Confederation of British Industry or David Owen,
	<span class='label label-info column'>306</span>
UK economist at Kleinwort Benson, as expressing concern. Mr. Owen found that
	<br><blockquote><p>"domestic investment has been slow so far, particularly among large companies."</p></blockquote>
The thrust of the Bill's provisions in the direction of encouraging investment into the UK, either under EIS or venture capital trust proposals, is correct. However, we need to make it clear that such investments should not go into property as they are not needed there. The British disease means that, as part of our investment profile, we are a nation that hangs, falls and depends on flows and fluctuations in the property market. We are experts on that market, as is suggested by the Register of Members' Interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment proposes to ring fence property and would send a vital message throughout the country that, henceforth, investment in the UK should go into not only manufacturing and high-tech industries but a myriad of service companies connected with software and with offering assistance to manufacturing companies in how they arrange, promote and improve their affairs. We need to end the British obsession with making, handling, dealing with and sheltering money in the property sphere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith). I want to draw to the attention of the Financial Secretary and other members of the Committee—many of whom, due to pressures on their time, would not have been in the Chamber last night—the important debate on Scottish local government orders. The issue of Scottish Homes and the purchasing of housing in Scotland was discussed heatedly. The debate raised several serious matters that relate to an emerging scandal in Scotland. Members of the Committee may not know of the tremendous transition in the Scottish housing market, as Scottish Homes—a Government quango—is engaged in selling off property and releasing it to private sector landlords. It has also decided that the public sector landlord—the local authority—should not be included in any opportunities to control the tenancy of those houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those who so wished could use the provision that we are discussing this morning to exploit not only individual tenants but the public purse. I am sure that more private landlords than Johnson Fry are involved in the matter, although I cannot at present give examples. The issue of Johnson Fry's involvement has been brought to the attention of the Scottish people by my hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown). As a consequence of what has happened with the sale of Scottish Homes houses to private landlords and in view of our many worries about exploitation of the transition from a publicly rented to a privately rented sector in Scotland, we are concerned about the several opportunities in the clause to exploit that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As well as what has happened as a result of the decision to transfer tenancies, Scottish Homes—I reiterate that that is a Government quango—is straying into the political sphere. Sir James Mellon, its chairman and a retired diplomat—elected by no one—is now challenging Labour party policy. That has caused my hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton (Mr. Robertson) to raise the matter with the Prime Minister, the Cabinet Secretary and the Nolan committee.

	<span class='label label-info column'>307</span>
We should not think that the details that we are discussing this morning will have a minor impact. They strike at the heart of how we operate our public sector and manage the transition forced on it by the Government. That has called into question the motives of those who are trying to use the provisions to line their own pockets, while at the same time causing considerable difficulty to the public sector, to private tenants and to all of us who are concerned about probity in public and private life.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is my first contribution this week and I want to take the opportunity to congratulate you, Mr. Winterton, on your defence of Macclesfield town's aspirations on "Grandstand" on Saturday—I realise that that comment may influence you in calling me later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Darlington made the point about the principles involved and why the amendment, which was excellently moved, had to be tabled. There are two audiences to the enterprise scheme—the investors that have to be attracted and the influence on where that investment money will go. I believe that manufacturing is the key to the creation of jobs for the future. In 1989, manufacturing represented 32 per cent. of gross domestic product. That is now down to 20 per cent. We must send messages to investors that if we want an economy that promotes jobs, investment in manufacturing is the key.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be interesting to hear what the Financial Secretary says about the reasons for the change. The scheme was introduced 12 months ago, but according to the chronicles and the journals, it appears to be faltering. A way to attract investors is to open up the scheme to safer, more property-based investment. Perhaps we will discover the intentions and motivations of the Government. Do they want to bolster a scheme that people think is failing or do they want to attract investment to the manufacturing base?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In areas such as my constituency of Bradford, small companies tend to use rented properties or property on science parks. We need investment in a small manufacturing base. What we do not need is investors being tempted into wider property-based developments because that is not the objective. Labour Members believe that the amendment provides a focus and a target, which we think is important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to begin by making a general point. Listening to the debate and to similar debates on the Floor of the House on venture capital trusts, business expansion schemes and so on, and having listened in particular to the contribution made by the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West, I am sure that the Government have not made the case for change. Their argument seems to centre around two basic propositions. The first is that it did not matter so much in 1987–88 or 1992–93 with the business expansion scheme because the property market was less secure. At best, that proposition is arguable; at worst, it is unsupportable. I suspect that some Conservative Members share my concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>308</span>
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second argument advanced in support of the Government's drastic change is that we should not worry because there will be a £1 million limit. That seems to have convinced the hon. Member for Dover, who believes that the £1 million limit is okay—we can have one or two small hotel developments here or there and there are sufficient safeguards to ensure that the exploitation which took place in similar circumstances in the mid 1980s and early 1990s will not be repeated. The speculators and spivs will be satisfied with that. That was the argument advanced by the hon. Member for Dover, which, at best, was extremely weak. There is evidence that a whole host of people want to exploit. I am not simply saying this as a Labour Member scoring a political point; there is hard evidence of what happens when such facilities are enacted to allow exploiters to do their work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's proposition is not only to change things at the margins, which the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West suggested might be the way forward. It takes us back to the bad old days. It gives the exploiters if not a completely green light, then an amber light mixed with green. The dangers are clear. What is the Government's case? What assessments have they made of the effects of the change? Similar facilities that were available under previous schemes for property-based investment—or so-called investment—resulted in the Government being forced to make several drastic changes to those schemes, almost as panic measures to deal with the growing exploitation. So much so that, according to the figures I have for 1987–88, in 35 per cent. of companies 14 per cent. of the value was invested in manufacturing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures for 1992–93 show that in 13 per cent. of companies only 2 per cent. of the value was invested in manufacturing in a five-year period. The argument is unassailable and we are running the same risk now. The Government maintain that they can provide an assurance that because the property market is less secure, it will not be that attractive, except to those who want to build a few small hotels here and there, as the hon. Member for Dover (Mr. Shaw) said, and the £1 million limit will cap the possibility of that risk. I suspect that those arguments were made for similar property-based tax incentives in previous schemes, and we know what happened there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another important matter is that it is not simply the enterprise investment scheme that is being changed to allow property-based investment to attract tax relief; venture capital trusts are also affected. Reinvestment relief by property companies will be allowed under clause 40, so the Government are providing various opportunities without evidence that they are necessary. Where are the arguments, detailed analyses and assessment of the effects? I have not been present for every debate in the Committee or on the Floor of the House, but I have heard most of them. I have not heard the Government providing those important assessments on the detailed effect. We demand that for the record, which is available for all to see.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all want investment in manufacturing and to support and encourage that through the tax system. The argument is how that should be done and where it should be directed. The simple fact is that exploiters will be encouraged, but there will be less encouragement for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0680">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>309</span>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fundamental issue concerns the balance of probability and where the Government's change will lead us. The evidence of the 1980s and early 1990s revealed a serious problem, to which the Government reacted quickly, but that problem could be resurrected. The Government have not provided detailed analysis and there is paucity of argument on this important point. Their fundamental reason for the change is that the property market is less secure, but there is no need to worry because £1 million will make it all right. The balance of probability is that there will be more attraction for the exploiters than for the investors. If that is likely, we must do something about it now, because if we follow the suggestion, as the hon. Member for Dover mentioned, of waiting to see whether the people concerned are honest or dishonest, it will become clear that there are exploiters who will take advantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the balance of probability does not support the outcome that we all want—the stimulation of desperately needed investment in high-tech, high-risk companies—we have a responsibility to do something now. If we do not, there is a clear danger that investment will be attracted away from the areas which we all want to support and the Government will be forced to make more panic changes before long. Speculators and exploiters will not wait. Once they have seen an opportunity they will be in like a shot, although there may be a different Government in office by that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that Conservative Members will act on the concerns, which they have quite rightly expressed, by supporting the amendment. Now is not the time for messing about at the margins—the issue is a serious one. We have had the experience before and, if we are not satisfied by the balance of probability—on the basis of the paucity of evidence and assessment put forward by the Government in support of the changes—it is our responsibility to support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

As I have already said, my presidency of European Property Associates is entirely honorary. My position as consultant to Churchod and Company, chartered surveyors, derives from the fact that I was senior partner of that firm until my duties in the House prevented me

My directorship of the property companies listed in the Register of Members' Interests relates to the ownership of those companies by my wife's family trusts. None of the companies listed in the register has ever had an interest in a business expansion scheme or an enterprise investment scheme.

As hon. Members will know, I have served on the Committee of the Finance Bill in nearly every one of the 11 years that I have been in the House. Each time, I have been scrupulous to declare any personal interest that I might have in any matter being debated. I have never failed to do so. Indeed, when I was a partner of Churchod and Company, I even went as far as to declare the interests of some of the clients of the company in case I might be thought to be speaking on their behalf.

I hope that Labour Members will not press the amendment to a Division, but I have already explained why I shall be forced to vote against it if they do—the 50 per cent. rule would affect many genuine and desirable investments.

I believe that the debate was enlightened by the contributions from my hon. Friends. I believe also that the hon. Member for Rotherham was misguided in saying what he did.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Stevenson) criticised the Government for not having made a case. As no Minister has intervened in the debate, it was perhaps overly critical of the hon.

Given that a year has elapsed since the EIS was introduced, it might be helpful to examine what has been achieved so far. The Government have carefully monitored the early data about the initial schemes, which indicates that the early activity is hitting the right targets. Companies are using the scheme to raise an average of £80,000 each and over 50 per cent. of schemes involve a business angel—an investor who takes an active part in the management of the company. About 35 per cent. of the companies using the scheme started trading in 1994.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Examples of companies that have used the scheme are: a new publishing company in Harrogate which raised £135,000; a precision engineering firm in Staffordshire which raised £65,000; and new manufacturer of printed folded cartons in south Yorkshire which raised £160,000; a chilled food wholesaler in Surrey which raised £200,000; and a producer of electronic locker systems in Edinburgh which raised £78,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are typical examples of the companies that have used the scheme so far. They are the sort of companies that members of the Committee want to be helped by the scheme to raise equity finance. The changes we now propose are designed to encourage other companies like those to use the scheme; in other words, we want to remove restrictions in order to make the EIS more attractive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to reassure members of the Committee who are concerned that the EIS will open up opportunities for the tax shelter industry. The changes do not allow property companies which rent out private housing access to the scheme. But some unquoted trading companies—even those with significant holdings of land and buildings—are risky investments and consequently find it difficult to attract external investors and venture capital. That is why we propose to lift the interests in land rule, about which I shall speak shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I shall deal with the parallel trade rule, which was touched on by the hon. member for Darlington when he moved the amendment. That rule predates the EIS scheme and applied under its predecessors, the business start-up scheme and the business expansion scheme, introduced in 1983. The rule denies relief for investment in a company to an individual who is a member of a group of persons who control that company and another company or business carrying on a similar trade. It was introduced originally when relief was only available for start-ups, and it was directed against the possibility of transferring an established trade—for which relief was not designed—into a new start-up company. However, since 1983, relief has been available for expanding businesses and start-ups.
	<span class='label label-info column'>312</span>
The primary purpose of the rule has changed. Under the BES and the EIS the main purpose of the rule is to help to protect the annual limit—which is now £1 million— that a company can raise in a year and upon which relief is given. It is directed against the possibility of fragmenting what is, in effect, a single trade carrying it on in several separate but parallel companies, each of which has essentially the same group of shareholders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The parallel trades rule was not, however, specifically designed to inhibit that fragmentation, and was not very effective at achieving that purpose. It was difficult to apply because it was difficult to identify when the relevant group of companies or persons existed. The rule's existence could inhibit businesses from using the scheme—even when there was no suggestion of objectionable fragmentation—if they were worried that the rule might be applied in their case. We concluded that the rule could safely be abandoned, which could help to simplify the scheme without opening it up to abuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Darlington asked why we did not do that a year ago, when we introduced the EIS. We did not do so because, when we introduced the EIS legislation, it was designed to mirror the BES scheme wherever possible. Investors, companies and practitioners were familiar with the rules, which minimised transitional problems. This year, as part of our general drive towards simplicity and deregulation, we have scrutinised those rules and proposed the elimination of those that have afforded the Exchequer least protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was surprised to hear some of the Opposition Members' comments about the interests in land rule. We have debated the matter on several occasions. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling) discussed the interests in land rule earlier, when we debated clause 40. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I have some sympathy with the view that we should not strike at companies that are excluded simply because their main asset is the building in which they operate." 
	<i>[Official Report, Standing Committee D,</i> 9 February 1995; 
	<i>c.</i> 204.]</p></blockquote>
I agree. We are knocking out the interests in land rule. Given the background of the hon. Gentleman's perceptive and constructive comment, I am surprised to hear continuing resistance from Opposition Members to the rule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a previous debate, concern was expressed about the fact that the interests in land rule could prevent high-tech, high-added-value goods companies from using the EIS. Amendment No. 182 would abolish the rule only if a company were engaged in film production, distribution or research and development generally. I do not follow the logic of that proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked what was wrong with the amendment. Regular evaluations would be needed to see whether the 50 per cent. was triggered by the value of a property. Even if the value of a property did not change, but the value of the other assets did, it could be hit. Some small companies were precluded from taking part in the scheme because they owned their headquarters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other change is that property-backed investment is no longer regarded as a risk-free investment, as it was 10 or 15 years ago, when the BES was launched. I can give my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West the assurance for which he asked. As with venture capital trusts, the Treasury has the power, under EIS legislation, to amend the list of qualifying trades, subject to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0682">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>313</span>
Parliament. That is given in section 298(4) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened with interest and respect to my hon. Friend's comments about giving the Inland Revenue discretion to approve or not to approve companies. I see some disadvantages with the suggestion. The Inland Revenue would not want such a scheme, and several Opposition Members are wholly resistant to giving the Inland Revenue any more discretion than is necessary. Investors and practitioners would be worried by the lack of certainty. My hon. Friend's suggestion therefore did not commend itself to me. If activities are to be excluded, that should be done in Parliament. The Inland Revenue should not have to say yes or no to individual companies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West will have detected a lack of sympathy for his proposal. We have listened to him respectfully, but the amendment has several associated disadvantages that I have outlined and that we shall have to bear in mind if, with the best motives, my hon. Friend decided to pursue it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend pointed out that the regimes for VCTs and enterprise investment schemes are different. He touched on capital losses. It is true that the schemes have different risk profiles and, therefore, slightly different fiscal regimes are appropriate. A VCT—a pooled and quoted investment—is different from an EIS investment, which is more likely to be single company and, therefore, mean that the investor is locked in for longer. A slightly different, more generous fiscal rating that does not extend to the VCT may be appropriate for the EIS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. Members raised the question of Scottish Homes. I do not propose to throw my frail body between warring bodies north of the border. With relevance to our debate, the EIS is not open to a company that rents out property or to a company with a subsidiary that rents out property—and it never will be. A holding company can issue shares under the EIS but all subsidiaries have to be wholly engaged in qualifying activities. As I have made clear, holding property that is rented out is not a qualifying activity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend said that VCTs are a pooled activity and, therefore, have a different risk profile to and not the same degree of locking as the EIS. I would suggest that there is the same degree of locking. Although a VCT is a quoted investment and, therefore, regularly tradeable, most VCTs will not move materially in the market in their early years. Only when the possibility arises of an improvement in their activities—one hopes there will be such an improvement—does the exit become available to most investors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a valid point. Discussions with the stock exchange continue about the arrangements for quotation. I hope that there will be a market—albeit, perhaps, a restricted one—in VCT shares in their earlier years. Some potential investors such as the institutions do not get up-front relief. A market in those shares may be created by them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the right hon. Gentleman's remarks about the applicability of the scheme to property rental, he said that all subsidiaries of any company that would be eligible must not be engaged in rental property. What happens in a case where a company that is receiving the rental income is not a subsidiary but none the less provides services to, and does considerable business with, a subsidiary? For example, would a company that provides maintenance and other property management services to another company, not a subsidiary, which itself is collecting rent, be eligible under the scheme?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the few weeks that I have been at the Treasury I have learnt not to give on-the-hoof judgments involving tax. I should prefer to take seriously the hon. Gentleman's suggestion and obtain a specific judgment on his specific example. It is clear that some companies are precluded, such as those involved in renting out property. I think that that was one of the hon. Gentleman's main concerns.

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Liddell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister could find out whether the operation of the scheme is in order for a company such as Johnson Fry, which, in the past, has specialised in the EIS and has involvement with the Munro Trust.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Milburn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a fruitful and useful debate. I am grateful for the support of my hon. Friends and for the partial support that the hon. Members for Bournemouth, West and for Dover were able to give to some of my remarks. The Financial Secretary failed to deal with two substantive issues. He said that the parallel trades restriction is long standing and that it did not only apply in the first year of the enterprise investment scheme and to the business expansion scheme, but went back to the business start-up scheme in the early 1980s. It is odd that, some years on, the Government have decided to abolish an important tax avoidance measure. The Financial Secretary failed to say what pressure had been brought to bear on Ministers to introduce the provisions in clause 60. Nor did he say what the problems are with the existing provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much of the debate is centred on the interests in land rule and the doubts, concerns and suspicions of Labour Members, which I think were partially echoed by the hon. Members for Bournemouth, West and for Dover, about the way in which that investment incentive scheme could be moving backwards rather than forwards. I noted carefully what the Financial Secretary said. Although I welcome his guarantee that the EIS would never apply to rented schemes, he was not able to give a guarantee that investment will not be channelled into property-backed schemes and away from those manufacturing, high-tech research and development sectors that have exercised the minds and voices of members of the Committee during the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My concerns remain. The Financial Secretary referred to the support of Opposition members of the Committee for such a scheme, and to our worries about the investment gap facing many small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly in the manufacturing sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that, wherever they can, the Government should lend assistance to small and medium enterprises. They are a growing part of the economy. They promise much-needed employment in the future. If this country is to have the sort of future that we want, there is no doubt that high-tech manufacturing is where it is at. But we must be certain that tax reliefs of the sort contained in the EIS are the best use of public money, because tax reliefs are public money by another name. We must ensure that they are working effectively when compared with other potential alternative uses of that public money. In particular, before we approve the measures, we should be certain that Ministers have clear outcomes in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last year, I was struck by something that the former Chief Secretary said when he summed up the debate. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"there is a gap; it is worth trying to attract venture capital; it is certainly worth another try, and the scheme is in the nature of pump priming."</p></blockquote>
However, he also said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is also difficult to be specific about what will flow from it."— 
	<i>[Official Report,</i> Standing Committee A, 22 March 1994; c.776.]</p></blockquote>
There is the danger, that, like VCTs, taxpayers' money will be used to fund low-risk investment backed for property tax avoidance purposes. That concern united the Committee this morning, as has the contrary concern that our energies and resources should be targeted more effectively at other sectors of the economy, especially at manufacturing and research and development. None of us wants to return to the sort of fiasco that we witnessed
	<span class='label label-info column'>316</span>
under the old business expansion scheme. Given what the Minister has said this morning, I wonder whether all the lessons have been learnt. Once again, only a single year after its introduction, we are scrambling to make radical changes in the nature of the new enterprise investment scheme. Once again, the emphasis is on property-backed schemes, and that should worry the Committee. For those reasons, we shall press the amendment to a vote.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0684">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>317</span>
I am pleased to move the amendment, which stands in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Smith).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is universally accepted that we want to encourage investment in enterprise investment schemes and venture capital trusts by providing attractions to investors to roll over capital gains into such schemes. The problem is not so much to provide an attraction, but to remove a disadvantage that could otherwise exist for many investors. People may currently have investments that are unexciting, but secure, and we must tempt them from stocks and shares into more risky investments which are hopefully more rewarding for them and certainly more rewarding for the British economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must prevent people from being penalised if they crystallise an existing investment to reinvest in the enterprise investment scheme. They would be heavily penalised because the rate of capital gains tax is 40 per cent. That is much too high and is at the same rate as the highest marginal rate of income tax, which is a matter to which we may return later. It would be a major disincentive for anyone who currently holds an investment to switch out of that into this much more desirable activity if they were to have to pay capital gains tax. For that reason, we have given the relief that has so far been given for both EIS and venture capital trust schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government may have been misguided to set Budget day as the starting date, rather than 5 April 1994, because the relevant tax year goes back to 5 April 1994—indeed, we are still in that tax year as it runs until this coming April. Amendment No. 134, which stands in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield, should be made because it would be appropriate to take the starting date back to the beginning of the tax year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that some people will say that moving back the starting date will mean that those who have already made certain investment decisions might in some way be disadvantaged compared with those who have not yet made such decisions, but such considerations apply whenever tax changes are made. Some people will always be better or worse off than if they had waited and the Committee should not worry unduly. The amendment is in no way retrospective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That the starting date is set at the beginning of the tax year in question is desirable because otherwise there would be a danger that we would be unable to persuade investors to move into such a scheme until they faced their tax demands for next year. That would mean that tax considerations could delay funds entering such an investment. I therefore commend the amendment to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new relief to which my hon. Friend referred is the relief on the investment under the EIS, which applies to disposals on or after Budget day, which was the day on which the relief was announced. A similar relief is included in the package of venture capital trust reliefs, except that that relief is limited to chargeable gains on any disposal on or after 6 April 1995, which is
	<span class='label label-info column'>318</span>
the day on which the venture capital trust scheme comes into force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to extend the relief on reinvestment under the EIS to investors who realised chargeable gains between 5 April last year and Budget day. That would enable more funds to be available for investment in the scheme and therefore achieve a greater take-off. However, one must balance the arguments advanced by my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West against other arguments about retrospection and equity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Capital gains tax is an events-based tax; it cannot operate on any other basis. The key event is the disposal of an asset. A fundamental principle of our capital gains tax regime is that gains and losses are treated according to the rules in force at the date of disposal. Any change in those rules applies to disposals after the date from which the change is effective. That principle enables the taxpayer to be certain that a new relief will not be made available for disposals that have already taken place. More importantly, the taxpayer can be certain that, for example, an increase in tax or the abolition of a relief will not be applied to a gain or a loss that has already accrued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed new relief was not announced until Budget day, so investors who made gains before then could not have expected to make a single investment that both deferred the gain and attracted EIS relief. To make the new relief available for disposals before the first announcement of the proposal is, in effect, retrospective legislation. As the Committee knows, we are always careful about introducing retrospective measures. It may be suggested—I think that my hon. Friend did suggest—that retrospection is acceptable in those circumstances, because it is wholly to the benefit of taxpayers, but there is a contrary view. Let us suppose that I am a taxpayer who realised a gain between April and November last year and reinvested the proceeds in something other than an EIS issued before the Budget announcement. In those circumstances I might feel aggrieved at having been denied the opportunity to take advantage of the new relief because I had already invested the proceeds. That could be the effect of allowing relief to apply to disposals which occurred before the announcement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to disappoint my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West, but the amendment would be contrary to the operation of the capital gains tax regime. It would be retrospective legislation, falling unevenly on taxpayers and, despite my hon. Friend's powerful advocacy, I have to urge the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Milburn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased with the Financial Secretary's view, because the amendment goes a stage too far on tax reliefs. I have some general concerns about the schedule which I should like to deal with during the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The deferred relief introduced in the schedule brings the EIS relief broadly into line with that under venture capital trusts. Some concerns have been expressed on the Floor of the House and elsewhere about the way in which those reliefs are to operate. I suspect that most members of the Committee have not had an opportunity to read the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0685">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>319</span>
splendid publication, "Tax Shelter Report" and take advantage of its advice. It sums up the new proposals succinctly. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In effect an interest free loan of 40p from the Government on top of the 20p income tax relief</p></blockquote>
can be obtained for every £1 invested;
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East mentioned venture capital trusts when debating clause 64 on the Floor of the House, and said that investors were receiving a double benefit under the new proposal—receiving relief when making their investment and when realising it. When we consider the experience of the business expansion scheme, we see that there appears to be a danger of such investment incentives turning into a tax avoidance shelter. I hope that the Financial Secretary will be able to answer my questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, are there further planned incentives in the pipeline on the EIS? It has been operating for only one year and already a substantial new incentive is being introduced. Secondly, what are the costs of the proposed changes? There is always the danger with such incentives that the Government are writing a blank cheque—what calculation has the Exchequer made on the new reliefs?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I have two further questions about the proposed benefits from the reliefs. To what extent does the Financial Secretary expect traditional investment to be levered in via the EIS as a consequence of the introduction of the reliefs? How many additional jobs does he expect to be created in companies that will benefit? He has to be able to answer such questions if the Committee is to nod through the schedule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir George Young</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the hon. Gentleman's first point about the regime and the fiscal incentives, the 40 per cent. is tax deferred rather than tax foregone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to his specific questions, we have no further plans to change the regime, but no Minister can anticipate a future Budget. We have introduced some substantial extra incentives for the scheme and we need to find out how the market responds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about costs and jobs. We anticipate that the extra cost of the changes to the enterprise investment scheme will be £5 million in 1995–96 and £10 million in 1996–97 and 1997–98, over and above the existing reliefs for the enterprise investment scheme. I suppose that one could work backwards from that and generate a figure for jobs—I cannot do that on my feet, but will do so later.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->

Capital gains tax is unusual in that, in assessing liability it relies on assessing the gain, offset by any losses and aggregated to arrive at a conclusion in any one tax year. Losses can be carried forward to subsequent tax years, but the gain element must be settled within that tax year. In using Budget day as the relevant day, the provision discriminates in that tax year between those who made a gain in one part of the year and those who may have made
	<span class='label label-info column'>320</span>
a gain later in that year. There is discrimination rather than equity in my right hon. Friend's proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to deal with that argument. My right hon. Friend is not correct. Let us suppose that someone had sold equities and reinvested immethately in other equities. My amendment would allow him to sell those shares, move into an enterprise investment scheme and obtain relief only on the difference between the price of the two equities. The balance of the gain would be carried forward into the enterprise investment scheme. There would not be inequity if my right hon. Friend were to accept the amendment. However, I can see that he is not keen to accept it and, having heard his response, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The amendment is narrowly drawn. If hon. Members wish to go wider, I am happy that they should do so on the amendment, but if they do I shall not expect a stand part debate on schedule 15 to take place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to follow your strictures on that, Mr. Winterton, and will, with your indulgence, make one or two general comments on the venture capital trust scheme because schedule 15 is the first of two which, together with other clauses, introduce the mechanism that ensures that the venture capital trusts set up in clause 64 work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had a long and useful debate in the Committee of the whole House on clause 64 and the nature of VCTs, and we considered whether they would achieve the objectives set out by the Government. This is a probing amendment, but I would not want our probing and questioning to give the impression that we do not sympathise with the intended objective of VCTs, which is, to attract more capital into wealth-creating, job-creating enterprises and, in particular, into small and medium-size firms, which may have difficulty attracting capital by other means. In particular, we want capital to be attracted into high-risk ventures. Indeed, the purpose of tax relief is to provide additional inducement for an individual to put his or her capital at greater risk by putting it into a small or medium-sized company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we have several concerns. First, we are concerned about the Government's lack of an overall
	<span class='label label-info column'>322</span>
strategy, and about how such schemes fit into an overall policy to attract investment into higher risk ventures in small and medium firms. Secondly, we question the mechanism of tax relief and ask whether it can be effective in directing help where it is most needed. Thirdly, has the particular relief in question been so designed as to achieve the desired results?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are worried about the Government's lack of an overall approach. We have a general policy commitment from the Government; that they want to direct more capital and investment into smaller and medium firms, especially where those investments carry a higher risk. We understand that and go along with it, but the Government seem to have no general strategic policy framework within which schemes such as VCTs are supposed to fit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At one time, we hoped that the previous Financial Secretary would produce what would have been his memorial in the field, the Dorrell report, to examine why investments in Britain tend to be short term, and why we do not easily attract venture capital into small and medium-sized companies. Instead of a memorial, it seems that we have only a small epitaph buried by Lord Hanson because the intended report disappeared without trace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have never received an explanation of why an issue as important as investment in small companies and longer-term investment has never been the subject of a Government document, as we were promised it would be. Therefore, we are worried that the Government's proposals for such schemes as VCTs are not part of an overall strategy—they are not even well thought out—but are an effort by the Government to be seen to be doing something. That is inadequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule 15 is part of a complicated tax relief measure. We are entitled to ask some questions about the efficacy of tax relief schemes in general. Are they the best way of providing assistance especially to small businesses? That is a genuine question, which has, in the past, been asked by Conservative Members who have raised concerns about the whole issue of tax reliefs. Indeed, some of them, including the previous Chief Secretary, have said that, as a general rule, they do not like tax relief measures and are happier with simple tax schemes which do not distort the market. I have some sympathy with that opinion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary, in his previous incarnation, will have been party to numerous debates on whether mortgage tax relief would benefit the housing market or distort it, sometimes in an unhelpful way. I am not sure that he can tell us what will happen as a result of the tax reliefs. The nature of tax reliefs is that they are not controllable—the Government can implement them, but they cannot be precise about their impact.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carshalton and Wallington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman was referring to me, without realising it, when he referred to scepticism towards the policy of adding to tax reliefs, whether on the personal side or the corporate side. If the cap fits, I am prepared to wear it. However, as the hon. Gentleman wants to help small and medium-sized businesses, especially those involved in new technology, what would he do? Would he advocate grants? Or would he advocate improvements to the regulatory framework so that overhead costs of that kind become less of a burden?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>323</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for asking those questions because they are exactly what we should be debating. I am prepared to enter into a debate that considers the merits and benefits of making more grants available to small businesses. Labour Members have proposed the creation of regional investment banks which would be linked to proper local and regional economic strategies. That is because we are not opposed to the state having a role in those matters by intervening where appropriate. I would argue that tax reliefs are an intervention by the state in the workings of the market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want a more general and considered debate, perhaps even a major review of public policy, about how public money that is spent—we are talking about public money being spent, even though it is spent through tax relief—best achieves the objectives set out. I am not concluding that a grant regime would be better. What I am saying is that we have not had that debate to draw the conclusion that tax reliefs are the right way to proceed and will achieve the right objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Financial Secretary responded to the debate in the Committee of the whole House, he said that we would encounter costs of £290 million in two years' time as a result of the reliefs. At the time, there was concern about whether that cost included all the various tax reliefs available to investors in VCT schemes. I understood that the tax reliefs would not necessarily include the relief from capital gains tax. I should like the Financial Secretary to spell out the costings of the initial investment relief, the dividend tax relief, the capital gains tax relief and the deferred capital gains tax relief which are the four reliefs available on VCTs. Once we know their costs, we will at least have an idea of Government thinking on the overall cost of the scheme which we can then check against in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, will the Financial Secretary tell us where he dunks the money will go? When entering into such a scheme, which has significant costs attached, we are entitled to an assurance from the Government that they have some idea of what the results of the expenditure will be. Where will the money go? What sort of firms and industries will benefit? How many jobs will be created and in what areas? My hon. Friend the Member for Darlington raised the same points in the previous debate, but, as we are dealing with the same issues of tax relief and public expenditure, we are entitled to raise them again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also entitled to ask whether it is the Government's intention that the investment that will attract the tax relief should be additional investment or investment that would otherwise have gone elsewhere, in which case where is it to come from? Presumably the Government have done some initial surveys which lead them to believe that the expenditure is worth while. It would be helpful if they would share their conclusions with the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of our concerns arise from the history of tax relief schemes to encourage investment. I do not want to go back over the history of the BES because we have had that debate, but it colours our approach to the new schemes and makes us a little sceptical about whether the Government have got it right, which they failed to do with the BES. In case they have not got it right, what systems
	<span class='label label-info column'>324</span>
do they have to monitor the VCT schemes so that they can make changes quickly if the failings that we are concerned might be hidden in the detail materialise?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government took six or seven years to come up with anything like the right conclusions on the BES, which is why we proposed in the Committee of the whole House that there should be a further parliamentary review of the schemes in two years. That proposal was not carried, but the Financial Secretary ought to recognise that with such a complicated scheme—schedule 15 and schedule 16 are very complicated—the Government may not get it right first time and mistakes in the detail may lead to investment being made in a way that was not intended. How will the monitoring work and when will there be reports back so that we can give those issues further consideration?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that VCTs are different from the BES and the EIS since they involve investment not in a single company, but in a trust or holding company which will men invest that money in a range of smaller firms, but the principle of our concern is similar and we should like reassurances from the Financial Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That leads me on to the particulars of one or two other issues which still worry me. We have debated the interests-in-land rule, which is being lifted from the EIS and is not incorporated in the regulations for the VCT scheme. My hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East asked whether there are potential arrangements for a property management company not directly involved in renting properties to gain relief under the VCT scheme. When the Financial Secretary replies to that question, it would be helpful of he could also mention the situation for the EIS. If it is a worry for one scheme, it is a potential worry for others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are worried that the interests-in-land rule is not to be applied to VCT schemes. Relatively low-risk property development and ventures that would have attracted money anyway will benefit from VCT schemes, but the taxpayer will now help to subsidise them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The BES and EIS differ from VCT schemes in the way in which they are established. Investors invest in a trust or holding company, which invests in smaller companies. That means that smaller investors have greater opportunities to consider investing in VCT schemes. I doubt whether the restrictions and rules that are in schedule 15 will be terribly helpful to those investors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The relief available is substantial for people who are on high incomes and who have substantial amounts of investments already. My hon. Friend the Member for Darlington described the EIS schemes. New investments can gain 20 per cent. relief, as is mentioned in schedule 15. They can also gain 40 per cent. deferred capital gains tax relief at the same time. Those two reliefs total 60 per cent. Not many medium-sized investors—let alone small investors—have sufficient income or capital gains from previous investments to qualify for that level of relief. Some wealthy investors, however, may qualify. The potential reliefs are substantial, and include dividend relief and ordinary capital gains tax relief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Butterfill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will appreciate that the Government are trying to avoid a penalty on an investor in association with capital gains tax relief. If an investor switched from an investment into a VCT, he
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1994-1995V003P0I0688">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>325</span>
would suffer a penalty for moving his money if the relief were not available. We want to avoid that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was merely making the point that the relief was available and is, potentially, a large relief for the investor. My hon. Friend the Member for Darlington made the same point about the EIS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The relief will not be available to smaller investors, but it is possible that some smaller, or medium-sized, investors might be attracted by the VCT scheme. As part of their portfolio, they might consider having a slightly higher return for a slightly higher risk. A pensioner with, for example, £2,000 or £5,000 to invest, perhaps should not consider that scheme. However, many people have a lump sum available to them—through a retirement pension or a redundancy payment, or they might have inherited some capital on the death of their parents, which was wrapped up in a house. Previously, people may not have had the chance to invest medium-sized sums of perhaps £50,000 or £100,000. Those investors might decide that at least some of their lump sum should be put into a scheme that has higher returns, but runs a slightly higher risk. Presumably, the VCT scheme is designed to attract investors who have a few thousand pounds to invest from a larger portfolio. I am worried about those investors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As schedule 15 stands, people who invest in a VCT company have to own ordinary voting shares in the company. They could not own shares that do not have voting rights. The availability of preference shares, which might have a slightly lower risk and lower return from that investment, is also restricted. Schedule 15 includes specific requirements to restrict any schemes where it is considered that a loan is part of that investment instead of a direct investment in the shares of a VCT company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In such cases, some kinds of investment in VCT schemes exclude small investors who might want to attract some relief but not the risk that an investment in an ordinary share in such companies would carry. Those investors might be attracted by a different means of investing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Financial Secretary tell us why such restrictions have been included? Will they discourage small investors who might want to invest in a slightly more risky venture than they would normally consider?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to raise other points about the schedule's effects that relate to clause 64 and which might deter small investors from investing in VCT companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the Financial Secretary's attention to paragraph 3(5) of part I of the schedule which deals with the withdrawal of VCT status from a company. In such a case, the tax reliefs are withdrawn as well. In one sense, that is understandable. However, I repeat my point that many people with relatively small investments who might want to invest in the schemes will not have a direct, day-to-day, working knowlege of the company's management. The notion that ordinary shareholders know precisely what the company in which they hold shares is doing and
	<span class='label label-info column'>326</span>
that they control that company on a day-to-day basis is a figment of the imagination of those who believe that the workings of the capitalistic system are based on an idealistic model. We all recognise that, in practice, that does not happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some people who invest relatively small sums in a VCT company do not have detailed knowledge and may find that, through no fault of their own, someone running that company has been up to something that disqualifies it from VCT status. Small investors suddenly find that the reliefs to which they thought that they were entitled have disappeared.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How does the Financial Secretary propose to comfort people in that predicament? I am not talking about large investors but about people who may have invested £5,000 out of a £100,000 lump sum. Those people may be so concerned that they will not invest money in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is even worse. In clause 64, some of the rules on qualification for VCT schemes only come into effect three years after a VCT company has been established. We can understand that the company might need time to build up its portfolio investments in the various small companies in which it wants to invest. That means, therefore, that it might be three years before the qualification for VCT status is decided by the Revenue not to apply because the company has not met the requirements proposed in clause 64. Three years after someone has invested in the company, therefore, that person might find that it does not qualify as a VCT company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the provisions of clause 64, a further three years can pass before that relief is clawed back from the investor. That means that it can take six years, from making the investment to having it clawed back by the Revenue, before investors find out that they are not entitled to relief. That might concern a small investor who is interested in investing money in the scheme. How will the Financial Secretary encourage someone with a small amount of money to invest it in such a scheme when that kind of problem, over which one has no control, can occur?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not only that those small investors lose relief, a matter that is dealt with in schedule 16, which deals with capital gains tax. From what I understand of dividend relief and capital gains tax relief, one may lose relief from a specific point in time. However, with relief on the initial investment, one loses the total amount of relief—20 per cent.—backdated to when the investment was made. People can invest money in such a scheme and, six years later, through no fault of their own, find that relief has gone. That is precisely that kind of technicality that deters people from investing in the scheme at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
