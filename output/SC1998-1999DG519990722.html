	<p>10 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Mr. John Hutton)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Local Government Finance (England) Special Grant Report (No. 50) on Children's Services (Quality Protects) Special Grants for 1998–99 and 1999–2000.</p></blockquote>
The quality protects programme is a key part of the Government's strategy for delivering modern, high-quality special services for children. We are committed to putting right the failings of the past and ensuring that we promote a better outcome for the most vulnerable children in our society: children in the care of local authorities, children in need of protection from abuse and neglect, disabled children and other children in need because of economic and social deprivation or family breakdown. Our expectations for those children have been too low for too long and we are not prepared to tolerate that failure any longer. The future cost for the children and for society is too high. That is why we launched the quality protects programme in September last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The evidence of inconsistent quality and poor management in children's services has been too strong to ignore. We know, for example, from the children's safeguards review report and from the shocking testimony of those young people who suffered abuse in children's homes that the risks for children living away from home in the 1970s and 1980s were seriously underestimated. More recently, social services inspectorate reports and joint reviews have demonstrated that the quality of children's services is inconsistent, both within and between authorities. They have shown poor assessment, planning and case recording, unnecessary delays, inappropriate placements and haphazard decisions on who receives specific services. Those problems can no longer be ignored.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have recognised their responsibility to improve children's services, to provide the right legislative and structural framework, to set proper objectives and standards and to monitor and inspect services and outcomes. The quality protects programme covers all those issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main elements of the quality protects
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
programmes are as follows. New national Government objectives for children's services will, for the first time, set out clear outcomes for children and, in some instances, give precise targets that local authorities will be expected to achieve. Local councillors will have a new role in delivering this important programme. There will be a new special grant of £375 million over three years for children's services, starting this year. All local authorities will be required to submit an annual quality protects management action plan and a progress report to the Department of Health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are supporting the quality protects programme with a substantial investment of new, targeted resources. The new children's services special grant will provide £375 million over three years, to be spent on modernising children's services. The allocation of those resources will be £75 million this year, £120 million next year and £180 million in the third year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the grant—nearly £600,000 this year—has been set aside for the regional development workers and regional development assistants who have been recruited to help local authorities to deliver the programme of change required of them. All eight regional development workers, mostly from a background of social services but from other sectors too, are now in post and have already begun a major programme of development with local authorities in their areas. Most of the regional development assistants, of which there will be four full-time equivalents, are also in post.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The remaining money has been divided among the 150 social services departments in England. With the move to a new standard spending assessment formula this year, we decided to phase its introduction for the new special grant. Half of the allocations for authorities were calculated on the basis of the old standard spending assessment formula and half on the basis of the new. We made special arrangements for Rutland and the Isles of Scilly, where comments following the publication of indicative allocations highlighted their very small allocations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For this year, local authorities have been given six priority areas for expenditure of the grant: increasing the choice of adoption, foster care and residential care placements for looked after children; increasing the support provided for care leavers, including steps to prevent inappropriate discharge of young people aged 16 and 17; improving the management of children's social services, including more and better use of management information systems; improving assessment, care planning and record keeping; improving quality assurance systems; and listening to the views of children and young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Payment of the special grant for this year was dependent on local authorities submitting acceptable management action plans—MAPs. In future years, it will also be dependent on local authorities demonstrating, in annual progress reports, that acceptable improvement has been made in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0111">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
implementing those management action plans, the plans and progress reports will be the key documents in showing how local authorities intend to modernise their services and how well they are delivering in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All local authorities were required to submit their first management action plans to the Department of Health by 31 January this year. I am pleased to say that all the plans were evaluated by the Department's social services inspectorate as being of an acceptable standard. We published a national overview report setting out the key national messages from the evaluation of the MAPs on 29 June. Copies of the report are available to all members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities responded promptly to the requirements to submit a wide range of information in their MAPs and to engage properly with other local agencies. Local authorities have responded positively to the quality protects programme and are working closely with the Department, the social services inspectorate and the regional development teams to improve their children's services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the development needs that emerged from the management action plans were familiar from earlier inspections, joint reviews or special studies. However, the MAPs exercise was different in that the analysis of local need and the priorities for action were set by local authorities themselves. At the same time, clear links were made in some areas between the local quality protects plan, the priorities of other local partners, and national objectives. There were many examples of good practice and of creative projects, especially in areas such as care leavers and the education and health of looked after children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it is disappointing that local authorities too often lack the capacity to integrate those projects into a convincing strategic framework. The authorities that can do so are characterised by good senior leadership, a culture of openness and reflection, and positive experience of managing change. Unfortunately, those authorities are still in a minority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Management action plans were often best in their handling of placement choice issues, which is encouraging because that is central to the aims of quality protects. It is also the priority area on which local authorities plan to spend the largest part of this year's grant—nearly 39 per cent. of the £75 million. Management information has been identified almost everywhere as a major development need, and 13 per cent. of the grant is to be spent on it. Listening to children is also an area that needs more development, and 7 per cent. of the grant will be devoted to that priority. Promoting real participation by local authority members also requires development. In the light of our commitment to improve support for care leavers, I was pleased to see the plans for more expenditure on that group, which will take about 12 per cent. of the grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Throughout the year, we will help local authorities to implement their management action plans. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
national overview report provides the baseline for the national programme of work that we are currently developing at the centre. In the summer, we shall publish the national work programme, which will clearly set out what we will do nationally to support local authorities with the implementation of their quality protects plans. The national work programme will be supported by regional development plans, which will be taken forward by the regional development workers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning briefly to the future, in October, we will issue a circular to local authorities, setting out the requirements for their MAPs and progress reports for next year. The plan is to build on the work done this year and to ensure that local authorities make the progress that they are committed to bringing about. In the autumn, we will issue allocations for the grant for next year, subject to parliamentary approval.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The quality protects programme is a major programme of change and reform. It is a vital opportunity to make a real difference to the lives of vulnerable children that needs to be seized by all those responsible—by central; and local government working in partnership, by the national health service, by education, and by the voluntary and independent sectors. We need to ensure that we listen to what young people themselves have to say about their experiences of the services that they have received, and how we can improve those services. The Government are determined to ensure that quality protects will make a real difference to the lives of the most vulnerable children in our society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Day 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cheadle)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman), would want me to apologise to the Committee for her absence. Knowing her as I do, I am sure that she has a good reason for not being here. If she had been here, she would have confirmed, to the Committee's great relief, that we do not intend to divide or detain it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.10 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Randall 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Uxbridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, have a limited amount to say on the subject. As my hon. Friend the Member for Cheadle (Mr. Day) said, in principle, We do not oppose the provision in any way. I would however like to highlight a couple of areas. For example, although the Minister referred to increasing the public's awareness of adoption and fostering, greater emphasis should be placed on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On more parochial matters, the Minister will know that serious child care problems arose in respect of the London borough of Hilhngdon. I am delighted to see that the hon. Member for Hayes and Harrington (Mr. McDonnell), who may wish to say a few words, is participating in this prestigious Committee. The Minister wrote to the hon. Gentleman, my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson) and me on the matter, which is of great concern to us
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0112">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
all. It would be mean-spirited of me not to welcome efforts such as the money that has been allocated to Hillingdon, where special circumstances apply. The Minister seems to recognise that Hillingdon has a serious problem, so perhaps he will undertake to consider the matter more closely, with the backing of hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report on child care services in Hillingdon made the important point that we need to put party political issues to one side and act together. The fact that the Committee will not divide on what is an important and fundamental issue indicates our willingness and desire to bring about improvements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.13 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John McDonnell 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hayes and Harlington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise not only to make a simple parochial point about Hillingdon, but to extrapolate from local problems the lessons that we need to learn nationally. The process that we are debating will deal with the problems, which is why I welcome the report and the specific allocation of resources. Had that been done several years ago, Hillingdon would not be experiencing its current difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One problem is that the same management who failed to tackle the needs of children in our area have also prepared the management action plans. In agreeing to the grant, we should not give up the flexibility that additional resources and interventions could provide in the coming two years. During that time, we hope that the local authority will deal with the problems identified by two social services inspectorate reports on the failure of the London borough of Hillingdon. The Minister has intervened on the matter and clearly takes it seriously. I hope that we can maintain flexibility, because the failures of management that have been identified in Hillingdon will require further intervention in the coming two years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.14 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Burstow 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sutton and Cheam)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, do not want to detain the Committee long, nor do I intend to divide the Committee. I shall however raise one or two issues and seek some clarification from the Minister. I should begin by apologising for not being in Committee to hear the Minister's opening remarks. I hope that he will accept my apologies for asking questions about anything that I might have missed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister rightly set out some of the difficulties and inefficiencies in the arrangements for child protection that pertained before the introduction of the quality protects initiative. I very much welcome the introduction of the initiative and the new rigor that it will require local authorities to adopt. I know that local authorities welcome it, as well as the additional resources that accompany it. It is right for the
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
Government to emphasise and to get local authorities to engage with the fact that being a corporate parent is not solely the responsibility of social services departments; it is the responsibility of elected members throughout each local authority. In that sense, these are multi-disciplinary issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the fact that eight regional development workers are now in post, but I should be interested to hear a little more about that from the Minister, especially about how the people in those posts are working with local authorities and what progress has been made through their work. Some of us will have to study in detail the report that we have received today, although I appreciate that work on the management action plans is on-gong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certain concerns have been brought to my attention by various directors of social services, particularly the director of social services in the London borough of Sutton, and by the Association of Directors of Social Services. All those people welcome these initiatives, but they are concerned about the adequacy of supply of qualified staff to enable the agenda to be implemented properly and in a timely fashion. That problem is acute in greater London, but the concern goes wider too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Minister satisfied that there are sufficient qualified staff in child social work to enable local authorities to put in place good-quality professional staff who will be able to deliver the agenda? In addition, is he satisfied that the pipeline of training for newly qualified social workers is adequate to ensure that local authorities have a good choice of candidates when they make appointments? That is of particular concern in London where, to some extent, local authorities are poaching staff from one another in order to fill key vacancies in their departments, so as to deliver the agenda and to ensure that they are up to scratch in providing children's services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second concern that has been expressed to me relates to the timing of the release of money. This Committee is meeting in the run-up to our recess, six months into the financial year—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Three months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burstow</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I defer to the Minister—we are three months into the financial year. Nevertheless, concerns have been raised about whether the timing enables local authorities to benefit from the funds for a full year and to make proper use of them. Concern has also been expressed about whether the Department will take account of the timing of the release of the moneys in assessing local authorities; delivery of their plans in the current financial year. Whether it is six months—I agree that it probably is not—or three months, as the Minister said, I hope that he will say something about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point relates to care leavers—referred to in "Mapping Quality in Children's Services: An Evaluation of Local Responses to the Quality Protects
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0113">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
Programme"—and is based on a note that I have, but which I am not sure that I entirely understand. No doubt, the Minister will educate me if I am wrong. It appears that local authorities will receive income support for those who are in care for three months. The question that has been put to me—sometimes it is advisable not to ask questions if one does not have the answer, but I am taking that risk—is how those resources will be transferred to local authorities. Will they be part of quality protects grants or will they be a separate stream of income? I accept that I may have the wrong end of the stick.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the Government's initiative to put money into this project. If staffing is in place to deliver it, local authorities will embrace it wholeheartedly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.20 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: All hon. Members who have spoken have welcomed the quality protects grants. I am grateful for their support for this major programme which gives us an opportunity to get things right. The reaction of local authorities has been positive and we are looking forward to working closely with them to ensure that the programme becomes the success that we want it to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall) and my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harrington were worried about developments in their local social services department in Hillingdon. I share their concerns. The chief inspector of social services recently met, or is about to meet, the leaders of all political groups in the London borough of Hillingdon, together with a senior management team, to discuss those concerns. It would not be helpful to say more than that today, other than to stress that we are taking a close interest in the affair and we will not hesitate to take the necessary action to ensure that children in both constituencies are protected.

The hon. Member for Uxbridge wanted us to place a higher priority on improving adoption opportunities and placement choice. If he looks at the circular that accompanies the quality protects programme, he will see that adoption and improving placement choice is the fist of six priorities. The national overview report, which is available today, shows that a little more than £13 million of the £75 million for this year's quality protects special grant is being spent by local authorities on that service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to understand that the £75 million is allocated to local authorities and that it is their decision to use the additional resources to improve placement choice, including adoption. That speaks volumes. Placement choice is a part of children's services that has not been properly developed in recent years. We are determined to bring adoption back into the mainstream of children's services, because it will often be the best option for a child who has been looked after in the care system. We are placing the right emphasis on promoting placement choice and
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
adoption, but I do not dispute that there is more work to be done.

The hon. Member for Uxbridge and my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington will be pleased to know that we are taking a close interest in what is happening in Hillingdon. I am sure that they will welcome the £380,000 that is being spent this year in the borough under the quality protects programme. My hon. Friend asked whether more resources will be provided this year as part of the quality protects grants. There will be no new resources this year, but there will be significant additional allocations in years two and three as the amounts that are released increase. This year, the amount was £75 million; next year, it is £120 million; and in the third year, it will be £180 million. Crude arithmetic allows us to work out the likely significant additional increases for children's services.

The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow) asked several questions. He was especially concerned about staff shortages. The Government are also worried about trends in the recruitment of social work and social care staff, and we are taking action to deal with some of those matters. The hon. Gentleman, who takes a close interest in these matters, will be aware that the Government are committed to introducing legislation at the earliest opportunity to establish new arrangements and structures for the training of professional social care staff and others in the social care work force. We intend to establish a general social care council, and we are currently working closely with the new training organisation for personal social services—TOPSS—to develop a new national training strategy for England. Similar strategies are in place for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have significantly increased the resources for the training support programme—more than £120 million over the next three years. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that that money is a grant to local authorities to support and improve the training of social care staff who work in a local authority or in the independent and voluntary sectors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are promoting new education and training opportunities for social care staff who work with children, which is the subject of the report that is before us. If the hon. Gentleman refreshes his memory of the White Paper "Modernising Social Services", he will recall that we proposed various initiatives to improve the training opportunities for social care workers who work with children. They included improving level 3 national vocational qualifications for residential child care staff and improving the post-qualifying support for professional staff with a new post-qualifying award in children's services, which is being piloted and has run in eight centres since January.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is much activity and many initiatives are under way, underpinning all of them is the need to ensure a proper supply of qualified social care staff
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0114">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
and improvements in the arrangements relating to the training of professionally qualified social workers. Later this year, we hope to make further announcements about our longer-term intentions towards the professional education of social care workers. The hon. Gentleman will have to be patient in waiting for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman expressed concern about the timing of the release of the moneys. To pay such a grant quarterly in arrears is the normal way in which local authority grants are distributed and we shall not depart from that practice. We have received no complaints from local authorities about the payment arrangements relating to quality protects. We are trying to facilitate the payment of the grant to ensure that there are no problems. I assure the hon. Gentleman that, although the first payment will not take place until some time later this month or early next month, there is no question of any of the money being lost—it is for this year, and all of it will be spent this year.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for not being in Committee at 10 o'clock. I had not received my card notifying me of the Committee's sitting, and I thought that it would start at 10.30 am. I believed that I would be in time to hear the debate, but I must apologise for being late.

My hon. Friend the Member for Cheadle has brought me up to date and told me what he said. We agreed beforehand that we should not vote against the report, because we want to encourage the Government
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
in their efforts to reform children's services. That initiative stems from the committee that produced the Utting report, which was set up when the Conservative party was in government. I am sure that all Committee members share a genuine desire to transform children's services along the lines that are outlined in the quality protects document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are pleased that the first priority in the report involves enabling children who are looked after to be adopted or fostered, or to enter into other arrangements that will take them out of an institutional setting and into a caring and protective environment. My hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier) has repeatedly called for that in Adjournment debates on adoption. We welcome the fact that that aim is the Government's top priority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are somewhat concerned that the sixth of the priorities involves listening to children, but I am sure that the fact that it is the last of the listed priorities does not mean that listening to the users of the service is a lesser priority. I am sure that all Committee members want listening to children and understanding of their perspective on the services that are provided to be a high priority in the transformation of children's services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said at the outset and as my hon. Friend the Member for Cheadle made clear, we have no intention of obstructing the passage of the report by voting against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
