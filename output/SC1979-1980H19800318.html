	<ol>

	<li>Subsection (1) above shall apply to any conversion related to the theft of a chattel as it applies to the theft of a chattel; and, except as provided below, every conversion following the theft of a chattel before the person from whom it is stolen recovers possession of it shall be regarded for the purposes of this section as related to the theft.

May I first apologise to you, Mr. Dean, to members of the Committee and to all concerned for being responsible for the delay that has occurred? I shall do my best to make up for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause, as mentioned on Second Reading, implements a recommendation of the Law Reform Committee that, where property is stolen, the owner's rights against a thief should not be barred by the lapse of time. I also pointed out on Second Reading—though it was hardly necessary—the complexity of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the interval between Second Reading and Committee, the draftsman has had another shot at simplifying the provisions of the clause—the effect is the same. I hope that the Committee will feel that the draftsman has been successful. Speaking
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
for myself, if the amendment is made the same effect will be produced, but in rather more simple, direct and understandable terms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>'This subsection only applies if the trustee acted honestly and reasonably in making the distribution."'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment provides that a trustee-beneficiary who receives part of a trust fund as his share on a distribution of the trust property will be able to rely on the proposed new defence to claims by later-comer beneficiaries only if he acted honestly and reasonably in making the distribution. That corresponds with the Law Reform Committee's recommendation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here is another instance of the value of consultation. This useful suggestion was put forward by the Chancery Bar and the Government are happy to adopt it and commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In the amendment the Government are adopting a suggestion made by the noble Lord Mishcon speaking on behalf of the Law Society in the other place. The Government think that it is a sensible
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1192">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On Second Reading I indicated that the Government had been persuaded by certain arguments put forward by a number of people, and particularly by the Law Society, that subsection 2(
	<i>b</i>) of the proposed new section 26 was otiose and undesirable and that therefore the Government would be taking steps to remove that additional qualification. The amendments give effect to that proposal and I commend them to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Archer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having had an opportunity to recover my breath I sympathise with the Solicitor-General's difficulty in getting here this morning, because I encountered the same problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Solicitor-General may recollect, from an intervention that I made on Second Reading during the speech of the honourable Member for Newark (Mr. Alexander), that I had some sympathy with the arguments adduced in another place by the noble Lord Mishcon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the amendments. The whole course of the Bill is a happy example of law reform conceived under one Administration and brought to maturity under another, with the fullest possible consultation with all the interests concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
I seize the opportunity to raise one question that was discussed in another place. It arises from the case of Batty and the Metropolitan Property Realisation Limited. The question whether a particular fact is a fact relevant to the plaintiff's right of action may turn on the question whether his right of action is in contract or tort. The limitation period begins to run when the cause of action is complete. Where the cause of action is in contract it is complete when the contract is broken, whether or not the victim suffers any damage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of most torts and certainly in a case of negligence, it is complete only when damage results from a breach of duty. Therefore, where there is a breach of duty of care resulting from a contract, the plaintiff may rely upon two courses of action. In consequence there may be two quite different limitation periods. If any fact relating to the damage is concealed from the plaintiff, it may be relevant to the cause of action in tort and prolong yet further that limitation period. It may not be relevant to any cause of action in contract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That matter was raised in another place by Lord Mishcon. I think that he raised it on Second Reading only to call attention to it, but it is a problem which, as he said, has exercised the Law Society and the consultative committee of the accountancy bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the other place the Lord Chancellor, referring to the Law Society, said that it may conceivably be concerned with its own interests, since if anyone is contemplating bringing an action against a solicitor arising out of negligence, the solicitor would prefer the limitation period to run from the date of the contract, thus eliminating uncertainty. I would not seek to speculate whether or not that was the motivation of the Law Society. I do not think that arguments ad 
	<i>hominem</i> necessarily advance the matter. It hardly affects the validity of the argument. The Lord Chancellor said that he would prefer to allow case law to run a little longer before considering intervening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought that this is the very sort of question on which the legislature ought to make up its mind on the merits and not leave it to the judges. I appreciate that the problem arose after Lord Justice Orr's committee had reported. Therefore, it had no opportunity to consider the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1193">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
If the Solicitor-General tells us that the Government are prepared to direct their minds to the question and to consult those concerned, I shall not seek to obtain anything further today. Let me reassure him at once that I have no intention of dividing the Committee. It would be highly inconsistent if I did, but I should be grateful for anything that he can tell us about the Government's intentions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Solicitor-General</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the right honourable and learned Gentleman. The amendment discusses one small part of the problem of how we should deal with latent damage—when a person should be able to bring his action in a case where damage does not become immediately apparent, but only emerges later. It is a part of that problem. I freely concede that what we are dealing with only one small part of it in the amendment. I know that the right honourable and learned Gentleman feels that it is a useful part, albeit small.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the present Government, and the Government of the right honourable and learned Gentleman, had to consider that question, there were only two aspects of it. First, those that had been dealt with and secondly, that the difficulties do not arise only from the period of limitation. Some difficulties arise from deciding when the cause of action arose. The period of limitation does not begin until the cause of action has arisen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is now a third complication arising from the case to which the right honourable and learned Gentleman referred. In a particular case a person may have either a right of action in contract or in tort and the cause of action may arise at a different date, depending on whether he is proceeding on his right of action in contract or in tort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government accept that at the stage to which the matter has progressed there is a problem that cannot simply be left, though whether an answer can be found to it is another matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government accept that there is a case for further review, in view of the additional developments centering particularly on the 
	<i>Batty</i> case. Therefore, the Lord Chancellor is considering with the Secretary of State for the Environment, who has a major interest in the matter, whether it would be appropriate to mount such a review in the near future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the alternatives would be to refer this specific problem to the Law Reform Committee. I do not think that the right honourable and learned Gentleman would expect me to commit the Government to a particular course, but I am happy to tell him that the questions of what further reference there should be and how the problem could be tackled, are of immediate concern to the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I echo what the right honourable and learned Member for Warley, West (Mr. Archer) said about the Bill, being an example of how all parties can combine in getting useful legislation through sensibly and quickly. On behalf of my honourable Friends, Mr. Dean, I thank you for the courtesy and expedition with which you have assisted us to dispatch our business this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition would like to echo what the Solicitor-General said about the courtesy and expedition with which you, Mr. Dean, have controlled our proceedings. I add my thanks to the Solicitor-General for letting me know in advance his thinking on the amendments. That is always helpful. We have perhaps dealt with what may be exceptional cases, but I think that we shall have made a number of people a little happier when their cases come up.

My colleagues are anxious that I should point out to the Solicitor-General that he should not anticipate that we shall be necessarily quite so uncritical of the Government on every future occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
