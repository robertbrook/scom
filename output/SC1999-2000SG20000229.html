	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first item of business is a statement on tackling poverty in Scotland. There is no time limit for statements and subsequent questions. However, statements eat into the time allowed for the major debate and I shall therefore act to ensure that the Committee has time for that debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Alistair Darling)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With permission, Mr. Maxton, I shall make a short statement on the Government's progress in tackling poverty in Scotland—progress that depends upon our working closely with the Scottish Executive. Our objective is to tackle poverty and social exclusion by dealing with their symptoms and rooting out their causes. Tackling poverty and providing opportunity for all are essential planks in our policy. The Government and the Scottish Executive are working hand in hand to halve child poverty within 10 years and to eradicate it within a generation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report "Opportunity for All", published in September 1999, sets out the Government's strategy to tackle poverty and social exclusion. That report was complemented by the report launched last November by the First Minister of the Scottish Executive entitled "Social Justice". Those reports set out strategies and targets for tackling poverty and social exclusion. We are taking children out of poverty and we are moving people out of poverty and into work. There are now 700,000 more people in work. In Scotland, 2.3 million more people are in jobs—the highest level since 1966. Youth unemployment is down by nearly three quarters, thanks to the new deal and other measures. We are also reforming pension provisions for the future as well as tackling the poverty of the poorest pensioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Income, however, is only part of the picture. As well as tackling poverty of the pocket, we are determined to fight poverty of opportunity and poverty of expectation. Social exclusion is caused by more than poverty. It occurs when other factors—unemployment, poor housing and poor health—combine with poverty to trap individuals in a spiral of disadvantage. It needs joined-up government to grasp those problems effectively. The Scottish Executive has responsibility for many of the issues that are vital to tackling those problems at the root, and the Government are working in partnership with the Executive in order to make real progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are committed to halving child poverty within 10 years and eliminating it within 20 years. From April 2000, the rate of child benefit for a first child will be £15; for the second child and subsequent children it will be £10. That change will benefit 1 million Scottish children. We have introduced the working families tax credit, which ensures a minimum weekly income of £200 for 140,000 Scottish families. As a result of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
various measures that we have taken, about 60,000 children in Scotland will be lifted out of poverty. Families will, on average, gain by about £740 a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, we are dealing not only with incomes, but with opportunity—which will be the result of better skills and qualifications. The Government's work to combat child poverty and social exclusion is being complemented by the work of the Scottish Executive. From next year, total spending on school education will, in real terms, be at an all-time high. For example, the early intervention programme, which will be backed by an investment of £56 million between 1997 and 2002, will help children in the earliest years of primary school who have problems with literacy and numeracy. That will benefit at least 5,000 additional children by 2002. More than 50,000 four-year-olds currently benefit froma nursery place, and all three-year-olds will have part-time nursery places by 2002. It is the sum of those measures, not any one of them, that will ensure that Scottish children, wherever they live, get a good start in life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tackling the poverty of children is often about tackling the poverty of their parents. More than 20 per cent. of working age households in Scotland are without work. Although unemployment is declining, many families are still without work. Between 1979 and 1996–97, the proportion of the population in workless households doubled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have introduced changes to make work pay. More than 100,000 employees in Scotland are entitled to higher pay as a direct result of the national minimum wage. On average, that raised the incomes of those who benefit from it by 30 per cent. The 10p starting rate of income tax and the working families tax credit will improve the incomes of the poorest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are helping those who can work to get work with the new ONE service and the new deals. More than 20,000 young people in Scotland moved into work with the help of the new deal. There is a ONE pilot in the Clyde coast and Renfrew district, and an employment zone prototype in Glasgow. We are seeing the results. Employment in Scotland has increased by 38,000 since 1997. We need to do more, of course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Complementing the improvements, the Scottish Executive are tackling poor housing and homelessness. The Minister for Communities has announced a package of £12 million in grants to local authorities to combat homelessness and rough sleeping. Last week, 400 new homes were opened in Castlemilk as part of a £23 million project to provide new homes for rent and for low-cost ownership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are making reforms for pensioners, too. We are restructuring pensions so that the low paid, carers and disabled workers will do better—18 million people will gain across the country. We are helping people to provide for a retirement to look forward to. We are also tackling pensioner poverty now. We are setting a minimum baseline for the incomes of the poorest with the minimum income guarantee, which will help more than 150,000 Scottish pensioners. Winter fuel payments of £100 to each pensioner household—paid, for the first time, last year before Christmas—benefit 900,000 pensioners in Scotland. The payments will now be made every year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The oldest and poorest pensioners will each gain more than £500 a year from the improvements that we have made—winter fuel payments, changes to VAT on fuel, the minimum income guarantee and the

	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
introduction of free television licences, which benefits 250,000 Scottish households.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must help those who were left out during the past 20 years, and address the inequalities and the deep divisions that we inherited. We cannot hope to make a difference for people if we consider their problems as separate issues. Some of the problems are about worklessness, but they are also about poor health, poor housing and poor education. Social exclusion is the sum of those difficulties. The fight is against poverty of opportunity and poverty of expectation, as well as against the poverty of income. We shall fight those evils. We are determined to deliver change and a better future for society fit for generations to come. I commend the statement to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Secretary of State for the advanced copy of the statement. My office could probably have predicted most of what was in it, because it was largely a round up of what had already been announced. I welcome the fact that a UK Minister has come to the Grand Committee—an important part of the Committee's role is to ensure that UK Ministers understand the way in which their policies affect Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask the Secretary of State about the means testing of benefits especially the minimum incomes guarantee for pensioners and its take-up rate. Estimates suggest that 500,000 UK pensioners—from a quarter to a third of pensioners—are not taking up the benefit. Does the Secretary of State have the figures for Scotland?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Secretary of State not agree that uprating the pension would guarantee that pensioners not taking up the benefit would receive the money, because they would receive it directly in their pension? Does he recognise that older pensioners have had less chance to prepare for the modern world of retirement and for the length of their life, and have used up most of their savings? He would tackle the core of pensioner poverty if he targeted on older pensioners the increase in pensions. Does he accept that the national insurance fund surplus is growing—it will double from the 16 per cent. that it requires to 35 per cent? It he was willing to spend it, £8 billion could be freed up from that additional surplus to put an extra £15 a week on pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Secretary of State accept that, in the long run, the Government will have to consider a replacement to the working families tax credit? It will become embedded and employers' culture will begin to recognise that a person might receive the going rate for a job without the employer having to make up the full rate of pay. Does he recognise that poverty of opportunity would have been better tackled if the Government had acknowledged the electorate's wishes and not stuck to Conservative spending pains for their first two years in office?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me deal first with the fact that this is a Scottish Grand Committee. All hon. Members present represent Scottish constituencies and we have a deep interest in what happens to our constituents. The work that the Government are doing in Westminster complements the actions of the Scottish Executive. I have something in common with the hon. Gentleman: both of our parties are involved in the Administration
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
in Scotland. People who consider the Scottish Executive's action to combat poverty and promote opportunity will see that it has an excellent record. I hope that what it is doing will one day find its way on to the front pages of the newspapers, because there is a good story to tell and our constituents should be aware of it. Combating poverty of income and opportunity is central to the aims of the Administrations in Westminster and in Holyrood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about pensions and the minimum income guarantee. We have inherited this problem: although pensioner income has increased dramatically in comparison with that of the rest of the population and better-off pensioners are doing substantially better, about 2 million pensioners throughout the country have lost out. We are directing most of our help towards those pensioners. The minimum income guarantee is therefore geared toward precisely the pensioners mentioned by the hon. Gentleman—the oldest and poorest ones, who tend to have no savings. As I said, the Government are spending £5 billion more on pensioners during this Parliament; the oldest and poorest pensioners will be £500 better off than they would have been without a change of Government in 1997.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked whether it would be better to increase pensions across the board—I think that that was what he suggested. That is an option, but the poorest pensioners would lose out because every penny given to them would be taken away under the benefit rules. I remind the hon. Gentleman in the nicest possible way that if he looks at the Liberal Democrats' manifesto—as I dare say he did in the idle moments that one has during a general election campaign—he will see that Liberal Democrats' commitment was to increase the state pension in line with prices. 
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) intervenes from a sedentary position to say "plus". Yes, the Liberal Democrats also wanted a specific measure to target help to the oldest and poorest pensioners. The Government are doing that; the difference between us and the Liberal Democrats is that we are spending about double what they proposed before the election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned some other problems connected with older pensioners and pensioners who need time to build up the pensions. Because of the changes that we are making to the state earnings-related pension scheme—which, incidentally, the Liberal Democrats have pledged to abolish—someone on £6,000 a year currently receives some £14 a week under SERPS, but under the new state second pension, for which legislation is now passing through the House, a person on £6,000 will get £54 week. That is real help for the poorest people in the country as well as carers and disabled people. Some 18 million people will benefit from the changes that we are making to the state second pension. We are making long-term pensions changes, helping those who cannot save and assisting moderate earners by increasing the money that they receive to put into their occupational pensions. Crucially, we are helping the oldest and poorest pensioners—the very people who lost out under the Tory Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Coatbridge and Chryston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my right hon. Friend for a refreshing statement of what the Government have done and are doing in respect of those important matters. He mentioned carers and disabled people; will he enlarge on the Government's thinking in that respect? Even before he made those comments, I wanted to point out that the Government's huge achievement in setting up the Disability Rights Commission applies equally in Scotland. Can we ensure that the Scottish people—especially disabled people—are made aware of our commitment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall take your words to heart, Mr. Maxton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat that, for the first time ever, carers and disabled people will have access to the state second pension. That is a real improvement in the standard of living of people who have given up a lot to care for others. My right hon. Friend is right to mention the Government's setting up of the disability rights commission. We have also implemented all parts of the legislation for which he campaigned for many years, to give disabled people rights. I agree that rights for disabled people should be a reality throughout the United Kingdom. I know that the Scottish Executive are as committed to that as we are. The take-up campaign will start fairly shortly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Ewing 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Moray)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In welcoming the statement, I draw the Secretary of State's attention to the Sutherland report. Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that only one of its many worthwhile recommendations has been implemented—the establishment of a care commission? When will the Government provide a comprehensive strategy in response to the recommendations? What is the right hon. Gentleman's advice to the 14 national organisations and 100 elderly people who will meet Members of the Scottish Parliament early tomorrow morning in Edinburgh?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are the implications of the Secretary of State's statement today for the decisions that are to be debated in the Scottish Parliament tomorrow, in connection with the local government settlement? Many good ideas about care and looking after vulnerable people are dependent on that, because it is local authorities that are asked to provide services. Has the right hon. Gentleman any advice for the Scottish Executive—in particular the Liberal Democrats? They may be in the Administration in Scotland and in Opposition down here, but the rumblings are that the Liberal Democrats are unhappy about the local government settlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, what is the Secretary of State's reponse to the Webber report, which shows that Scots top the league table of Britain's poorest?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Subject to what Mr. Maxton says, I do not think that the hon. Lady can get to her feet during my reply to her question. I am delighted to see two members of the Scottish National party here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that the hon. Lady might refer to a paper on pensions produced by some of her Edinburgh colleagues, which would have given me the opportunity to point out that it was based on statistics from 1993 and that they would be well advised to do some decent research into pensions rather than rely on woefully out-of-date figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the commission on care, one of the Government's first acts after they were elected was to set up a royal commission. There are real problems in ensuring that long-term care is affordable. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health announced in the House of Commons just before Christmas that the Government are considering the implications of the report as part of the spending review that is being carried out with a view to making announcements in the summer. The Government are aware that many elderly people face difficulty in funding long-term care. We want the long-term care funding package to be sustainable in the future. A past problem has been that packages and suggestions have not lasted or been sustainable. We are determined to put long-term care on a proper footing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady also asked about the local Government settlement, which is, of course, a matter for the Scottish Parliament. It is for that body to decide how to allocate money between local authorities. She made a good point in that the local authorities need to work closely with central Government—both the Department of Social Security and the Scottish Executive in Edinburgh—to ensure that elderly people have access to all the services that they need, whether in a nursing home or through day care or other help. The Government are determined to do something about the matter and, unlike her party, we will have the funds to do it, because we will not be spending large sums of money on breaking up the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my right hon. Friend take this opportunity to confirm that the whole point of the working families tax credit is to make families better off than they were under family credit? I am sure my right hon. Friend recognises how widely that has been welcomed, but can he tell the Committee what is the least amount by which a family will be better off, after housing benefit has been included in the equation? Furthermore, will he publicise that figure? Many people are under the impression that they will not be much better off, so they are not even bothering to apply for the benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point. Many poeple do not realise that if they take up full-time work, they will receive at least £200 a week and will not start to pay tax until they earn £235 a week. In addition, the working families tax credit gives substantial help towards child care, the cost of which can be a significant barrier to people who want to work. My hon. Friend will know that the Government embarked on a widespread national advertising campaign last autumn. Our research shows that awareness of the working families tax credit is growing rapidly. However, we need to ensure that people who are thinking about going out to work, especially women and lone parents,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0253">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State consider the situation of retired people who are just above the capital or income limits for the minimum income guarantee? Will he also confirm that there is a big underspend in his Department this year? My hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir R. Smith) mentioned that there continues to be a rather large surplus in the national insurance fund, and the Treasury is rumoured to have some £7 billion at its disposal. What opportunities are the Government giving to those pensioners who are just above income support limits and who will receive a 75p increase in their pensions in April?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In addition to the increase in the basic state pension, pensioners will receive a £100 winter fuel payment, which was not available to them before the Government were elected. That is £100 for every pensioner household, and every household that includes someone over the age of 60 from next year. In addition, from November this year, every pensioner household with someone over the age of 75 will receive a free television licence worth £101. In addition, the minimum income guarantee is available to the poorest. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the capital and income limits. I have said, on numerous occasions, that the Government are keeping that issue under review. I remind the hon. Gentleman that the Liberal Democrats' policy at the previous election was to increase pensions in line with prices, not earnings. We are doing far more than the Liberal Democrats ever promised. Of course, the difference is that we can deliver our promises, whereas they had not a hope in—whatever the parliamentary language for the place is—of delivering it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend will probably know that, as pensioners, almost 20 per cent. of the electorate are eligible for the minimum income guarantee. In my constituency, 11,916 pensioners are eligible. Unlike the national media, the local media is very willing to take up such campaigns and to broadcast matters that benefit the local community. My local papers. 
	<i>The Falkirk Herald, The Grangemouth Advertiser</i> and 
	<i>The Bo'ness Journal</i> and the local radio, Central FM, deserve commendation, and I hope that my right hon. Friend will join me in that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Pensioners now telephone me to ask where they can obtain income support application forms and they are worried about going to the Department of Social Security office. My right hon. Friend might be aware that his Department is running a pilot scheme in conjunction with Falkirk council in Bo'ness, where a one-stop shop has been set up. People can go to the one-stop shop to obtain application forms for any benefits, either from the local council or the DSS. Will my right hon. Friend guarantee that he will increase resources in that area, so that people can go to community centres and other places where they feel more at home to pick up application forms for income support, which will entitle them to the minimum income guarantee and other benefits, including housing benefit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right that 150,000 pensioners in Scotland will benefit from the minimum income guarantee, which is a significant number of people. We want to ensure that everyone who is entitled to any benefit, including the minimum income guarantee, receives that benefit. I think that, fairly soon, I will have some news that will encourage my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend made another good point, which relates to people who might be in the Room. Local papers are a very good way to get these messages across. They are exceptionally well read and have been known to carry articles by hon. Members that pur across the good things that the Government are doing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Maclennan 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do the Government recognise that increased fuel prices have a burdensome effect on the car-dependent poor excluded people in rural areas of Scotland, especially the highlands? Approximately two thirds of families with incomes of £200 a week or less, and 93 per cent. of families with incomes between £200 and £300 a week, have cars. The price of petrol—85 per cent. of which is Government-imposed tax—in the highlands is disproportionate to the price paid in any other part of Britain except Cornwall. Will the Secretary of State contemplate establishing an interdepartmental task force with his colleagues in the Scottish Executive to find ways, not merely to alleviate poverty and exclusion, but to end the isolation of people who live in those areas. The Government in Scotland are aware of that problem, but have done nothing to relieve it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has a point. Everyone who regularly visits the highlands and islands knows that petrol prices are high. As my right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced in the pre-Budget report, we are ending the fuel duty escalator. In addition, we have increased the money that is available for rural bus services, and my hon. Friend the Minister of State for Scotland is about to meet oil companies to discuss the differential in oil prices. It is not altogether clear why petrol prices are so much higher in one part of Scotland, and sometimes at petrol stations that are not too far apart.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Pollok)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome this morning's announcements, but are there any plans to consider the level of the minimum income guarantee, which appears to be low? Will my right hon. Friend tackle the plight of pensioners who live on small occupational pensions and who are aggrieved that, having been prudent throughout their lives, they are receiving nothing? Although they are not earning a great deal from their pensions, they are just above the level at which they would qualify for benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On television licences, the free licence for 75-year-olds is not such a benefit in some areas as it is in others. Recent statistics show that only 51 per cent. of my constituents are expected to live until they are 75. In Eastwood, it is 66 per cent. and in the poshest parts of England it is more than 75 per cent. The measure benefits those who are better off and who are likely to live longer. Although I cannot claim to have the support of the Auchtermuchty

<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the minimum income guarantee, the rates increase in April. As for television licences, a large number of pensioners in my hon. Friend's constituency and others will benefit. His point about life expectancy returns us to the heart of the Government's policy and my statement about poverty. It is because we want everyone to have a better life that we need to tackle the root causes that contribute to a shortened life expectancy in some parts of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the key factors that influences life expectancy is poverty. That is why the Government have pledged to eradicate child poverty within a generation. We want to ensure work for more of our fellow citizens to allow them a better standard of living. We want to improve health care and the quality of housing—and take all the other measures that might improve life expectancy. It is worth reflecting on the fact that, in 1945, the average life expectancy after retirement was one year. Now, many people live for 20 or 30 years after retirement. We need to improve people's life expectancy, and tackling poverty and its causes is fundamental to achieving that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Tayside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State clarify one point? The hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir R. Smith) asked about the expected uptake of the minimum income guarantee, in Scotland, but, unless I am mistaken, I did not hear a specific response to that query. If the right hon. Gentleman is not persuaded of the virtue of an across-the-board increase in the state pension, will he tell the Committee whether the minimum income guarantee will reach the targets that the Government have set? How shall we know whether that has happened?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Darling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Despite the fact that the hon. Gentleman did not raise many good points, he is at least entitled to a reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about an earnings-related increase. It is worth bearing in mind that pensions have been increased in line with earnings for only three of the previous 100 years. Increasing the state pension universally helps all pensioners to the extent that everyone gets the same increase; however, the poorest pensioners lose every extra penny that they receive. We have introduced the minimum income guarantee because it will greatly increase the amount of money that the poorest pensioners will receive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government estimate that between 300,000 and 700,000 people in the country are entitled to the minimum income guarantee but, for a variety of reasons, they do not all receive it. However, it is difficult to say precisely how many people do not take up the income guarantee because they do not know about it. As I have said on the Floor of the House, I am determined to ensure that all pensioners receive a far better service from my Department than they got previously, and that they have the money to which they are entitled. The £5 billion extra that we are spending on pensioners this year will mean that the oldest and poorest pensioners will be £500 a year better off than
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
they would have been had the Tories remained in power. We are determined to do more, because we believe that pensioners should be treated properly. It is a disgrace that pensioner poverty should exist at the beginning of the 21st century; tackling that poverty is at the heart of everything we are trying to do for older people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I begin by welcoming all right hon. and hon. Members to this sitting of the Scottish Grand Committee. It is interesting to see that the Liberal Democrafts are sitting in the position of the official Opposition; that accolade is not often accorded to the Liberal Democrats by the Scottish press—except, perhaps, by 
	<i>The Bo'ness Journal,</i> which is noted for its accuracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Grand Committee provides Members of Parliament who represent Scottish seats with the opportunity to discuss many of the important matters that are still reserved to the United Kingdom Parliament. That role is as valid today as it was before devolution. Some issues, which are hugely important for Scotland, are still decided in Westminster by the United Kingdom Government. None of those is more important than employment policy, including the new deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Enforced unemployment is not only a cause of despair and to the detriment of our economic recovery; it is also the root of many social evils. The performance of the new deal is there for everyone to see. We publish statistics on it every month. Last Wednesday, for example, we announced that no fewer than 44,800 young unemployed people in Scotland have joined the programme since April 1998. Of those young people, 21,370 have found jobs through the new deal. I find it astonishing that anyone can think that that subject is not worthy of being discussed and debated by elected representatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also announced recently that more than 10,000 employers in Scotland have signed on for the new deal. On behalf of the Government and the Labour party, I congratulate them on their role in working with us as partners in overcoming unemployment. Employment policy, like policy on other matters vital to the well-being of Scotland, remains reserved to this Parliament. However, we do not discuss issues such as those debated today in an attempt to challenge the Scottish Parliament. I want to make that absolutely plain, as my

	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security has. We discuss those issues in partnership, as the Government and the Scottish Executive are committed to working together and co-operating to deliver a better life to Scotland. That is what we always intended devolution to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware that some people have attacked the decision even to discuss such matters in this forum. I do not know for whom such people think that they speak, but let me tell them that they do not speak for the people of Scotland. It comes as no surprise that such attacks have been levied at the Committee and at our discussions. Some hon. Members have never supported devolution and prefer confrontation between the Parliaments to co-operation as a means of improving life in Scotland. Frankly, they would rather turn Holyrood into a battering ram against the United Kingdom than into a vehicle of partnership with this Parliament to deliver a better life in Scotland. I ask those hon. Members one simple question: if they regard unemployment in Scotland as not worth discussing and think that the British Parliament is not the vehicle to do it, why are they here? What are they doing in Westminster and why are they willing to pick up the seats, salaries, privileges and pensions if, at the end of the day, they are not willing to participate in making life better for the people of Scotland? They owe an explanation to the Scottish people of whether that attitude is hypocrisy or double standards. They should tell them whether it is a great difficulty to distinguish between a principled position and a pension cheque. Those of us who are working along with the Scottish Executive on the new deal and on other matters demand that explanation on behalf of the people of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government made five pledges in their manifesto at the election. One of them was to get no fewer than 250,000 young people in the United Kingdom—25,000 of them in Scotland—off the dole queues, off benefit and into work by using money from a windfall levy on the privatised utilities. I am pleased to say that we are nearly three quarters of the way to reaching that pledge. By the end of last December, 185,250 people throughout the United Kingdom had moved from benefit and into jobs, thanks to the new deal. Of those people, 221,370 were in Scotland. Three years in, we are three quarters of the way towards redeeming yet another of our pledges to the Scottish people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Scotland, the new deal is delivering a major part of an economic revival. As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said, it is also part of our attack on poverty and of the implementation of social justice. It is part of a raft of measures, some of which have been mentioned, such as the minimum wage, the new 10p starting rate of tax for the lower paid, the working families tax credit, the major increases in child benefit and the guaranteed income for the lowest-paid pensioners. All the measures are improving the lives of millions of ordinary people in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom. People ask what the Labour Government are doing; that is the Labour Government in action, delivering a better life for people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can tell the Committee a story of staggering success in our attack on youth unemployment. We have managed to reduce it in less than three years by 55 per cent. by conservative estimates, or by 69 per cent. by other estimates. That is a Labour Government in
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>

Does he agree that the tourism and hospitality industry in Scotland has made an excellent contribution? If it continues so positively, there is no reason in the world why the target set by my hon. Friend the Member for Central Fife (Mr. McLeish) of 3 per cent. growth cannot be achieved, because we have so much to offer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Reid</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly agree with my right hon. Friend. I am glad that he mentions our hon. Friend the Member for Central Fife, who is a Minister in the Scottish Executive. The Scottish people did not want an examination of the minutiae of the continual raking over of the processes from devolution—they wanted it to deliver something through all politicians, in both Parliaments, working together for the benefit of Scotland. The area mentioned by my right hon. Friend is one of those in which we can deliver.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We expect a growing problem to be not the diminution of unemployment but a skills shortage if we continue to be so successful in putting people into work, which we do in partnership. The new deal is symbolic of the Government's partnership approach. It requires partnership between Departments, between UK resources and policy planning and Scottish Executive planning and implementation, and between 23 local partnerships in Scotland. Such partnership in action is delivering for the people of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Secretary of State aware of the answer, supplied by the director of the Office for National Statistics, that the Economic Secretary to the Treasury gave to my right hon. Friend the Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley)? It showed that, in Scotland, 43 per cent. of people going from the unemployment pool into employment went back into the unemployment pool within 12 months. Scotland had the second-worse record in the United Kingdom. What are the Secretary of State's comments on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Reid</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new deal was meant to address that problem, and that is why we are having such a sustained attack on unemployment. Of the 21,370 young people who had found jobs in Scotland, 15,180 are in sustained employment. Three quarters of those on the new deal are not only in jobs, but are in jobs for a long period unsubsidised. If the hon. Gentleman is saying to me that we still have much to do, he is right. The Government are not complacent or arrogant. If, however, he is saying that we may dismiss out of hand the 69 per cent. reduction in youth unemployment under the Labour Government, that would be illustrative of the prejudices that he has brought to the question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that we should not be discussing the matter, and that it is of no relevance to the people of Scotland. Could he not have brought himself to say, "Well done so far, but there is more to do"? His comments would have carried a little more weight had he said that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

acquit me of prejudice in the matter if I raise with him the difficulties experienced by those who have to travel to find work in rural areas. A constituent told me last week that she could not afford to drive from Wick in Caithness to Thurso in Caithness to get her minimum wage in the very tourist industry that was spoken of by the right hon. Member for Coatbridge and Chryston (Mr. Tom Clarke). The cost of driving ruled it out. The Government are doing well with the new deal, but they will have to face the problems of rural areas where driving and travel are crucial to employment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Reid</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accuse the right hon. Gentleman of prejudice. His point is widely recognised and the problem is accepted. It is important to get transport policy right. New deal partnerships have been set the task of working with local authorities to meet unemployed people's mobility needs, particularly in rural areas, by extended bus networks, cheaper fares or other means. I do not pretend that the Government have solved every problem. How could we have done in three years? We have, however, made a significant start. As a measure of that, I remind the Committee of the point at which we started.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

When we took over the horrific legacy of the Tory Government, almost a third of Scotland's unemployed had been out of work for more than a year. One in five families in Scotland had no work at all and there were more than a million fewer jobs in the United Kingdom than there had been in 1990. That did not daunt us and all the figures show that we have made a major advancve in tackling a root cause of poverty in Scotland—youth unemployment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Donohoe</div> <!-- member -->

They are full of rhetoric, some of which we have heard this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Reid</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not only the Tories who are responsible. When we were fighting for the minimum wage we had to deal not only with the Tory Opposition but the Tory Trojan horse in the Scottish National party, which would not turn up even to vote on the matter. On the new deal we encountered opposition from the Tories. Their colleagues in the Scottish National party were not prepared to support it. They mocked it and today could not bring themselves—the people who claim to represent Scottish interests—to admit that, whoever is responsible, it is good that nearly 70 per cent. of young people in Scotland who were previously on the dole are now in jobs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We promised, despite the daunting circumstances in which we started, to give 25,000 young unemployed
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
Scots opportunities for education and training. We achieved that; so far 21,370 have benefited from that pledge. We promised action on long-term unemployment. We have achieved that. In May 1997, 49,500 people in Scotland had been unemployed for more than a year. In January 2000, 26,500 were in that position. That was a decrease of almost 50 per cent. in less than three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We promised hope in place of despair and opportunity in place of the dole. Although we have only started, we have replaced despair with hope for tens of thousands of Scottish men and women. We could not have done that in isolation. Of course, we had to create a stable economic framework—the sort of economic framework that would be devastated and undermined by the constitutional demands of the Scottish National party to break up Britain and divorce Scotland from the rest of the United Kingdom. We have managed to bring down inflation to a record low, the economy is growing and, in Scotland, the growth of output over the past year has exceeded the average in the United Kingdom. Despite the strong pound, Scottish manufacturing exports have grown; public finances are under firm control; investment in the two priorities of education and health is at an all-time high.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a Labour Government in action, and I can give two figures to illustrate that success: more than 2.3 million people in Scotland are now in employment—the highest level of employment for 33 years—and, according to the claimant count, unemployment in Scotland is at 5.1 per cent., which is the lowest for 24 years. The new deal has played a significant part in that, providing practical help and about £350 million in Scotland until March 2002. However, we are not content; we are learning and building. We have extended the new deal to help other groups: lone parents, the disabled, people over 50 and the partners of the unemployed. We are doing that through partnership, not least through 23 local partnerships. We have also been fortunate to attract on to the Scottish advisory task force a range of committed individuals drawn from various interested sectors under the able chairmanship of Sir Ian Robinson, to whom I should like to extend my thanks on behalf of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Innovation and flexibility are two key features of the new deal, along with the new intensive gateway approach. The drive for improvement continues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

My right hon. Friend rightly emphasised the need to focus on retraining youngsters for the labour market, but we should not overlook the problems faced by the over-50s. This might not be the moment or place to raise this issue, but I hope that, in the near future, my right hon. Friend will agree to a debate on the needs of such constituents, who are badly handicapped in the labour market at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Reid</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. My hon. Friend need not wait because the new deal has already been introduced for lone parents, disabled people and the over-50s, precisely for the reasons that he outlined. If he catches your eye, Mr. Maxton, he will have an opportunity to raise some of those issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new deal 50-plus offers an innovative and flexible range of measures to attract those unemployed people who are aged 50 and over and their partners back into employment. The programme supports the code of practice on age diversity in employment, which was launched in June to improve the position and treatment of older people in the labour market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the Government have a story to tell and I support much of what the Secretary of State has said. However, he said that the programme was developing, and one of those developments causes me some concern. I am surprised that the Secretary of State is happy to defend the Government's policy of sanctions. The Secretary of State is aware that 18 to 24-year-olds who fail for a third time within 12 months will be subject to a 26-week benefit reduction. That is a surprise coming from the lips of the Secretary of State, with his track record in politics, because even the Tories were frightened to introduce that policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Reid</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not only obliged but happy to defend the Government. The sanction that the hon. Gentleman mentioned is a third attempt. The vast majority of people in Scotland believe, as I do, that young people have the right to have an opportunity to work, and that that right is balanced by responsibilities. A civilised society is one in which those who genuinely cannot find work are supported, but which, at the same time, advocates their responsibility to work, if work can be found for them, for the benefit of the rest of society. I know that that is not a liberal view, which only stresses individual rights, but it is the basis of a thing called socialism, to which many of us still adhere, which balances rights and responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Someone said last night, on the 100th anniversary of the Labour party, that what separates us above all else from other parties is our recognition that individuals do not live isolated lives. That is, as one philosopher said, where previous philosophers got it wrong. As individuals, we live in a society in which we have mutual rights and responsibilities. That is the basis of our socialism. The person who said that was my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister. That is the difference between us and the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, the success of the new deal is no accident. Figures published earlier this month show that unemployment in Scotland fell by 15,000 compared with the equivalent period a year earlier. Claimant count figures for the new deal show that the number of 18 to 24-year-olds who were unemployed for more than six months fell once again and are down by 3,500 on last year's figure. The new deal has changed the lives and futures of thousands of people in Scotland. Tragically, it was opposed by the Tories and mocked and ignored by the SNP, who even today regard this vital weapon to attack unemployment as not worth discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State and I meet beneficiaries of the new deal almost weekly. We know from individual experiences how well the new deal is working. The statistics offer a broader picture. They show how the
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
Government are delivering in Scotland and how the new deal is helping us to achieve our wider objective of eliminating social exclusion and ending poverty. But the statistics cannot reflect the smiles and the pride that we see on the faces of our young people who are no longer unemployed. The statistics cannot show the independence and the dignity that the new deal extends to lone parents. Charts on the wall cannot show us the hope that it has given to so many who, under the Tory Government, faced nothing but despair. For those reasons, I commend the new deal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Secretary of State for Social Security for his opening speech. Having a UK Minister for such a debate will help the Committee and, in the long run, UK Ministers. The right hon. Gentleman said that he represents a Scottish constituency, but Standing Order No. 93(3) does not prevent a Minister from another part of the UK from attending a Scottish Grand Committee. It would be good to have a mixture of Secretaries of State and Ministers from other Departments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Reid</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly intend to consider that. The Committee considers important business, and we want to work in partnership with the Scottish Parliament. I shall consider carefully how we can bring other Ministers, even non-Scottish Ministers, to the Committee to answer questions and take part in the debate. The hon. Gentleman makes a constructive suggestion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome that. If a devolution is to work, we do not want a dependency culture to develop in which UK Ministers rely on someone else to keep an eye on matters in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most people will embrace the philosophy behind the new deal. It is right to encourage a culture that provides people with a desire and reward for wanting and being able to work. We should not create a system that allows people to think that they will never have a chance to work and which makes them permanently dependent on benefits. Both sides of the Committee would agree on that. The Secretary of State was right to recognise that the statistics reflect the achievements not only of individuals who operate the new deal, but of those who take part in it. We should congratulate people on taking their lives forward and building a future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it is too early fully to judge the new deal because we are in a period of economic growth. The real test will be a downturn in the economy. No matter how committed Chancellors are or how stable the management of the economy is, unless there is a strange transition into the new millennium, the economy will go down as well as up. If people are careful, the downward swing may not be too wild, but it will still happen. The economy is also affected by circumstances beyond our shores. It may not be a case of boom and bust, but it could be one of gentle decline and growth. A decline in the economy will challenge the new deal. That is apparent in areas of Scotland where there is high unemployment or a lack of jobs for beneficiaries of the new deal to take on. The new deal will have to be expanded to work hand in hand with people who are able to create jobs and the right climate for jobs,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0258">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
especially where people cannot get work in their communities. We need to tackle that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Long-term funding of the new deal must be considered. As the Secretary of State said, it was funded on a windfall tax, which is a one-off tax. It does not demonstrate a long-term commitment. The Government should tell us where future funding will come from and how the new deal will grow when the windfall tax has been spent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman care to reflect on media reports that, to pay for the student finance deal, the Government in Scotland plan to remove resources from Scottish Enterprise for measures that are duplicated by the new deal? In our sitting before the election, the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire asked the former Secretary of State about the future funding of the new deal. Would the hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important, especially for people who claim to be nationalists, to recognise that an elected Scottish Parliament exists to hold the Scottish Executive to account. It is not the role of Westminster MPs and Ministers to tell it how to conduct its affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On long-term funding, the Government got away with the windfall tax. It was flagged up in their manifesto, which gave out a clear warning. However, they must accept that uncertainty in a market places an extra premium on every job that is created. Jobs are created by investing money, and people are only willing to put money into job creation if they can measure the risks involved. A Government who have unstable tax commitments produce uncertainty and put an extra cost on every job that is created.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has unfortunately touched on a serious and long-term problem for my constituents that was created by the Chancellor. The Labour party has not appreciated that the windfall tax is dangerous. After the Chancellor introduced the windfall tax, he floated the idea of taking more money out of the North sea oil industry, destabilising it, putting a risk premium on investments in it and threatening jobs in my constituency and the future economic well-being of the north-east.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new deal is about getting people into work, and the best way to enable people to get into work is to ensure that jobs are availble to them. For a whole year, the Chancellor said that he did not know what tax
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
regime would apply in the North sea. That uncertainty was hanging over a major part of the United Kingdom economy that contributes about 20 per cent. to manufacturing investment, and it put a risk premium on future investment.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our serious point is that the Government should have considered carefully what they were doing, how fragile that industry can be and its operation in an international investment market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Government have learned that lesson. It took a year for them to do so and they have set up a task force, on the back of which many other developments have come. Lessons have been learned, but there was uncertainty for a year in the North sea and there is uncertainty behind the funding of the new deal. So far it has been funded by a one-off tax, but we do not know where the funding will come from in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new sanctions will be introduced on 6 March. I do not think that the Secretary of State realises that anxieties have been expressed not only by one or two Members of Parliament. The Social Security Advisory Committee was also concerned, and paragraph 7 of its report on the Government's proposals, under the heading "Committee's response", states:
	<br><blockquote><p>The Committee's report suggested that some of the people who are already incurring sanctions for failing to meet their New Deal Option responsibilities are doing so inadvertently, or for reasons that in large measure lie beyond their control. The Committee suggested that young people will have incurred sanctions because of poor conduct resulting from the lack of life skills and the knowledge of what is acceptable behaviour; because of minimal family support; or because of their negative experience of previous education or work opportunities and a lack of appropriateness or choice in the New Deal Option placements available to them.</p></blockquote>
The report goes on to make recommendations. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>The primary recommendation is that the proposed mandatory 26 week sanction for a third or subsequent failure to comply with a New Deal Option should be replaced by a discretionary power to impose a sanction of up to 26 weeks,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0259">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
reflecting an assessment of whether or not the young person's failure represented a deliberate intention to flout the arrangements.</p></blockquote>
The Committee argued for a discretionary sanction, but the Government have stuck to their guns and made it mandatory. The need for discretion is recognised even in the United States, where people are happy to execute grandmothers and to show a draconian attitude to law and order. In that country, however, it is recognised that people can fall through the benefits system even for a third time, not necessarily through their own fault. Discretion was requested, but the Government turned their back on it. The Minister should ask his colleagues why they were not willing to consider it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new deal addresses people who have access to it. However, estimates have been made by Sheffield university that 600,000 people are economically detached—that is, not employed or on benefits. Does the Minister have any idea what that figure is in Scotland? Until we reach such people, we will not tackle the core of citizens who are completely detached from everyday society. We do not know how such people fund themselves; whether it is in the black economy, drug dealing or crime. We need to know whether the Government are seriously concerned about that and whether they are considering how to deal with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to take the new deal forward. The Secretary of State for Social Security said that the working families tax credit supports child care. We need more flexibility, because rural areas do not necessarily fit the rules for child care. Some solutions to child care problems might need that money but be unable to gain access to it. The system had to start with rigid rules, but it needs to be more flexible to help people in the real world, and not to treat them as statistics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State for Social Security was not able to answer my question about trying to encourage people into work. However, the minimum income guarantee and the working families tax credit may have an unexpected long-term effect. If people receive pay rises from their employers but have no more money in their pockets, they may not be so committed to employment. The Government must take care that they do not create a system that will grow out of control and condition people's behaviour, as has happened with housing benefit. I seek an undertaking that the Government will investigate how those benefits can work to condition behaviour. If the problem is not challenged soon, the next Government will have to pick up the pieces.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Greater flexibility in benefits offices would help. My right hon. Friend the Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (Mr. Maclennan) spoke about petrol tax increases. Whenever the Government increase petrol taxes, they keep saying that they plan to invest the money in roads and buses. Unfortunately, although many of the areas that we represent have perfectly good roads, they will never have buses on them. We need solutions that will allow people to stay within their rural economies but let them into the world of work. The Government must consider making tax concessions or subsidies for travel to work that would allow people to use their cars.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, benefit offices could be more imaginative. Many people working on the front line in benefits
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
offices can see problems and solutions, but they are constrained from suggesting some solutions because they work for a UK organisation with UK-wide rules. The Government should experiment and expand the pilot schemes, perhaps giving money to the benefit offices and allowing them to spend money in one direction that had been saved elsewhere. For instance, if a benefits office thought that jobs in village A could be filled by people in village B who were out of work but who could not take them because no bus service connected the two communities, it should not wait for someone else to pick up the tab; it should start a bus service to get those people into work. It would soon become self-sustaining. That sort of flexibility and imagination would allow the benefit office staff to help more people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new deal does not work in isolation. Many people are trapped by their housing needs and their inability to move to another area because of the cost. Mention has been made of the low unemployment in my constituency, but it is an extremely expensive place to live. Those who depend on housing benefit are trapped and, because of the cost, are unable to take the work where it is available. The Government are considering giving grants to help people to move, but they will have to tackle those other housing problems if they are to unlock people's mobility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State for Social Security touched on the need to invest to tackle poverty of opportunity. He spoke about the need to invest in education. We certainly have a problem, because the previous Government's funding of local authorities dramatically damaged education. At the general election, my constituents were not looking at the small details of the Labour party's manifesto, they were looking for change. However, because the Government decided to stick to Conservative spending guidelines for two years, they failed to make the investment necessary to tackle the poverty of opportunity. It was a wasted two years. The country was ready for change, but it has not been given it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In March, the Chancellor of the Exchequer must address that desire for change by ensuring proper funding for our public services. The Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Executive have a block grant, which is based on the spending commitments of English Ministers. The Chancellor's decisions on public finances, and the investment that he is willing to make in key services such as education and health, will decide how much money will be available for our constituents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Rosemary McKenna 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cumbernauld and Kilsyth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is appropriate that the Scottish Grand Committee should meet today to discuss an issue that is important to my constituents and to the whole of Scotland. The people of Cumbernauld and Kilsyth do not know what the fuss is about; they see how successful the relationship is between Members of the Scottish Parliament and Members of this Parliament, and how we work together, as do Westminster and Holyrood, to tackle our constituents' problems. They do not see why there should be such a fuss about the Grand Committee debating such an important matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My local newspaper, the 
	<i>Cumbernauld News and Kilsyth Chronicle,</i> which comes from the same stable as the local newspaper of my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty), is also extremely co-operative; it, too, provides our constituents with information on the issues that matter to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are two years into a Labour Government and we should remind ourselves of what we inherited. Many families in Scotland have suffered unemployment for three generations. Whole estates of people had no hope and no future, and many of those aged under 21 had never worked. They therefore had no role models and no example to follow. The under-25s had been in a succession of dead-end schemes and the over-50s found themselves on the scrap heap. Lone parents had no incentive, no hope and no help with child care. They felt excluded and no funding was made available to help them get to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the new deal was launched, many of us had great hopes of it, but we should also remind ourselves of the criticisms made of it. The Select committee on Scottish Affairs investigated the operation of welfare to work and the new deal. Much cynicism was expressed about the element of compulsion. It is important to remind ourselves that compulsion was thought likely to be counterproductive and it was felt that the Government should reconsider it. Much was made of that in the press. However, that has proved to be absolutely not the case. The young people were the judges of the new deal. Had they told their colleagues and friends that it was nothing but a repeat of an old scheme, it would not have been embraced as it has been. Young people saw real value in the new deal and
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
the opportunities that it gave them, so they proclaimed it a success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difference is in outcomes. The Secretary of State made it clear that three quarters of the young people concerned have been in sustained full-time jobs. Regardless of that, those who do not get a full-time job leave with real, transferable skills that they could not obtain in the past. That is the success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay tribute to Scott Taylor and the staff at Cumbernauld jobcentre. Very early on they embraced the whole new idea and culture of the jobcentre. The old relationship between client and staff, the animosity and antagonism, have gone. They worked with clients. It is a great credit to them that Cumbernauld and Kilsyth has had the biggest drop in unemployment in Scotland since 1997 and the 12th biggest drop in the United Kingdom since January 1996. Not only that, but there has been a drop of more than 80 per cent. in youth unemployment. That is a tremendous credit to those staff and entirely due to their working together to tackle problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today the jobcentre has four permanent staff members who were originally on the new deal programme, one recruited under new deal and, at present, two temporary staff members. One of the permanent staff members was on the new deal for the lone parent programme. Not only has the jobcentre helped people into work, it has actually taken on people through the new deal. It will also pilot a 50-plus new deal in April, which will be voluntary for people over 50 who have been unemployed for six months, and a new deal for people over 25 who have been employed for 18 months or more. The latter involves 13 weeks' intensive activity, based on Cumbernauld colleges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many hon. Members have received information from the Association of Scottish Colleges, raising some important issues. Education is crucial to people's success in long-term work. Setting out the present position the association states:
	<br><blockquote><p>A confirmed job placing is the only criteria of success in the New Deal Programme and the only basis for payment to colleges.</p></blockquote>
It asks, however, that the undertaking of
	<br><blockquote><p>further study—in either Further Education or Higher Education—should be recognised as a positive outcome and consistent with the government agenda of encouraging lifelong learning.</p></blockquote>
I agree, and ask the Minister to take those ideas on board. Can we assist the colleges in this regard, as it would be in the interest of the country?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Association of Scottish Colleges also comments on the local job market—an issue that involves travel-to-work areas and people's resistance to moving out of their area. I am glad that the Chancellor is to encourage people to move away from areas of deep unemployment and help them to move to areas of full employment. One of the best ways of helping with that is to tackle transport. There is a need for good, affordable public transport to areas of high employment where jobs are available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that the new deal is working well, but we must continue to track clients and learn from experience to help the areas with more difficult problems. For areas of deep poverty in Scotland employment is the route out. That is something that we find difficult to tackle.

I suspect that the debate about what Members of Parliament do at Westminster is resurrected in the Scottish press on a slow news day. Of course the Grand Committee is right to meet and discuss matters that are reserved for Westminster. I hope that we shall meet in Scotland in the future. Scots have an interest in taxation, benefits and employment. I suspect that as Budget day approaches that may increase.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. John Swinney 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Tayside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to have the opportunity to take part in the debate and that the Secretary of State has managed to double his attendance at Grand Committee meetings during this Parliament by attending today. Two out of 14 over three years is not the most impressive attendance record but it is better than nothing and compares well with the speaking record of some of his hon. Friends on the Back Benches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today's debate is about the new deal and youth unemployment, and the Secretary of State has been doing a bit of employment creation for himself. An increase of 138 per cent. in his budget, and as many special advisers as previous Secretaries of State, is not bad going. The cost of running his little Department over the first three years of the Parliament could have bought 80 new nursing jobs a year for Scotland's hard-pressed hospitals. That would be real employment and, in most Scots minds, a better use of resources than the Scottish Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State has increased his staff and resources and even since the creation of the Scottish Parliament he has cut his work load by transferring responsibility after responsibility to United Kingdom Departments. I suppose that it is little wonder that he has brought about the rebirth of the Grand Committee. It gives him and his special advisers something to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State bills himself as Scotland's voice in the Cabinet, reflecting Scotland's interest in reserved matters. Some might accuse him of being the Cabinet's voice in Scotland. I am sure that he will have been monitoring the performance of the Minister for employment, welfare to work and equal opportunities, the right hon. Member for Dulwich and West Norwood, on the television programme "On the Record". In contrast to the Secretary of State's ebullient speech today, the Minister for the New Deal was forced to adopt a slightly more transparent approach to the real impact of the new deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was initially forced to admit that 25 per cent, or 44,000, of the 175,000 jobs that the Government claim to have created through the new deal have been short term. Most of the people concerned returned to the dole queues. She was then forced to admit that most of the new jobs claimed for the new deal were, in fact, created as a result of general economic conditions. She said:
	<br><blockquote><p>Well I think that is a very important conclusion from the macro-economic evaluation and it is … that is the numerical calculation that the New Deal effect in the period that the research took, the first year of the New Deal, was about thirty thousand jobs arose precisely because of the New Deal.</p></blockquote>
Her words might have been jumbled, but the message was clear: not 175,000 jobs in a year and a half, but 30,000 in one year, arose from the new deal. The Government are good at making overblown claims, but I hope that the Secretary of State will match the Minister's transparency, and give us the true figures for the number of jobs arising from the new deal. That would be a more transparent framework for the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
[Mr. JIMMY HOOD 
	<i>in the Chair</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Figures from the Library suggest that youth unemployment in Scotland fell by 5,000 between autumn 1997 and autumn 1999, while the UK drop was 37,000—in line with the Minister's admission on television. Is that not closer to the true figure for the impact in Scotland of the new deal on our young people? The SNP welcomes any effort to assist young people back into the work force, but the more realistic figures for the new deal suggest that it has not given the UK as substantial a return as an investment of £5.5 billion might have suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are structural flaws in the scheme. First, it is designed to help young people to find work, not to assist in the creation of employment. There will be few opportunities for the young or long-term unemployed when there is no work, no matter how often the Chancellor of the Exchequer exhorts our young unemployed to get on their bikes to find work. Five of the 10 Glasgow constituencies are consistently in the bottom 10 for unemployment, having more than
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0262">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
double the national average rate, in some cases. Our largest city clearly has a structural problem. Although presentation, training and confidence-building skills will help, they can be only part of the solution. The new deal has failed to reach many of our young people in unemployment blackspots—it has opened the new deal gateway but failed to deliver new, real and long-term sustainable jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the new deal helps those most able to help themselves, rather than targeting those who would have most difficulty in the workplace. I shall quote from the "On The Record" programme which we discussed earlier, and from the research from Sheffield university to which the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir R. Smith) referred. One of the researchers was quoted in the programme as saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>We found that … a third of the young people who go through New Deal end up with jobs six months after New Deal. We found in our own research that the third that was in jobs came from socio-economic backgrounds and from educational backgrounds that would have predisposed them for this. In other words, they came from good middle class backgrounds. And so one might argue that the New Deal has actually not had any impact on those for whom it was designed, namely those who didn't have the qualifications and the backgrounds to get jobs.</p></blockquote>
The presenter said:
	<br><blockquote><p>So the evidence is that the better educated benefit most from the New Deal. The government's flagship policy does little to improve the job prospects of a hardcore of the young, unskilled unemployed. And if a city's local economy is in decline and jobs are scarce the New Deal can't, in itself, offer the youth a bright future.</p></blockquote>
That is a more realistic assessment of the difficulties with which we are wrestling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the greatest benefit of the new deal scheme has been seen in areas of high economic growth, the least benefit in the north and in rural areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. McKenna</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman trying to undermine the work that has been done by continually referring to the new deal as a scheme? I made it clear in my contribution that young people regard it not as a scheme but as a real step on the ladder to full-time employment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know why the hon. Lady is so edgy about the new deal being described as a scheme—the term may be used to address a programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The least economic benefit was in the north and in rural areas. The right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross has made several well-argued points today about the practical difficulties that impede people's participation in the new deal, such as travel and access problems. The unemployment rate is increasing in the right hon. Gentleman's constituency, in the Ross, Skye and Inverness, West constituency, and in the Western Isles. That shows that the climate of the Government's economic policies, and their impact on rural areas, impedes the effectiveness of the new deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, the new deal does not touch a large proportion of those excluded in Scotland. I am sure that many Government Members have read some of the thoughts of Demos, the left-of-centre think tank. It has estimated that the new deal has failed to reach about 500,000 of the UK's most marginalised young people, including 40,000 located in Scotland. Of the latter
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
group, 13,000 are 16 to 17-year-olds who have left school but who are not in training or work, and who do not receive benefits; 12,500 are the hidden unemployed, looking for work but not receiving benefits; 3,200 are in part-time study, are young mothers or carers, or are among the many others lost by the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Studies, including one by the unemployment unit, suggest that, when such people are found and are covered by the new deal, the most socially excluded are the likeliest to lose benefits as a result of the scheme instead of finding work. About 10 per cent. of participants lose benefit, and others are forced to give up part-time work or study to participate in one of the programmes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the reality of the new deal scheme. It has done little for job creation and it might have squeezed older job seekers out of the jobs market as employers have taken on new dealers with their subsidies. The Government's own statistics substantiate that fear. The recently published Scottish economic report noted that the unemployment rate for the over-25s was falling at almost one quarter of the rate of that for 18 to 25-year-olds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to quote too many statistics, but it is useful to compare the performance of the new deal in Scotland with its performance in Great Britain. We have already shown that the scheme has structural weaknesses and that it is poorly targeted. The statistics show that the general UK problems are more serious in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have highlighted the problems of preparing many of the most marginalised young unemployed—those with the poorest literacy and numeracy skills—for the workplace. I am concerned that significantly fewer participants in Scotland enter the training or education options—entry was 15 per cent. below the average for Great Britain on November 1999's figures. Most enter the subsidised employment option, but fewer of them—9.4 per cent. below the average for Great Britain—are offered sustained, unsubsidised employment at the end of the new deal period. If the new deal is about anything, it is about training and getting our young people long-term jobs. On both counts, the new deal in Scotland is performing well below the UK average.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State might mention factors such as the higher unemployment rates for the young unemployed and for the unemployed generally in Scotland than in the UK as explanations for the differences. The argument might be that the problem is greater in Scotland, and so will take longer to fix. However, that should not be the defence—the factors are part of my criticism of the Government's economic and employment policies. On the most recent House of Commons Library figures, the youth unemployment rate in Scotland is 1.2 per cent. above the UK average. The number of economically inactive young people in Scotland has dramatically increased from 75,000 in 1997 to 96,000 in 1999, according to the Scottish economic report that has just been published. The new deal is delivering less for Scotland and for those most in need, and nothing for the large proportion who are excluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have quoted one academic study that has highlighted concerns about the new deal: and I shall draw my remarks to a close with a view from two angles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to acknowledge that a pilot initiative took place in the area.

If I have offended the hon. Gentleman by omitting to mention the pilot exercise, I hope that I have now put the matter right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that I would draw my remarks to a close with points from a couple of angles. The Minister will be aware that the Scottish Trades Union Congress expressed concerns about protection for new deal workers. Months on, the Scottish poverty investigation unit has investigated whether the STUC's concerns have been taken on board. In its report, it suggests that the Employment Service is not monitoring many basic employment standards. It would have been useful had a Department for Education and Employment Minister been present to respond to those substantive points, as ministerial responsibility for them lies in that Department.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Secretary of State for Social Security has no direct ministerial responsibility for any of the issues under consideration.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I want to draw my remarks to a close. I shall get into difficulty with you, Mr. Hood, if I do not do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister tell us whether the Employment Service has acted on the concerns of the Scottish Trades Union Congress and of the Scottish poverty unit and begun basic monitoring of employment standards and wages paid under the new deal? When I was preparing for the debate, I received a number of interesting communications. Some came from employers, who expressed concerns about a variety of matters, including the length of the gateway period, basic information about new deal employees, timing of their arrival and even extension of the scheme to 16 and 17-year-olds. I understand that the Government are considering reducing, if anything, the gateway period, especially for the most marginalised people in our community, but it should be extended to respond more positively to participants and employers' needs. That is
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
some of the feedback that I have heard about the new deal, and I hope that the Government will deal with the issues of under-performance in Scotland that I have mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall conclude by returning to a point that I discussed with the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine during an intervention. Press reports released at the weekend suggested that the student finance deal made in the Scottish Parliament would be paid for by cuts in the Scottish enterprise training budget, because that money is duplicated by money made available through the new deal. There is a problem with that approach. The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) questioned the previous Secretary of State for Scotland in a Scottish Grand Committee sitting that occurred before the election. He asked where sustainable finance would come from for training young people in Scotland after the new deal and the windfall tax had dried up. The Scottish Executive might be giving up training resources to a policy programme that is led and delivered by a United Kingdom Department with United Kingdom resources and which has no security on where those resources will come from in future years. All of the serious issues that I have mentioned concerned unemployment blackspots, the cities of Scotland and poorly performing areas will not be addressed by such steps.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are wrestling with the anomalies and difficulties created by the fact that there has been no true and effective devolution to Scotland. An important aspect of policy is still reserved to Westminster that should come into the province of consideration in the Scottish Parliament—issues of economic development and employment creation. We need to do better and to do more for the young unemployed in Scotland. I hope that the next debate on the new deal will occur in the context of Scottish economic development and that it will be held in the Scottish Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity to take part in this important debate about the new deal programme, which has brought great opportunities to thousands of people in Scotland. As Scottish Members, we all have a duty to ensure that the policies on important matters reserved at Westminster work in the best interests of the people of Scotland. Whatever the forum, we have an obligation to debate and scrutinise this flagship Government policy on behalf of young people, the long-term unemployed, lone parents and disabled people in our constituencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I begin by paying tribute to the Employment Service in my constituency and throughout Scotland for all its work during the past two years in delivering the new deal and making it the success that I believe it has become. At the start, many sceptics warned that business would not back the new deal, and that the Government would end up in court over proposals to tax the excess profits of the privatised utilities to the sum of £3.5 billion. They were undoubtedly wrong. At a time when the Labour party is celebrating 100 years in being, the press is running stories asking what has happened to redistribution. We need only to look at this example, in which money was taken from the excess profits of privatised utilities and used to benefit the less fortunate in society, to see how the Government have tackled redistribution.

	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
The new deal is helping hundreds of my constituents, as well as many people in other areas. It is helping to give Britain the highest level of employment in history. The statistics speak for themselves. More than 21,000 young people, including more than 400 in my constituency, gained jobs through the new deal in Scotland. More than 80 per cent. of those jobs are not subsidised, despite the predictions of the doom and gloom merchants on the Opposition Benches, who said that when the subsidy ended, so would the job. That is helping to tackle the scourge of unemployment. Since the general election, unemployment in my constituency has decreased by 19 per cent. but among the new deal client group, the decrease is even more impressive; youth unemployment has fallen by 57 per cent. and long-term unemployment has fallen by 40 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to the new deal for young people and the long-term unemployed, there is also the new deal for lone parents. As hon. Members know, it is up to lone parents to decide whether to choose to join the new deal, but they are choosing to join. The Employment Service in my locality covers Ayrshire and Dumfries and Galloway. In that area, 681 lone parents have taken part in the initial interview, 634 of whom—an astonishing 93.1 per cent.—came back for the second part of the process. Some 245 of those lone parents have already entered new jobs—I emphasise, new jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The news in the rest of Scotland is the same. More than 7,300 lone parents have attended the initial interview, of which almost 6,800 have returned for the second part of the new deal. The new deal is working as a result not only of what is being done, but of how it is being done. When I spoke to members of staff at the Employment Service at the introduction of the new deal, they said, "At long last, we will be able to do what we have been trained to do. We can best utilise our skills to encourage people who find themselves in the unfortunate position of being unemployed." There is no longer the idea that the first dozen people who come through the door will be channelled off in a direction that they might not even have wanted to consider. The new deal is about fitting people in where they can best use their skills and wherever is most appropriate. The Employment Service has been liberated from the previous regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to the hon. Member for North Tayside (Mr. Swinney) and the right hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (Mr. Maclennan), I admit that certain issues exist surrounding the rules, but there are ways and means of considering those difficulties. It is all about innovation, and we should consider the differences between those areas and some of our larger cities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With money from the innovation fund, the Dumfries and Galloway career service purchased a bus, which has allowed it to run induction days for clients in the more remote areas and to inform them of the full range of opportunities available to them. New deal clients in the region are being offered subsidised bus travel from Stagecoach, whose bosses are spending their large wealth, at least on this occasion, on something worth while.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also heard that clients in more rural areas have access to the Royal Mail post bus—that is innovation, and it is working well. Video conferencing was also introduced in Dumfries and Galloway to allow people to study near their homes while benefiting from the expertise of a lecturer at a college outwith the area.
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
Recently, when the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs visited my constituency to hear what the Employment Service and young people had to say, some outstanding tributes were paid to the Government for tackling the problems that have been the scourge of local communities for many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that the new deal is working in rural and urban areas alike, because we have a Government who believe that unemployment is not, and never could be, a price worth paying. For 20 years, people assumed that long-term unemployment was just a fact of life; unfortunate but unavoidable. Now, for the first time in a generation, the prospect of achieving full employment for young people is again in sight, but we cannot rest on our laurels. There are still some difficulties, which we need to work our way through. The priority now is to ensure that we move forward and that the new deal is improved, wherever necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Secretary of State will help to ensure that the new deal continues and that its flexibility increases to meet the distinctive problems faced by the unemployed in rural areas. Some employers are still not fully satisfied about the job readiness of some of the young people being sent to them, and, again, we need to increase flexibility to ensure that those young people will be better prepared.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No other Government have ever halved long-term youth unemployment in just two years, but this Government have. Combined with the national minimum wage, the largest increase in child benefit, cuts in business taxes and the introduction of the working families tax credit, the Government are delivering social justice and the economic efficiency that the nation deserves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas Alexander 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Paisley, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to have this opportunity to speak about an issue that is close to the hearts of many of my constituents. It is especially appropriate that, at the first meeting of the Scottish Grand Committee since the centenary of the Labour party, we are addressing an issue that has long been held dear by the Labour movement—how to tackle mass and long-term unemployment. Throughout that century, the right to work has been a central demand of the Labour party, whether by the Jarrow marchers or the upper Clyde shipyard stewards closer to home. The Labour party has always recognised that the opportunity to work is not just a right, but the surest way out of poverty. Therefore, I wish to focus on two points in my contribution: first, the economic context of the specific policies of the new deal and, secondly, the specific impact of the new deal in my constitutency. I also want to make a couple of requests to the Secretary of State regarding further steps that I hope the Government will take in relation to the gateway to the new deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the past 20 years, mass unemployment has become the norm in Scotland and it is important, especially in the light of some of the comments that have been made by Opposition Members, to remind the Committee of the scale of the Government's achievements. In Scotland, 2.3 million people are now in work and unemployment is at its lowest for a generation. That success has been matched throughout Britain, where more than 800,000 jobs have been created since May 1997. That has been achieved not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0265">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
only through initiatives such as the new deal, but also by securing something that has been so difficult for British Governments to secure—a combination of genuine economic stability and steady growth. We are now proving that the contradiction that seemed to exist during the 1980s, that there was a choice between enterprise and fairness—that one could be cruel and efficient, but not caring and effective at the same time—has been left behind by a new economic approach that marries policies of social justice and economic efficiency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that regard, it is appropriate that today's discussion of the new deal was preceded by discussion of anti-poverty measures in Scotland. The new deal should not be seen in isolation but as part of a coherent Government approach to providing work, ensuring that work can pay and standing on the side of hardworking families by reducing their cost of living, especially through taxation. We will see evidence of that approach in the coming budget, which will make another cut in the basic rate of income tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Moore 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would be interested to hear what the hon. Gentleman would say to one of my constituents, Mrs. Doreen Thomson from Galashiels, who is a member of Unison and an ancillary worker at Borders general hospital. She wrote an open letter to the Secretary of State for Health, in which she comments:
	<br><blockquote><p>We feel we are the forgotten people in the NHS.</p></blockquote>
The letter states:
	<br><blockquote><p>Over the last three years we have only had a 9p per hour rise, which brings us to £3.89.</p></blockquote>
It goes on to state:
	<br><blockquote><p>This is surely a poverty payment and insult to the kind of work we do.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take on board the hon. Gentleman's points and I can offer two responses. First, I refer to the funding of the national health service. Earlier, a colleague of the hon. Gentleman seemed to suggest that the Government had failed by not addressing public finances in their first two years in office. I remind the Committee of the reality of the mess of the public finances that we inherited and of the sheer scale of the Government's ambition in funding the national health service. We made the largest ever funding increase in the health service, and we should not forget that that increase will have started flowing into Scottish hospitals since last March. The Government are committed to investment in the public services and to the health service in particular. I contrast that approach with Liberal Democrat policy on such matters. If I recollect correctly, the Liberal Democrats made a commitment to a 1p increase in income tax for education, but I do not remember with any clarity their position on health service funding. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will elucidate later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, poverty pay is another substantive point. The Labour party has been committed to a minimum wage for 100 years. Within the past two years, we have achieved a massive rise in employment and 800,000 jobs have been created throughout Britain. I repeat that that contradicts Conservative scare stories, which predicted
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
that a minimum wage would cost up to 1 million jobs—a view articulated by the now Shadow Chancellor. As well as creating those jobs we have put in place a range of policies, including not just the minimum wage but the minimum income guarantee for pensioners and the working families tax credit, which was discussed earlier. We have a comprehensive anti-poverty strategy. Of course, more work must be done, and I honour the fact that many people still need opportunity and security. However, I am convinced now more than ever that opportunity and security are the way forward with a Labour Government rather than with any other Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Swinney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it part of the Government's commitment to the health service to have been the first Administration in the post-war period ever to have cut expenditure on the health service in real terms? That is what the Labour Government did in Scotland in their first year in office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I notice the delicacy with which the hon. Gentleman chooses his statistics. He is obviously unwilling to acknowledge in the Committee not just the eight new hospitals that the Government are building but the massive rise in investment since March.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me turn to how the new deal is affecting Paisley, South, a constituency that lies within the Renfrewshire economy and which is long remembered as a manufacturing heartland in Scotland. It is not remembered as such just because of the Paisley mills, but, in my lifetime, because of the Linwood car plant. Renfrewshire has been economically successful during recent years; indeed, it generates one third of Scotland's manufactured exports. It also generates about 15 per cent. of the total gross domestic product of the west of Scotland and 6 per cent. of the Scottish total. However, I concede that the £5.5 billion worth of exports is concentrated in too few large companies. One of the challenges for the Renfrewshire economy, which is shared by many other constituencies across the country, is to expand those opportunities from a limited number of companies to the whole labour market. Renfrewshire faces that significant challenge, in common with many other communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be appropriate at this juncture to give the Committee a sense of the impact of the Government's economic policies within the Renfrewshire economy. Since January 1996, youth unemployment in my constituency has virtually halved; it has fallen by 45.9 per cent. That can partly be attributed to the success of the new deal. We have heard the national statistics today: 44,000 young people have started the new deal in Scotland and more than 21,000 young people have found permanent jobs through it. I strongly contest the suggestion that the statistics show that the new deal has been anything other than a significant success for young people in Scotland, which was implicit in the remarks made by the hon. Member for North Tayside (Mr. Swinney). It is important to recognise that the new deal is only one part of a programme that is making success in the Renfrewshire economy a reality for many young people. There are 912 people currently on the new deal in Renfrewshire. Since the start of the scheme, 2,760 young people have taken part in the new deal and 872—nearly one third—have managed to find sustained employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The success of the new deal is due partly to the work of effective local partnerships. Other hon. Members
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0266">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
have spoken of the success of the local partnerships in their communities, and I do the same for Renfrewshire. Many organisations, including the Renfrewshire careers partnership, Renfrewshire council and the local Employment Service, have played a significant role in tackling youth unemployment. However, in my discussions with them, those agencies have made it clear that further work needs to be done, particularly in relation to the gateway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to speak to each of the following issues. First, it is a matter of great pride to me—and, I am sure, to the Minister—that the proportion of firms in Scotland who have offered places under the new deal is higher than in the rest of the United Kingdom. Howeve, we must be certain that, in honouring that commitment, those who are being offered to Scottish employers are indeed job ready. The gateway has been tremendously successful in ensuring that people are ready for work, but we are now reaching a core of people who will have significant difficulties in being job ready. I ask my hon. Friend to elucidate on the steps that can be taken to ensure that when people arrive in companies in Renfrewshire, they are properly equipped for the work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, what steps are the Employment Service taking to ensure that the assessment of the needs of those people who are eligible for the new deal is accurate? A tremendous amount of work has been done by the staff of the local Employment Service. It has been a radical transformation of their job: from being the guardians at the gate, stopping people having access to welfare, they are now doing what they much prefer—being genuine counsellors, mentors and advisers, helping people through the gateway. That significant range of skills has been developed in a short time. From my discussions with some of the other partners, I know that they are keen to ensure that that work continues. They want to ensure that Employment Service employees are themselves well equipped for the assessment that needs to take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I bring to the Committee's attention an example of the new deal in operation in my constituency. I had the great privilege of meeting several Prince's Trust volunteers before Christmas, at the start of their 12-week programme. It is a measure of the success of the new deal in my community that when I next met them at their graduation in February, three had already secured work and were leaving the programme. More significant was the fact that when I asked those young people about their experience of the new deal, gone was the language of the schemes mentioned by the hon. Member for North Tayside, gone was any mention of YTS and YOPS which I remember from my youth. Those young people recognise the reality of the opportunities that they are being given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I pay tribute to the work of the Government, I can think of no greater tribute than to say that the people of Paisley, particularly the young people of Paisley, recognise the success of the new deal. That can be seen from the way in which they describe the programme, and in the hope and the sense of opportunity that is now a tangible reality. The programme will develop, as it still has much to do. I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I enjoyed listening to the speech of the hon. Member for Paisley, South (Mr. Alexander), and I acknowledge his expertise. I also acknowledge what the Government have done. However, I wish to spend a moment or two discussing some of the philosophical aspects of the new deal; I shall then talk about the problems of rural areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will not try to claim too much for the new deal. It has been in operation since April 1998 and it is an important programme; it is one of the Government's flagship policies. I believe that it would have happened in any event, because the previous Government were moving in that direction. Indeed, some in the Department of Social Security were considering active support measures to move people from welfare into work. However, there is no doubt that the Chancellor of the Exchequer and other new Labour Ministers have given it major impetus, for which they deserve credit. I do not want anything that I say to diminish that, but I hope that we will not make too many extravagant claims about what is happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are trying to establish a culture change that should be judged over five or 10 years, not two. Although I understand that it is a matter for the Chancellor's comprehensive spending review later in the year, it is important to reassure us that the programme will be financed for five or 10 years. We may disagree on the mechanism for raising the money, as we did when the new deal was introduced, but, if the Government are claiming that the programme is successful—I believe that it is—we are right to look to them to sustain it in the long term. We must ensure that it receives long-term funding and that successes are kept in context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Supply-side measures are not enough. The Government are beginning to accept that the statistics show regional disparities. I hope that the press reports of what might be in the Budget are to be believed. If we are setting out a policy that is based on statutory rights—a new deal backed by a social security programme—it is important to tackle areas where the labour market has collapsed and training can better equip young people to participate in the work force. David Webster's work at Glasgow university cannot be ignored. It is essential to provide job creation schemes in places where there are no jobs. It is not just a matter of supply; job creation must be involved in the long term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, we must be careful not to think that we abolish poverty by putting people into low-paid jobs. According to the statistics, much of the poverty in this country exists in families that have one member of the household in work, because that work is often low paid, temporary or part time. Getting people off the unemployment register is not the end of the story.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the previous Parliament, the Minister of State played a major and honourable part in attacking the veracity of the unemployment claimant count as a measure of unemployment, because it was nothing of the kind. Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will recognise that the number of people who are registered as claiming unemployment benefit still does not begin to reflect the true measure of worklessness. We must not be complacent about the statistics, including the recent welcome drop in the unemployment claimant count. There are problems with trying to get people into work and making work available to all our constituents who want it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0267">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
Finally, I was pleased that we mentioned sanctions. We have the opportunity to examine the policy as it has unfolded in the United States, which has had an active welfare-to-work programme for a long time. Although the context is different, I am concerned about the twin problems of stigmatising people who cannot get into the labour market because of a disability or for other bona fide reasons. If we take the messianic view of No. 10, we might stigmatise people who cannot work. The obverse of that is sanctions, which I am worried are the thin end of the wedge. The 26-week benefit sanction, which is mandatory and without discretion, allows three hits—three refusals—within 12 months, but the benefit withdrawal is 26 weeks for 18 to 24-year-olds. That will recycle people into homelessness and no jobs. The people we sanction will need to be supported with hardship payments, which cause trouble for everyone. The social security system has to come into play, making it necessary to determine whether people are pregnant or disabled. It is a sledgehammer to crack a nut of 1 per cent. Although less than 1 per cent. of participants are currently affected, that figure is increasing. I admit that those who are swinging the lead need to be dealt with, but they represent only a tiny proportion. Not to allow adjudication officers genuine discretion about punishing—that is the right word—those who abuse the system is different from keeping a proper sense of perspective on the difficulties experienced by some people who leave the programmes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Reid</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall make just one quick point, as my hon. Friend the Minister of State will be summing up. I understand the hon. Gentleman's concerns and we have considered those matters too. However, it must be recognised that the new deal is different from the schemes that disguised unemployment in the past. It involves far more personal involvement, personal advice, personal tailoring and personal contact than any previous scheme. That should mitigate at least some of the hon. Gentleman's fears.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not—it exacerbates them. I agree that the difference about the new deal is that, for the first time, personal advisers will be involved. They will drill into the relevant problems, they will know the background circumstances and they will be in a position to make a judgment about whether someone is swinging the lead. All that I and the Social Security Advisory Committee ask for is an element of discretion. We are not talking about dealing with people who abuse the system. I agree about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Secretary of State read the document that the Social Security Advisory Committee produced last week? It contains a lot of sense. I worry that the approach that is now being taken will be extended to the over-50s when their scheme is introduced. It is inimical to the long-term interest of the new deal programme, and I am astonished that those on the Front Bench today are willing to sign up to this stuff. I am genuinely concerned and hope that the Secretary of State will consider the matter carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am interested in the working of the new deal in rural areas. The problems there are different and the Department's estimate of the volume of entrants to the gateway has not been fulfilled. There are cogent reasons for that. Perhaps the Secretary of State would do me the kindness of reading the Social Security Advisory Committee document.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: He has already read it. I beg his pardon. Two documents that he may not have read, produced recently by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, are "Young people in rural Scotland" and "Youth unemployment in rural areas". They repay careful study. They are based on assessments, one of which took place in my constituency. The researchers asked young people how things were shaping up in rural areas. I do not have time to do justice to the conclusions, but there is clearly a lack of diverse opportunities for young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A key finding that should not surprise any of us was that educational attainment is one of the main drivers of exclusion. The Government have only recently started to put significant sums of public money into the education system. It will be interesting to see what happens when some of those resources begin to feed through. I hope that it will help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lack of transport is clearly significant. I see from press reports today that the Chancellor might be considering that problem, with a view to giving people grants to get to work, which is right. We should think about giving people free driving tests if such obstacles are stopping them from getting to work. In an innovative programme in the Borders, the bus company and a local enterprise company each pay 45 per cent. of the travel costs, and the young person participating in the new deal pays only 10 per cent. That is working well and we want to promote such schemes, but we need an outreach programme for rural areas. We need someone to try to work out how to develop the best practices and systematically apply them to rural areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman. Does he agree that in the rural area of west Fife, a combination of Government policies and partnership between the local college, the Employment Service, the community and the council has already established learning centres in some of the most deprived communities, such as High Valleyfield and Oakley? Does he agree that if the vision is there, the Government's policies can deliver for rural communities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know there are such projects, which I welcome.

There is a lack of demand for qualified workers in rural areas. Rural employers have a long way to go before they even begin to understand and appreciate the full benefits of the new deal. They are mainly small employers, and they may need help better to understand what is going on, but I believe that their ignorance needs to be addressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Child care facilities are particularly difficult to arrange in rural areas; another problem is the shortage of affordable housing; I shall leave copies of those reports with the Secretary of State.

It is a long-term scheme that could change our culture; if they succeed they will deserve credit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scotland Office (Mr. Brian Wilson)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: All right hon. and hon. Members will agree that it has been a good debate. I do not want to waste time on the question of whether the Committee should have met today; self-evidently, it should have done so. Many useful points have been raised, which I shall certainly take forward. For the record, I make it absolutely clear that the arrangements for this and other sittings of the Scottish Grand Committee were made with full consultation, through the usual channels, and no objections were voiced. Anyone who wishes to draw conclusions from that, or from the subsequent public utterances from some quarters, is more than entitled to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) used the word "messianic". I confess that I am messianic about the new deal. However, I am utterly uninterested in engaging in political rhetoric about it. I am in politics to try to change people's life prospects for the better. I believe that we should be able to unite around that aim and talk clearly, as did the hon. Gentleman, about how it can be improved, developed and enhanced. It is self-evident that the new deal is delivering for many people. The principle should not be in doubt. People would have to be intellectually twisted to deride and denigrate the new deal, because it is delivering for many people, including those young people who had previously had little or no hope. As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said, you can see from their eyes that it has given them something. That is why the new deal is so important; make no mistake, despite all the caveats that were fairly raised today, it is delivering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall try to deal directly with as many points as I can. The hon. Members for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir R. Smith) and for Gordon (Mr. Bruce) said that it is too soon to judge the new deal. I could not agree more; it is not a finite solution. They were also right to say that other factors are at work in lowering the rate of unemployment and youth unemployment. However, independent studies show that 50 per cent. of the reduction in the level of youth unemployment is attributable to the new deal. That is an awful lot of young people in jobs who would not otherwise be employed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's commitment to the new deal was for the lifetime of this Parliament. We used a novel funding mechanism. I say without rancour that we did it on our own; there was no political support for our imposing a windfall tax on the utilities, but the privatised utilities have survived pretty well, despite the tax. We may now be unanimous that the Chancellor's judgment was right and that the windfall tax was a price well worth the utilities paying. Not only were we committed to the end—to a dramatic reduction in youth unemployment—but we had the political courage to will the means through the windfall tax.

The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire fairly raised the issue of sanctions. They are right. I am not one of life's natural sanction imposers and I do not think that many Labour Members are, but, like my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, in the light of experience I defend 100 per cent. the decision to include sanctions in the new deal package. The best people to judge whether that is the big deal that some people have tried to make of it are the new deal clients. The story was that thousands of disillusioned people
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
would be alienated and would not want anything to do with the programme because of the sanctions element. The remarkable thing about the new deal, however, is not how widely but how modestly sanctions are used and how seldom the issue arises. That tells me and the people involved that all this stuff about the new deal client group consisting of people who do want to work, are lazy and idle, who would go to great lengths to dodge work and all the rest of it, is not true. The vast majority of people eligible for the new deal desperately want to take part in it, to get jobs and to obtain the advantages that flow from it. That is why the issue of sanctions so seldom arises. If there were no sanctions, the arrangements would not only be unfair to employers and to those who are providing funding and putting work into the new deal, but to the 99 per cent. of participants who have entered willingly into the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of sanctions cannot be dealt with on its own. It must be considered alongside the culture change that has taken place in the Employment Service, of which the new deal has been at the forefront. Anyone who tries to present the image of a hard-faced organisation looking for ways to impose sanctions on young people has not been in a jobcentre recently. I am not saying that the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire is making such a suggestion, but I remind him that the images tend to go hand in hand. The employment centre staff who are dealing with the new deal will move heaven and earth to avoid imposing sanctions and to avoid circumstances in which three offers are turned down and in which sanctions must be imposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Wholesale sanctions are not being imposed because the vast majority of unemployed people want to work. As my right hon.

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Pollok)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I pick up on the Minister's point about the very few people to whom sanctions are applied? I draw his attention to what I think is a larger group—the disappeared. I am speaking of those who do not get to the stage of having sanctions applied to them because they disappear from the project earlier on. In the light of the Secretary of State's theme of doing well but there being much still to do, does the Minister accept that we do not seem to have the answers for that group? Does he accept that a substantial number of youngsters, especially in constituencies such as my own, are still being failed by the scheme and are drifting away, even though the scheme is far better than any programme that we had before?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I accept that, and I was going to make a similar point. The new deal has done a tremendous amount, but the figures that are used to try to undermine it by showing how many people go out the

	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
other end or through the revolving door demonstrate not the failure of the new deal but the extent of the problem. Once we get down to a core group of really difficult cases, the figures will get worse before they get better. That is not a condemnation of the new deal but a tribute to the realism with which the problem is being approached. We are putting in resources and effort to crack the most difficult cases. We are not interested in cosmetic statistics—we could make the statistics much more cosmetic by excluding some of the difficult cases—we must consider the reality of the situation. Some of those young people are, perhaps, the third generation in their families to be unemployed. That is difficult to crack, but resources must be made available and we must get the new deal right so that those cases can be solved, which is what we are trying to do. Anyone who says that the Government do not have a 100 per cent. record, and anyone who quotes statistics to show that the new deal is a failure and a fraud, is a fool, because that person does not recognise the scale of the problem or the seriousness of the attempt to solve it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to the speech of the hon. Member for North Tayside (Mr. Swinney) which was a disgrace. In relation to the new deal, Tayside is not just any old area; it was one of four pilot areas in the United Kingdom. A fantastic amount of work has been done to develop the new deal in Tayside, yet the hon. Gentleman did not find it in whatever grace he has remaining to him to mention one word about the work being done by Bob Alexander and his staff at the Employment Service in Tayside, by the local enterprise in Tayside and by the three local authorities of all political complexions. He was interested only in a litany of meaningless statistics drawn from reports that he presumably found—or someone found for him—in a library, most of which did not even apply to Scotland. I will ensure that his speech is well reported in Tayside. However, I will do what he should have done and pay tribute to everyone who has worked together, from the first day of the pilot scheme of the new deal, without political affiliation, in order to make the new deal a success in Tayside.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth (Mrs. McKenna) touched on the deep-rooted nature of the problem. Anyone with any sensitivity or understanding knows that she is right. The problem lies deep within communities and will not be sorted out in two years by the new deal alone, but if we do not begin to face up to it, we will never crack the
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
whole problem of youth unemployment. As my hon. Friend said, the new deal is closely linked with the wider agenda for tackling povery, because unless there is work in communities there will be poverty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend referred to transport. Money is available for transport and, in special cases, even more money will be available. One of the great things about the new deal is its flexibility and ability to take account of individual circumstances. Local partnerships are administering the new deal and advising on it. Local authorities can also be involved, but if there are specific cases, I should be pleased to hear about how transport can be improved. I also heard what she said about payments to colleges. I am familiar with the problem and will write to my hon. Friend about that. I am pleased that, like my hon. Friends the Members for Dumfries (Mr. Brown) and for Paisley, South (Mr. Alexander), my hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth paid tribute to the local Employment Service and jobcentre staff. They know what work is being done, the culture change that has taken place and the benefits to all our constitutents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Paisley, South spoke about the additional help that is needed to prepare young people for jobs. He is right. I discussed that recently with the WISE group and I am discussing it with fellow Ministers because the key is not only to get people into employment but to make them employable in the first place. The fact is that, when many young people enter into the gateway, they are not employable because they do not have the necessary skills. We were attacked for mentioning such things as dress, literacy and the ability to conduct an interview, but those things matter, and without those skills, no one gets past first base. We must address those problems. We do that through the education system, but we are also tackling it directly through the new deal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Inverness, East, Nairn and Lochaber)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the opportunity to discuss the future of the oil fabrication industry in Scotland, with particular reference to Barmac, a large company in my constituency. Many hon. Members will be aware that in December last year, it was announced that more than 3,000 jobs there would go. I am pleased that my hon. Friend the Minister of State will reply to the debate because he has been to Barmac and has a good understanding of the industry. I had a previous adjournment debate in December 1999, and many hon. Members, including my hon. Friends the Members for Aberdeen, Central (Mr. Doran) and for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) were present. I understand that several hon. Members may wish to contribute to the debate, and I know that my neighbour, the hon. Member for Moray (Mrs Ewing) and the right hon.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0270">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
Member for Ross, Skye and Inverness, West (Mr. Kennedy), who cannot be here today, are interested in the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Barmac is an important organisation. It is a combined operation between two large companies, Brown and Root and McDermott's, and it is one of the only surviving companies from the early days of oil exploration. It operates at Ardersier, in my constituency, and in Nigg. In 1998, it had a work force of 6,000. The average work force in 1999 was 3,500. They are skilled, well trained and well managed under the direction of Don Wright, the managing director. They have an interesting and wide range of skills, including engineering and information technology, and the staff includes fitters, welders, riggers, crane operators, scaffolders and painters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The annual wage bill for the directly employed staff is about £85 million, which is important to the highlands and islands economy. It is the largest private employer in the highlands and islands and to the north of Scotland's central belt. It is also the largest steel manufacturer in Scotland. Both yards have survived in an industry that has been bedevilled by peaks and troughs. Barmac is also the largest trainer of skilled labour in Scotland; more than 7,000 people have received training in a variety of skills and about 90 apprentices are currently in training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As many hon. Members will know, this year has been predicted by oil analysts to be the leanest on record for downstream construction work. That has led to immediate job losses at Barmac, which is a tragedy for the work force and for the families who may face a bleak future without a wage or a job. Both yards face the summer with a nearly emply order book. If the worst scenario of closure were to happen, the effect on the highland economy would be disastrous. Its economy is already below the GDP average, which is what initially led to the compnay receiving objective 1 funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the management and the work force have not been waiting for the crisis to happen. The company first implemented cost reduction in the new era—CRINE. It opened the dry dock; unusually for a private sector organisation, it received more than £3 million of objective 1 money for that work. It believed that it had a future in the marketing of floating production vessels, but that has not been achieved. Nevertheless, having a dry dock gives it a great deal of adaptability. It has considered developing markets in Canada, Mexico, Norway and Denmark. It has also considered diversification. It has considered recommissioning redundant rigs, although that market is unlikely to come on stream for at least another five years. Perhaps renewables are a more achievable diversification. Wind and wave power will be an important market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The campaign to generate new work for Barmac is different from the campaign in the early 1990s, which tried to ensure that work on the UK continental shelf went to UK yards thather than the allegedly highly subsidised yards in Spain and Italy. There is now little work in the UK sector. The campaign concentrates instead on convincing oil and gas companies to explore and drill and to produce plans to help the fabrication section.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How much oil is available? Seasoned observers estimate that between 4 billion and 4.5 billion barrels remain to be developed in UK waters. About 1.6 billion barrels could be produced from existing fields after
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
further development. Potential total UK production is large. However, the oil is in small fields and deep water and is geogically challenging, which can make it expensive to extract. The problem—insofar as there is a problem—is that small fields and large companies do not always go well together. It is often said that the strategy of large companies is to go for big fields, such as those in the Gulf of Mexico, but I recently met representatives of large oil companies and was impressed by the commitment of BP, Shell, Texaco and Conoco to the UK continental shelf. Shell has negotiated a deal in Iran and BP is bidding for 50 licences in the same area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are structural problems with the way in which we operate in the North sea. I am not convinced that UK block leasing terms provide an incentive to accelerate development work because ownership periods can vary between 30 and 40 years. Some earlier licences expire in 2010. The Minister may wish to comment on whether changes to the block leasing scheme to encourage companies to develop existing and new fields would make sense in terms of motivating companies to explore and drill. The oil and gas task force that was established by the Government worked on that problem and developed the LIFT policy to enable companies to swap licences. However, I am worried about fallow fields, which are those fields for which companies have been granted licences but which they have decided not to develop. In response to my written question of 21 December, my right hon. Friend, the Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe, said at column 460W of 
	<i>Hansard</i> that 108 oil or gas discoveries have had a licence for more than 10 years but have not been deceloped. That is a large number. I accept that the LIFT policy may help, but I am not convinced that we are fully exploiting the potential of the UK continental shelf.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second practical suggestion is to encourage the establishment of new small oil companies which have fewer overheads and are more manoeuvrable than their larger counterparts. Such companies are marked in the USA where clusters of small companies operate a small number of small fields. They benefit from lower rates of corporation tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third suggestion arises from the fact that the UK has no national champion or flagship operator. Norway has Statoil and France has Elf and Total. Despite the fact that those companies operate in the free market, they are highty supportive of Norweigain and French industry and technology. In the United States, every oil company is a US champion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, I am pleased to have initiated this debate. I have faith in the UK fabrication sector, espeicially the local Barmac yards. They have an excellent and well managed work force with world-class facilities. But the loss of 3,000 jobs will damage the highland economy. Investment decisions by oil companies depend on many factors: the price of oil—Brent oil costs $30 a barrel; accessibility and geology of fields; demand; level of reserves; exploration costs and supply. The key is confidence. No one can force the large companies to invest in the UK sector. The Chancellor of the Exchequer kept his side of the bargain when the fiscal regime remained unchanged. There was an improvement because the implementation of the roll over of capital gains relief helped the industry dramatically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0271">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
It is time for the oil companies either to use their licences or to lose them. We must encourage smaller companies to enter the market and, as I said, we should develop a UK champion. Let us not forget the future for gas. Gas-fired power stations play an important part in the market. The Minister might wish to comment on the current strict consent policy for such installations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are positive future factors. The licensing of the white zone, which the Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe announced in a written answer to me, is very important. The white zone is the deep water between the mainland and the Faroes. The scores for prospects are between 10 million and 30 million barrels in the UK sector. We need sub-sea technology and satellite work, standardisation and simplification. Pilot—the son of the oil and gas industry task force—is addressing the issues. There is an argument about whether the satellite work will provide employment for the fabrication industry; the answer is that it probably will not. We have problems on that front.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must tweak the issue in favour of mature field drilling. The current tax rate is more than 69 per cent.; I have asked to meet the Chancellor to discuss the matter. We must also persuade oil companies to boost their technology developments budgets—they are extremely small, with the honourable exception of those of BP and Shell.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The market is volatile, cyclical and global, dominated by multi-national corporations and the Organization of Petroleum-Exporting Countries. Not even the bhron skear could have predicted the current price of oil. I see a future for the fabrication industry in Scotland and, specifically, in the highlands. The future will be based on diversification, export and niche marketing, especially in pipeline work. The Workers at Barmac and in the rest of the industry in Scotland deserve our support and assistance. Above all, they need the co-operation of the oil and gas companies to bring forward work and to give hope and prospects to the industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scotland Office (Mr. Brian Wilson)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Inverness, East, Nairn and Lochaber (Mr. Stewart) on securing a debate on a subject close to his heart, on which he has done much diligent work. I visited the Ardersier yard recently with him and two Ministers from the Scottish Executive. We had a useful meeting and a realistic presentation from the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What my hon. Friend said in his closing remarks summed the matter up. We want a range of solutions—there will not be a sudden burst of huge platform orders to rescue the yards. Diversification, exporting, niche marketing and the prospect of work—perhaps from decommissioning and certainly, later, from platform building—forms a package that could feasibly give the yards a future. We must all work to put together the components of the package.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully recognise the impact of job losses at Nigg, Ardersier and elsewhere in the industry. The losses are not restricted to Scotland, but many of them have been from there. The figure of 3,000 was a peak figure and, given the industry's cycle, it was always going to diminish when the platforms finished. I share my hon. Friend's view that much can be done together to address the current difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
As my hon. Friend recognised, the background is the dramatic fall in oil prices from more than %20 to %10 a barrel in 1998. In addition, the UK continental shelf was in a mature phase of production, making it almost inevitable that development activity would all but halt. That has left UK yards with no opportunity to bid for new fabrication work and to refill order books. Indeed, only two small to medium-sized projects have progressed since 1998.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government recognise in their general approach to the oil and gas industry the scale of the problem. It is well over a year since the oil and gas industry task force was established to counter the serious impact on the development of the UK oil and gas industry of continuing low international oil prices. The task force includes both public and private-sector representatives working together. I am pleased to have been involved in the joint initiative, undertaken by Government, business and trade unions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the key issues identified for action is improving the competitiveness of the industry. The task force helped in the foundation of LOGIC—leading oil and gas industry competitiveness, a new organisation that will work with companies throughout the industry to stimulate collaboration and to radically improve competitiveness. It will improve UK oil and gas sector performance by an estimated £1 billion over the next three years and export performance by 50 per cent. over the next five years. The Government and five leading trade associations are providing the initial funding for LOGIC. The task force also identified innovation and technology transfer as essential.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs Margaret Ewing 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Moray)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The work being done by the organisation is welcome. Does the Minister agree, however, that one of the reasons why the 108 fields with outstanding licences have not been developed was the review of North sea taxation? Can anything be done in the forthcoming Budget to reassure oil and gas companies of the need to continue development in the North sea?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to the 108 fields in a moment. I referred earlier to the fact that an incoming Government were morally and fiscally obliged to review the existing tax structure in relation to the oil and gas industry. At the end of the day, the Chancellor's decision was not change it except in a positive direction and to grant the rollover, as my hon. Friend the Member for Inverness, East, Nairn and Lochaber mentioned. As has been said, the far more significant factor in the oil companies' decision was the low price of oil. The reality is that there are now far more options at the industry's disposal, as it will affirm. There are places where oil can be extracted more cheaply and in greater quantity, which is part of the decisions that the oil companies make about where to invest, as I am sure that the hon. Lady recognises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The task force recommended the establishment of a strategic group to bring together the training organisations that serve all sectors of the industry. There will be a focus on the new skills needed for the diversified future to which my hon. Friend referred. That will operate by anticipating new ways of working, encouraging the initiation and implementation of change and considering the requirements of new and emerging technologies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend spoke about fallow fields that are not currently being developed—we come, therefore, to the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0272">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
108 fields. As my hon. Friend recognised, a new mechanism known as LIFT was launched last November. It is an internet-based virtual trade fair. If a company does not wish to develop a particular field, the system will enable it to achieve licence trading quickly and at low cost. It will also allow oil companies to maximise the efficiency and performance of their asset portfolios. I hear what my hon. Friend says about the benefits of LIFT and recognition of its potential, but I shall undertake to see whether anything else can be done in relation to the fallow fields.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All of those points about the task force are concrete examples of commitment to helping the oil industry to adapt to the changing market. The task force was renamed PILOT last month to reflect the change in focus from research to delivery. PILOT'S remit is to monitor the success of the activities initiated by the original task force to improve competitiveness and to identify new initiatives that may arise following the conclusion of an oil and gas industry task force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the fabrication sector and to the undeniable reality of its acute problems. Recently surveyed intentions of the oil and gas exploration and production companies operating in the UK to invest in continental shelf oil and gas production in the UK sector show a steep decline from £5.1 billion in 1998 to £3.1 billion in 2000. The sum is still substantial, although, unfortunately, not all of it is for new development projects, which would require the fabrication of a number of the large fixed reduction platforms that have been the mainstay of the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past, demand was for the traditional type of platform, which has been required since the earliest days of North sea production. More recently, floating production systems and floating, production, storage and offloading vessels—FPSOs—have been in demand. That has resulted in a supply industry, consisting of about 10 companies, operating in a dozen yards throughout the United Kingdom; at their peak, they had the capacity to employ nearly 20,000 people. Of those yards, five are in Scotland and at their peak they employed about 12,000 people; they now employ fewer than 4,000. As Barmac's order book runs out, the number of employees may continue to reduce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although new orders have not been coming forward, I am heartened that those companies are committed to keeping the yards open on a care and maintenance basis; they will still be equipped to pick up new business as and when it appears. That is obviously important for Barmac. The firm is fighting hard for that work, so it might never come to care and maintenance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister, like me, would welcome the fact that the welding school has been maintained at Barmac. That training is significant for the young people in the area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree. I was extremely impressed and encouraged by Barmac's approach. It is important that the message goes out that no one is walking away from the problem. It is not a terminal crisis in the industry; the industry has suffered peaks and troughs before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Significant factors are at work, notably the investment decisions of the oil companies and the stage production on the UK continental shelf. All companies know of the changes that are taking place, and they are seeking to adapt to them. I am not aware of a political argument; it is a case of us doing together what we can to put
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
additional and diversified work into those yards to give them a future—albeit on a different basis. I am certainly heartened that those companies have committed themselves to keeping the yards open.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are keen to ensure that the oil companies continue to bring forward business, and we shall continue to press companies to move projects forward. I was delighted to hear last month that my right hon. Friend the Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe had approved three new field developments in the central North sea. Those will provide valuable opportunities for UK suppliers such as Kvaerner Oil and Gas, which has won the contract to construct the Jade jacket at its Methil site.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the most high profile projects is Clair, a large potential platform development west of Shetland. Again, I emphasise that orders are still to be had. The geology of Clair is extremely complex, and much work still needs to be done to deliver an economically robust development. BP Amoco is actively working on that project. A recent simplification of the Clair partnership, together with an agreed work programme for 2000, has added fresh momentum. Even so, the earliest likely sanction date for Clair is mid-2001. That reinforces the impression of a serious gap in the market conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the changed circumstances at the beginning of a new decade, the implications for companies and employees in the fabrication industry are extremely serious. With a maturing UK continental shelf, the days of large fabrication are at an end for the time being, and future domestic requirements will be for smaller platforms and facility work associated with the sub-sea developments of floating systems. As we heard with Barmac, there is a lot of that work about. It is a moot point whether much of it is suitable for the fabrication yards, but other companies in the industry, especially in Aberdeen, will benefit substantially from the demand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are encouraging fabrication companies in two general ways. I have been preaching hard that they must first look for work overseas. About 30 per cent. of output in 1998 was for export markets. To be internationally competitive, companies must look also to the potential global market for FTSOs. During the next five years, as many as 100 fields in the world may be be able to use FTSOs. Those fields include the Gulf of Mexico, offshore Brazil, west Africa, especially Angola and Nigeria, Norway, Canada, Australia and south-east Asia.

The Government are working hard to promote exports by opening doors for British companies overseas. Last week, I undertook a four-nation tour of the far east and I heard most about the oil and gas sector. Massive projects may be available, and if British companies can win the lead contracts, there is every prospect of much of that work coming back to UK yards.

Without rancour, I inform the hon. Member for Moray that I was attacked locally by her party for making that trip and especially for going to Vietnam. I suspect that some of its members still believe that anyone travelling to Vietnam seeks only to chant ho, ho, Ho Chi-Minh. In fact, I was considering a billion pound investment in oil and gas. I praise Scottish Enterprise in relation to Vietnam. It has had the foresight to set up a project there to ensure that the

	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
maximum number of Scottish companies are well placed to take advantage of the opportunities that will arise there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are working hard to help export promotion and it is essential that we do everything possible to maximise such opportunities. That is vital for Scottish companies right down the chain and for employment, especially if export orders are to play a full part in compensating for the down-turn of activity in the North sea. The work exists worldwide, but we must be sure that we are placed to get our fair share of it.

The UK oil fabrication industry is renowned worldwide for its skills, knowledge and expertise. It is clear, that to maintain our competitive edge, we need to adapt to some markets. For example, LOGIC conducted a study comparing the cost of topside process facilities in the UK sector with those designed for the Gulf of Mexico. The study revealed three principal differences between the sectors. It showed fundamental dissimilarities such as the different cost premium for responding to the harsher, colder weather conditions in the UK, the must larger market in the USA and a different approach to design meaning that the Gulf of Mexico has simpler and more standardised designs. The study clearly identifies the changes needed in the UK supply insutry to deliver UK offshore facilities at United States prices.

I mentioned the Gulf of Mexico, so I should inform the Committee that I look forward to welcoming next month a delegation from Cuba, which is now developing the Cuban sector of the Gulf of Mexico. It is coming to Edinburgh and Aberdeen and will be led by the Cuban Minister for basic industries, a senior figure in the Cuban Government. Whenever there are opportunities, we must talk to Governments and companies, introduce them to Scottish interests and ensure that we obtain the maximum possible proportion of export work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fabrication companies must continue to strive to increase their competitiveness in every sense in the home market. For example, they must offer appropriate and innovative solutions to ensure that fixed platforms are cost effective even for the smallest UK fields. Best estimates show that considerable oil reserves remain to be exploited, although it may well be that none of them are on the scale previously found. Most undeveloped oil discoveries contain reserves of less than 20 million barrels of oil equivalent each. There is considerable remaining potential in the relatively unexplored west of Shetland area and especially in the white zone, which is closer to the producing Foinaven
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
and Schiehallion oil fields. My hon. Friend the Member for Inverness, East, Nairn and Lochaber referred to the good news that he had received on that front.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidentally, we must be wary that the west of Shetland and west of Hebrides potential is not undermined by the excessive interest of environmental organisations. We are very environmentally aware and we have no intention of threatening St. Kilda, the Minch or anywhere else. However, if we reach a stage at which nothing can be done off the west coast because of the designation of St. Kilda, it will be extremely bad news for the industry. I hope that there will be some political unanimity on the matter and that nobody will jump too rapidly on to passing bandwagons and attack the Government for their intention or on what they are doing to protect St. Kilda but also the economic potential of development west of Hebrides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Short and long-term issues must be resolved for the oil fabrication industry. There is a pressing need to identify alternative employment for workers in the affected companies during the present downturn in orders. In the case of Barmac, an oil industry response team has been set up, comprising Highlands and Islands Enterprise, the Highland regional council, the Employment Service and their partners. The team has developed a range of initiatives aimed at placing redundant workers in new jobs and assisting with skills development. The tradition of the industry is that people are prepared to travel, so if we can find the opportunities, it is likely that many will do so. Of course, others will not travel, perhaps because of family responsibilities. That, too, must be part of our response. In the long term, it is important to identify alternative types of work for fabrication companies, and we all recognise that the management of Barmac has been energetic in the pursuit of such alternatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In summary, I remind the Committee that there is no easy or single answer to what is a very big problem. An awful lot of jobs depend on the industry and a great many skills developed over the years can be adapted to other opportunities in the home market and to international opportunities. I hope that as a result of my remarks, no doubt is left in anyone's mind that everyone involved in Government and in the UK oil production industry are encouraging the fabricators—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
