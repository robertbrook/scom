	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the first Amendment I would remind the Committee that there is a Financial Resolution in connection with the Bill. I do not propose to direct that it should be read, but if any member of the Committee desires to see it he will find copies of it on the Table. I should also like to call attention to the fact that adequate notice should be given of all Amendments. Starred Amendments are often very unfair to other Members of the Committee because insufficient time is given for consideration, and I do not, as a general rule, intend to call manuscript Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like, Mr. Blackburn, to raise a point on the first Amendment which you have just said is not selected. I should welcome your guidance. This Amendment refers to one of the most important provisions to the Bill, namely, the differential contribution between those in non-partici-

pating employment and those who join the new scheme. I wonder whether it is permissible for me to ask when and where this important question may be the subject of an Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I bear in mind that there is a reference to this in the opening lines of Clause 7, and it may be that any Amendment that I wish to move on this matter would be more appropriate there; but if that were so, I would hope not to be handicapped in moving it by the existence in Clause 1 of the words that my first Amendment proposes to delete.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 1, line 13, to leave out from the beginning to the end of line 10 on page 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be convenient if I first told the Committee what our aim is in this Amendment. The effect of the Amendment would be to substitute a uniform flat rate system of contribution, with neither ceiling nor floor, and apply it not only to pensions but to all social service contributions and benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are taking the present Government scheme, which is a mongrel combination of the flat rate system and the graded system, and seeking to knock out the flat rate element altogether. That is the effect of the five Amendments which we are introducing. We delete the provision introducing any reference to the flat rate and at the end we leave the figure of 4¼ per cent. and make that the substantial proposal. I would point out that that would mean that no Schedule would be required, and we assume that we should have to delete the Schedule as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are proposing on this Amendment to discuss the whole basic principle of the flat rate as against graded contributions. I should like to make two comments before I come to my main argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, we would have infinitely preferred in our own proposal to limit graded contributions solely to old age pensions. We found it impossible in the terms of this Bill to re-write it to suit us, and we had to deal with the Bill as it is and make a practicable Amendment. If we want
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0038">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
to have universal graded contributions in the Bill we cannot limit them to old age pensions, and they have to be extended to sickness and unemployment benefit. Of course this is not Labour Party policy, and we are putting it forward today because we wish to discuss in principle the whole issue of the graded contribution as against the fiat rate contribution. Much the same applies to our decision to leave the 4¼ per cent. as the amount, of course. We realise that if we were to switch to graded contributions for all social services we should not be able to get the kind of rate of benefit which we should like to see for old age pensions from a 4¼ per cent. contribution spread over all the other services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we thought it wise to leave this figure untouched and we have made calculations which indicate that even if we were calculating for the whole of our social security benefits, graded contributions levied on all incomes from top to bottom, without ceiling or floor, would be completely adequate to cover the benefits and give the Minister an amount of money above what he would get from the basic flat rate plus the grading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now come to the principle which we are discussing, namely the question of the flat rate. I think that the Committee will have Jess disagreement about the principle than it would have had two years ago. In the simple and admirable explanation of the Government scheme published by the Conservative Party there is a very interesting section on page 5 in answer to the question:
	<br><blockquote><p>"How will the scheme help those workers not covered by occupational schemes … ? "</p></blockquote>
The answer is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The new scheme makes it possible for these workers to start earning a pension more in line with their earnings before retirement."</p></blockquote>
There is then this striking sentence:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Nothing like that is possible with a flat rate scheme under which nobody can pay more (or receive more) than the lower paid workers can afford."</p></blockquote>
I think that we shall also get agreement from the other side of the Committee that what is wrong with the flat rate scheme is that it makes it impossible ever to reach an adequate level of pension. It is pegged to what the lowest paid worker can afford. So any flat rate scheme cannot be far above the poverty line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
It is worth while asking why it was that when the Beveridge scheme and the whole of our social security arrangements were talked about in 1944 the flat rate was accepted to easily. I think it was because we were looking back to the poverty and mass unemployment of the thirties, and we had our sights fixed very low. Everyone felt that it would be a saving miracle to have even a little for everybody—fair shares in adversity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is, I think, a very encouraging factor that as the result of the growing prosperity since the war we have been able to raise our sights and we now realise that in dealing with old-age pensions, what we require is a contribution rate and benefit rate linked to wages. This, I think, is essential if we are to achieve in old-age pensions what we want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What do we mean by a subsistence old-age pension? Subsistence cannot be defined as exactly the same in £ s. d. for everyone. What we mean by subsistence is the smallest possible decline in our purchasing power when we retire from work; not the catastrophic fall in the standard of living which must come if all that we have is a flat rate pension. Roughly there is a 75 per cent. fall in the standard of living of the average worker if that is all he gets. I think that there is considerable common ground on both sides of the Committee on the principle that pensions must be wage and salary related.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What puzzles me is how the Minister can defend introducing the principle of graded contributions and graded benefits and then limit it at the bottom and at the top, cutting it off so that it applies only to a wage and salary band from £9 to £15 a week. What is the defence for a Bill, which goes so far as to admit the principle of grading and then applies it in this extraordinary way?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The result, in our view, of what the Government are doing is that the new graded pension will not be available where it is most needed. We have no doubt whatever—I think that there is no disagreement in the Committee on this—that, by and large, the better-off members of the community have for a long time looked after their old age with considerable skill, whether they do it individually by insurance policies or collectively by superannuation or top hat policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0039">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
If we look at the spread of the occupational pension scheme, we find that it is first the executives in a firm who get it and then it spreads to the industrial workers. The problem of the better-off was in the process of being solved by private occupational pension schemes. The gap arises in that most of the lower paid workers have no possibility or prospect of occupational pension schemes from private sources. We are looking forward to some growth of occupational schemes in the next ten years but it is unlikely that more than half of the employed workers will be in occupational schemes at the end of ten years. Even then, all the lowest paid workers will be left out. If nearly all the lowest paid workers are left out of occupational pension schemes on the private side, how can the Government defend leaving out everyone under £9 a week from the benefits of the new State graded pension scheme?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the essence of the Government's plan, to leave the flat rate pension and contributions for everyone under £9 a week. That excludes not only nearly all women workers but also many agricultural workers. The agricultural worker is an example of someone who needs Government help, yet the agricultural worker, unless he is lucky and earns more than £9 a week, is excluded from this scheme altogether. He merely pays a flat rate contribution for a flat rate benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am discussing the principle hereof excluding the lowest paid worker. The Government scheme leaves out the people who most need Government support and assistance in superannuation. This is why we feel that this Bill will do so little to bridge the gap, the gap of the two nations in old age, the gap between those with occupational schemes in addition to national insurance pensions and those without. That gap is widening. I do not see how the Government scheme, even if the contributions were better, would very much help us to narrow that gap when millions of workers are excluded from it because they do not earn more than £9 a week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us turn from the bottom to the top of the Government plan. Here is my second question. We have not had an adequate explanation from the Minister as to why it is that wages and salaries
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
above the £15 band are excluded from contribution. Here I should like to quote the figures which we worked out for ourselves in a very rough and ready way as to what would be the effect of bringing in these people. Our Amendment would bring them all in. If we introduce an Amendment under which everyone pays 4¼ per cent. we can see the difference between the Goverment's pension scheme on the basis of a flat rate contribution plus grading from £9 to £15 and a simple graded scheme on the basis of 4¼ per cent. from everyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have worked out figures very roughly. I hesitate to put them before the Minister as I know he is sceptical about figures, and I hope that if they are inaccurate he will correct them for us. We have put the Government scheme and ours side by side. Dealing first of all with self-employed persons, and taking 1961, if we are right the Government scheme will be collecting £402 million while under our scheme the Government would collect from the employers £500 million; and whereas the insured persons would pay £362 million under the Government scheme, they would pay £475 million under our scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then we have made calculations for the self-employed, on the assumption that they are brought in, for later we are going to move a new Clause in which we shall propose the inclusion of self-employed persons. If those are included, under our scheme the amount brought in will be £115 million in contributions whereas the Government scheme produces only £32 million where there is the flat rate benefit. In 1961 the total collected under our scheme would be £1,096 million and under the Government scheme £802 million. In 1971 our scheme would produce £1,316 million while the Government scheme would produce £1,015 million; and in 1981 our total would be £1,617 against £1,219 under the Government scheme. We have made similar calculations for employers and employed and for self-employed persons for those various dates and we should like to put those on record and to ask that the figures shall be looked at later to see whether we are correct. We cannot expect an answer today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that if these figures are approximately accurate they indicate
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0040">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
the astonishing increase in income achieved by including in the scheme incomes above £15 per week. Once those incomes are included we get that big difference. We make our top limit £2,000—four times the average national wage, If we add that to the Government income we really begin to collect an amount which enables us to pay adequate benefit. What interests us most of all is to elicit from Her Majesty's Government why people with £16, £17 and £18 and up to £47 per week are excluded from their scheme. Is there an explanation of that in the Conservative Party's own pamphlet? Here is the answer given to the general public on page 7 of that pamphlet:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Why does the graduated contribution not extend to earnings above £15 a week?"</p></blockquote>
The reply given was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The object of the new scheme is … to make better provision for old age in the light of our rising national prosperity. But it would not be right for a State scheme to make people contribute more for their old age than is reasonably necessary. For that would amount to dictating to a person how to spend his money during his working life. Such State dictation would be rightly resented and would undermine people's sense of responsibility for their own affairs. A person may wish to make private provision for his own old age."</p></blockquote>
The more I look at that answer the more curious it is because there is no doubt that dictation is imposed upon those with earnings from £9 to £15 per week and, as we shall show, the amount levied by the State on the £9 per week person is an outrage in view of the benefit he gets. Yet it is a compulsory levy. According to Conservative philosophy, that is no infringement of liberty. Yet, suddenly, above £15 per week this levy becomes an outrage on human liberty. That is so completely baffling to us and we should like to ask the right hon. Gentleman what happens at the level of £16 per week to make compulsory contributions an infringement of liberty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I notice that private occupational schemes do not feel it a great infringement of liberty to inflict contributions on people earning over £15 per week. On the contrary, it is the higher-paid people on whom there is imposed sometimes a 5 per cent. and sometimes a 10 per cent. levy on income, as a condition of service. That is regarded as excellent, healthy, and non-inflationary. It is the perfect thing we all desire—when it is done by I.C.I.; but when it is done by
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
the Government we are told that it is an infringement of liberty. We do not understand why a national scheme of this kind should be considered such an infringement when a scheme, possibly more ambitious, levied on upper ranges of income is regarded as in conformity with freedom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our view the State should not do the total saving for old age, and I do not think that the half pay for the average worker which we want is by any means all which some would desire. If one could get to two-thirds by private savings, so much the better. We are not pretending that the State ought to do everything, but we are saying that the State should provide a firm foundation; and the kind of foundation at which we aim is universal half-pay on retirement. That, roughly speaking, is the sort of thing which should be done through a State superannuation scheme, if it is not already provided by a private scheme. If that is done, those at the bottom can be helped by making the top level pay its share; for it is quite clear to me that the real reason for the unsatisfactory Government benefit rates is the exclusion of those with wages and salaries above £15 per week. By excluding those people Her Majesty's Government have made it impossible to provide any adequate rate of benefit. It is simply a method of making the State scheme an inadequate, second-rate scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This combination of flat rate plus a little grading proposed by Her Majesty's Government seems to get the worst of every possible world. It does not keep those who most need help. It does not make those who are well off pay then-fair share. It provides benefit which has no relation to contribution, even on the middle ranges. But it transfers the burden of paying the existing flat rate old-age pensions on to the shoulders of the middle range, those with salaries of from £9 to £15 per week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I could sum up this discussion of the principle—and on this Amendment we are dealing chiefly with principle and not details—it seems to me that Her Majesty's Government and ourselves differ on two main issues. We assert that a scheme of this kind should be universal and should bring in everybody. If we are to have grading, then everybody should
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0041">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
be graded and all incomes from the bottom to the top should be graded. That is my first point—how many shall be brought in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Spencer Summers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman thinks everybody should be brought in from the bottom to the top, but he said he would stop at £2,000 a year.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Crossman</div> <!-- member -->

Up to £15 it is a selective scheme. The hon.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Crossman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept your ruling, Mr. Blackburn, that I should not be lured aside by hon. Members opposite. Our differences are, first, on the degree of inclusiveness: we think the scheme should be inclusive up to the level of £47 to £50 from the lowest earnings. Secondly, we believe that the amount of security for old age to be provided should be something like half-pay on retirement, whereas
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
the whole of the Government scheme with its rate of contribution does not attempt to achieve anything of that kind and leaves most of the lower wage earners in a position of having to have recourse to national assistance if there is no other form of support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us be clear on where this scheme is leading us. Her Majesty's Government claim that this is a great reform. Yet under this " great reform " 1 million people will have still to apply for national assistance because of inadequate pensions. We say that any so-called " reform " of pensions which leaves 1 million people going to national assistance is an outrage. Any real reform must start at the bottom and deal with those people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Later we shall be bringing forward Amendments to try to write into this Bill improvements of the existing pension rates because we believe that any such Bill as this ought to raise the level of existing pensions and provide further guarantee against inflation. We would ask the right hon. Gentleman whether he could not reflect on the inadequacies of his graded pensions. Would he not be prepared to bring the grading up to a reasonable level where we can bring m the better-off sections of the community to pay their share? 
	<i>The Economist</i> has frankly admitted that the point is to save money. But that should not be the whole point. The point of reforming pensions is to ensure that where there is destitution amongst old people at least we begin to remove it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not easy, but over ten or twelve years we should redistribute the wealth of the community in such a way as to remove this terrible fact of 1 million old people going to national assistance. Surely Her Majesty's Government must admit that a pension scheme which leaves that, a system whereby those earning from £9 to £15 a week pay extra graded contributions and get a miserable pittance back while the bottom and the top are excluded, is a scheme unworthy of consideration. I suggest that this Amendment makes the beginning of a serious scheme and it is for that reason that I put it forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

That is the first difficulty.

The third difficulty of principle is that the contribution is made partly by way of Exchequer grant and partly by way of tax. It is very difficult to base that system upon any clear principle. The Minister would be much more frank if he were to say, " In this country we like compromises. This is a compromise. It is not based on any clear principle. It could be a step towards the adoption of the Labour Party's plan. It will certainly make it easier for them, if they ever have an opportunity, to carry out their plan." That would be understandable, but I find it difficult to justify the Government proposals on any clear ground of principle.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: —concerns the £12 to £15 a week wage earner. I can see some force in the criticism that people in that category are bearing a higher proportion of the burden in comparison with their income. It seems that such a person will have to bear a disproportionate burden in comparison, for example, with the wage earner in the £15 to £20 category. That is not only my opinion. The 
	<i>Manchester Guardian</i> of 9th January contained an article which said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government has also erred in retaining the upper limit of graduation at £15 a week; this means not only that pensions must fail to keep pace with rising incomes but also that an unfair share of the cost of paying basic pensions will be borne by those earning between £9 and 15 a week."</p></blockquote>
I sum up by saying that I have some fundamental objections to the scheme, which I endeavoured to make clear in the Second Reading debate. If we are going to pass the Bill we should have a little more enlightenment from the Minister, who should tell us why he is retaining the limit of £15. Is he satisfied that the wage earner in the £9 to £15 bracket will not have to bear an unfair burden of the payments necessary to finance the scheme?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend's case, and as he may still be thinking about what he should say I can raise one or two points in support of my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment deals with contributions. Our purpose is to wipe out the combined flat rate and graduated contribution and have a purely graduated one. We are now dealing with principles which will apply throughout the Bill. The Beveridge Report set out three guiding principles which should be applied in any
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0043">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
form of social security. The first was that it should not be restricted by the consideration of sectional interests; the second was that social insurance should be treated as only a part of a comprehensive policy; and the third was that social security must be achieved by cooperation between the State and the individual. Those three principles were intended to guide us in our approach to social insurance. The Bill, especially in regard to what it is doing about flat rate and graded contribution, is a classic example of the alteration of those principles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Beveridge Report also laid down six fundamental principles. When it was issued we had a flat rate contribution. There was a good deal of discussion about that, and, if my memory serves me correctly, the Report said that that should be continued, because it was the British way of life. The Committee had considered the New Zealand scheme and other schemes, but because of considerations of history, and because the Committee felt it to be fair, it said that the flat rate system of social insurance should continue because it was particularly applicable to British thinking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friend that if we are to have a future increase in social security and benefits some departure from the flat rate system must be made. Even when the National Insurance Act was introduced and we had a contribution of 4s. 7d. from the employee, I had a feeling that if we were going to make a great advance in social benefits we would have to depart from the flat rate system from then onwards. But that system has been continued up to the introduction of this Bill. The Committee also put forward other considerations, such as the unification of administration. That will be altered by the Bill. It also mentioned the adequacy of benefit, which we shall come to in later Clauses, and there was the question of comprehensiveness. We are departing from the conception of social insurance which we started with in the Beveridge Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another very important phrase at the beginning of the Report was to the effect that these were revolutionary changes, and that this was no time for patching. We are making a revolutionary change
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
in principle under the Bill. We are departing from the flat rate contribution and going on to a graded contribution. Therefore, I agree with what the Beveridge Committee said; this is no time for patching. This change will involve more than a new conception of contributions. I was associated with the administrative problems of insurance for some time, and I realised that, no matter what we did, administrative problems would always occur with a graduated contribution, first, with regard to the collection of the contributions, and, secondly, with their recording. I realise that it would no longer be a simple operation of affixing stamps, but that, try as the Department might, there were bound to be many difficult operations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we discuss the Question, " That the Clause stand part of the Bill," I hope to ask how this will be done, and What the Government have in mind. In the meantime, however, we are dealing with the change of principle, and my hon. Friend is right in saying that since we are doing this we must stop patching and make a great advance. The Amendment takes away the minimum and upper limits and brings everybody in. That restores the comprehensiveness of the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have issued a false prospectus in this regard, and I have no doubt that my hon. Friends will deal with its details. To indicate that a man earning £15 or more a week will obtain a pension of 91s. if he is single and 121s. if he is married is quite wrong. How can anyone ever reach such a pension? Under the system which is being put forward it will be quite impossible, with this type of contribution, for more than a very few people to reach this pension. Under the present scheme, which is based upon 50 contributions a year, graded over the lifetime of insurance to enable a person to receive his maximum benefit, there are two spare contributions in each year, which enable a person to have a floating contribution which he can use to make up any leeway. There is also an opportunity at the end of each year for a man to pay the arrears of contributions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the scheme laid down in the Bill, however, in order to get the maximum a man must be earning an average wage of between £9 and £15 a week from the age of 18 until he retires. Can anyone conceive of that being done?
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0044">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
Only in a few cases will it be possible. Therefore this is a false prospectus. Our Amendment proposes that the ceiling should be raised from £15, and that a man should be given an opportunity in later life, when his earnings are greater, to earn the improved pension.

	<div class='member'>Sir S. Summers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has been fairly clear from the speech of the hon. Gentleman the Member for Dunbartonshire, West (Mr. Steele) that the object of these Amendments is to transform the whole character of this Bill from one in which the view of the Government prevails to that which the Opposition thought should prevail by the publications they have made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. G. W. Reynolds</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is really not quite right or fair. It is the difference between what the Government are proposing and the way in which it could be improved to bring it slightly closer to what the Labour Party wants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With regard to this Amendment, it is only in the matter of contributions we are discussing either scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lawson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Labour Party's own scheme for this is a flat rate contribution. We are speaking contrariwise to our own scheme as well as the Government's.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir S. Summers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to take up time on this point. Hon. Members opposite are getting as near to their scheme as the rules of order permit. I will not debate the wisdom or otherwise of accepting that advice; a great deal has been said on the subject on Second Reading and elsewhere. I will confine my remarks to one only of the Amendments we are discussing—if the others were rejected, it could be considered in isolation—which deals with the age at which the Government scheme is to start. It is the Amendment in page 2, line 14, leave out " eighteen " and insert " sixteen ".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister is considering that I hope he will bear in mind there is a considerable school of thought which
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
believes the scheme as drawn up in the Bill should start at twenty-one and not eighteen. I do not subscribe to that view, but I think it is only right that the existence of that school of thought should be made known. The case for starting the scheme at twenty-one instead of eighteen is based partly on the fact that under that age it is very frequent for young people to transfer employment from one firm to another, which will affect the question of contracting out. Secondly, it is very common in occupational schemes for a period of apprenticeship to be required before young people are regarded as part and parcel of the occupational scheme, and that all tends in the direction of not starting the scheme for individual people too soon after they have left school and gone into industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. J. T. Price</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The argument has substance and validity so far as privately administered occupational schemes are concerned. In other words, the age might quite sensibly be fixed at eighteen to ensure that people not yet settled in that employment are likely to remain there. But when we are dealing with national insurance we are dealing with universality. Looking at this nationally, the man who goes as a worker at sixteen has to pay his national insurance contributions whether he is sixteen or eighteen. Therefore, it is not a fair argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir S. Summers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point I am trying to make is that the starting date of this scheme will affect those occupational schemes which have contracted out. The later the scheme is started the more will be the loss to the firm. It will undoubtedly cost a considerable amount where the beginning age is raised to twenty-one. That is one of the main reasons why I do not support that change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In considering the merits of the Amendment to reduce the age from eighteen to sixteen, it is only right to take into account the school of thought which considers that eighteen is on the low side. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will not only reject the broad trend of the Amendments we are discussing, but will reject the arguments in favour of reducing the age below eighteen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Crossman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not quite clear what the great disadvantage is. If it is agreed we are going to have transferability extended, there will be as much
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0045">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
gain as loss; the gains cancel out the losses. I am not sure whether it is felt that another two years of acquiring pension rights are a great disadvantage. If the age is taken down to sixteen, all boys and girls start acquiring pension rights from the moment they enter industry. The earlier they start the better; the great trouble is we all start too late. It seems advantageous at the age when they have plenty of money that some of it should be set aside for the sake of their pension. Sixteen seems to be socially desirable in every way. The hon. Gentleman seems to say it will be disadvantageous for the firm because it disturbs the fund of the firm by having movement in it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir S. Summers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I mentioned the loss to the fund in raising the age I was, of course, thinking of the national fund. The disadvantage of bringing the age down to sixteen is that the majority of schemes which are likely to pass the test and become eligible for contracting out frequently require two years' employment in a firm to make certain the employee is a stayer to whom the firm's contribution may reasonably be given, and that is the justification for a period before he actually joins the scheme. If he is started at sixteen, and it is made more difficult for those firms whose occupational schemes exist to contract out, they will be less willing to pay their share of the bargain into a fund if they have little confidence that the individual is likely to remain with them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Crossman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is quite an important point, but if one individual is lost another will be gained from another firm. I think this is a fictitious objection to the movement of people. Anyone who goes to a firm brings with him pension rights and is easier to fit into a scheme. Transferability is of great assistance in the recruitment of labour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir S. Summers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are here dealing with a scheme in which contributions for increased earnings depend on a rate of £9. It is unlikely that there will be many below the age of eighteen whose graduated contributions would make a very great difference. It is the administrative side rather than the financial side which makes me take exception to the proposal to reduce the age.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lawson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The short answer to the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Sir S. Summers) is that we are dealing with an Amendment or group of Amendments which will wipe out flat rate contributions. The youngster at sixteen pays a flat rate contribution. We are dealing with the younster at sixteen on the same basis as the other person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In supporting these Amendments. I would make three points. It seems to me that our Amendments will make for easier administration in the whole of the scheme. Our Amendments will be much more easily adopted as the basis of the Bill, and would make for a much more equitable insurance system than the one which is made out in the Bill before us. Thirdly, there can be no doubt that the Government scheme is a transitory scheme, and in a few years' time when, for example, inflation continues or wages continue to rise, the £15 will become the flat rate and there will be a repetition of the kind of thing we have today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme as laid down by the Government could not be described as permanent. It is a patchwork affair to overcome certain difficulties. Our Amendments would make for permanency. On the question of easier administration, if the Amendments were adopted it would mean the end of the stamp system. There would be a diversity of payment on the basis of each pound. On the assumption that it would be a percentage of earnings, there would be collected in much the same way as pay-as-you-earn a sum corresponding to 4¼ per cent. of each person's earnings. I cannot but think this would make for much greater simplicity in administration than the operation of a dual system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Bill goes 'through as drafted by the Government there will be a flat rate stamp on the card every week and a graded payment for a sufficient number of people to make it imperative for large numbers of employers to operate a double payment and double calculating system. The scheme we propose has the merit of being a single calculating system. I am reminded of what was said by the British Employers' Confederation when it spoke of the need for greater simplicity in administration. We realise if we embark on any kind of system which will relate payments of contributions to earnings there must be calculation, but if we can
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0046">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
have the single system, excluding the flat rate stamp system, it must surely make for ease of administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then there is the question of equity. The Government system is inequitable to quite a different selection of people; not merely to those earning between £12 and £15 a week—although it is inequitable enough to them—but to others. The £9 a week man who is in the scheme, though paying no graded contribution, will pay—taking into account his employer's contribution as well—8½ per cent. of his earnings, but the £6-a-week man's total contribution will be getting on for 13 per cent. of his earnings——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir S. Summers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder if the hon. Gentleman will tell us what kind of occupation the £6-a-week man follows?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lawson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suggest that the hon. Member goes round the country and sees for himself what payments are being made at present. In any case, if there is none earning £6, why is the £6 earning put in the Bill? Presumably, the Government, in putting in that figure, thought that some were affected by it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I was saying, the contribution of the £6-a-week man and his employer will be getting on for 13 per cent. of his income. The man earning £7 a week will pay a percentage substantially above that of the man earning £9, and the £8-a-week man's percentage will be substantially higher than that suggested here. Therefore, those earning less than £9 a week are already being charged more than 8½ per cent. of their income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has made a very great " to do " about the fact that the Bill will reduce the minimum payment, the flat-rate payment, of the lower-paid man; that that man will be paying less than he pays on the existing basis. If our Amendments were adopted by the Committee, there would be a more substantial reduction for the lower-paid man.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a rough calculation, 4¼ per cent. represents 10d. in the £, or a fraction over. On that basis, I would say that the £6-a-week man would be paying about 5s. 1d. a week, plus his employer's 5s. 1d. Under our scheme, the man who is at present paying 8s. 4d. a week, would be paying 5s. 1d. The man on £7 a week Would pay, as his own contribution, 5s, 11d. as against 8s. 4d. In the same
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
way, the man on £8 a week would pay 6s. 9d. instead of 8s. 4d. In each case, both employee and employer pay equal amounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the basis of this graded payment, the lower-paid worker would receive substantially greater benefits than he would as a result of this scheme about which the Government have made so much fuss. The Government have spoken largely about enabling the lower-paid worker to get as much as before, for less.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This smaller payment would apply, on the graded basis, right up to the £15 a week man, because the Amendments suggest that the employee should pay 4¼ per cent. and so should the employer, making 8½ per cent. in all. On our basis, the man on £9 a week would pay, not 8s. 4d. but 7s. 8d.; the £10-a-week man, instead of paying 9s. 2d.—including 10d. for graded contribution—would pay about 8s. 6d.; at £11 a week, he would pay 9s. 4d. instead of 10s.; at £12, 10s. 2d. instead of 10s. 10d.; at £13, 11s. 1d. instead of 11s. 9d.; at £14, 11s. 11d. instead of 12s. 7d., and at £15, 12s. 9d. instead of 13s. 5d.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those figures are only a copper, or a fraction of a copper, out, but this is related to the gross figures of total income already advanced by my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, East (Mr. Crossman), showing that the contributor would have a larger total income. Here we have a system that enables the lower-paid worker to pay less than he pays now—and substantially less, in some cases. Therefore, on the basis of giving the fairest possible deal to the lower-paid worker, there can be no answer to the scheme suggested by my hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already, in part, dealt with the third point. Surely no hon. Member opposite will argue that there is anything in the way of permanency about the Government scheme. It has the primary purpose of enabling the future burden of insurance to be shifted from the shoulders of the taxpayers to those of the lower-paid workers—and here I refer to earnings all the way up to £15. That is its purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is supposed to be a graded scheme, but it will continue to be such only so long as wages remain as they are now, and only so long as inflation does not continue. Any shift—and it does not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0047">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
need any great shift—in the level of wages—and we must remember that inflation has been with us throughout the century—any continuance of a pressure that has gone on over the years, will mean that, in a short time, we shall once again be on a flat rate basis of contribution——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir S. Summers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most interested in that comment, because it is my intention to move a new Clause designed to prevent what the hon. Member suggests. I therefore look forward to his support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lawson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The scheme presented to us now is not the Labour Party's system. Nevertheless, it is a system that has within it all the features of permanency; a system which, if we continue with inflationary trends—which we hope will not be the case, but which is likely—will adjust itself automatically. It is a system that presents great elasticity. It may be discovered that the man earning £2,000 a year will be delighted to help his poorer colleagues, and be quite happy to pay, not just 4¼ per cent. of his income, but perhaps even as much as 5 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government might be generous enough to bring the 8½ per cent. up to 10 per cent. In fact, we might have in this the makings of a really worth-while system—perhaps even as good as the Labour Party's original system. I hope that the Minister will address himself to these points, and tell us why he cannot accept what to us seems to be obvious.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before calling the next speaker, I would remind the hon. Member for Stockport, South (Mr. H. Steward), that in the event of a Division he is not within the Committee. He can remain where he is if he wishes. I realise the shortage of accommodation. It is difficult to find seats for everyone. As a matter of fact, when I found that the Committee had to meet in Room 11, I immediately saw the Serjeant-at-Arms and laid claim to one of the larger rooms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Steward</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance (Miss Edith Pitt)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to what has so far been said, but I must confess that I am still a little puzzled as to the object of these Amendments. I do not say that in any way critically. Those of us who have taken an interest in national insurance in years gone by have voiced the opinion that it is a very difficult and technical subject. Having myself mastered a Bill that is no less technical, I am not surprised that hon. Members opposite find it difficult to say precisely what the Amendments would achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment in page 1, line 13, on which this debate has taken place, seeks to abolish the minimum contribution, except presumably for those contracted-out. It was probably not intended, but I am advised that the technical result of its acceptance would be that the present contribution would continue. Far from abolishing any flat-rate contribution, the effect would be that the present rates would continue—that is, the 18s. 2d. for the employed man—against the Government's present proposal of 15s. 4d. as the new minimum rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand, of course, that the effect which the Amendment seeks to obtain is to knock out the flat-rate altogether—as the hon. Member for Motherwell (Mr. Lawson) has just said, and, indeed, as the hon. Member for Coventry, East (Mr. Crossman) said in opening—and to replace it with a graduated scheme that would have no lower or upper limit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The suggestion in the Bill, of course, is for graduated contributions to begin after earnings of £9 a week, up to a maximum of £15 earnings. The Amendment proposes an 8½ per cent. graduated contribution on all earnings, however large or small, despite the fact that the hon. Member for Coventry, East, somewhere in his speech, mentioned a maximum of £2,000——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Crossman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was referring to what was in our scheme, as distinct from the Amendments. We are seeking to amend the Government scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Pitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Were these five Amendments to succeed, one of the incidental effects, as my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Sir S. Summers) pointed out, would be that the age of entry would
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0048">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
be reduced from the 18 years proposed to 16 years. I want to ask one simple question: what happens to those below 16? At the present moment young people have to pay insurance contributions if they leave school at fifteen and start work. Has that been thought of? However, I do not want to pursue that, because I realise that it is part of the universality that hon. Members opposite have in mind in seeking to introduce this lower age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another of the Amendments now under discussion would remove the quinquennial increases. The purpose of those increases is to meet the rising cost of pensions, and it is worth spending a moment to consider this point. Our purpose was to avoid taking too much by way of contributions on the introduction of the new pensions scheme. We realise that the need for further revenue will increase with the years, because we are an ageing population, but the Government thought it wrong to take too much money, and to build up too big a surplus in the initial stages of the scheme. Hence the quinquennial increases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should also bear in mind that there are now rather more than 7 million people over pensionable age, and that in twenty years' time there will be more than 9½ million. Similarly, the number of pensioners in the population will rise even more rapidly. Because of the introduction of comprehensive national insurance in 1946, more and more people are acquiring rights under national insurance and we already have just over 5 million people drawing pensions, and will have about 7½ million in twenty years' time. It is this fact that lies behind the need to provide for quinquennial increases, but the Bill gives my right hon. Friend the power not to introduce those quinquennial increases if the funds are in a better state than was anticipated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Crossman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Lady saying that the arrangement of quinquennial increases will more adequately meet the need for increased contributions within the graded contributions? I do not understand that. The graded contributions go up with income. If national wages increase by 2 per cent. a year, we have a steady increase of revenue as a result of the increase of the national wage level. Therefore, our system is realistic and
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
just, whereas the Government's system of a flat rate bears most heavily on the lowest paid worker, and there is being put on to him the quinquennial increase in addition to a flat rate poll tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Pitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is true that with a system of graduated contributions the income remains flexible and rises with the increase in incomes in the community. The difference between the two sides of the Committee is that the Opposition, through these Amendments, would build up a very considerable surplus in the early years. They would take far more money than they would pay out in benefits. The Government, being more realistic, say: " We will take so much money now to pay out immediate benefits, but because of the rising number of old people in the population we shall need additional money in the years ahead, hence the quinquennial increase which will take the money at the time when it is needed." I hope that is quite clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members opposite, of course, will argue that the quinquennial increases are not needed under their Amendments. I wonder if that is really so. They will certainly build up a surplus in the early years, as I understand it, from their scheme, and they have confidently predicted that in their speeches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Crossman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We did not say we would have a surplus. We said that where the benefits were miserably low we wanted to increase them, and we were responsible enough to raise sufficient money to pay better benefits. It must not be thought that we are just piling up money. We have decided to give better benefits than the Government, and we recognise that it will need bigger contributions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Pitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If hon. Members opposite are to have money for something on the lines of their own superannuation plan they must provide for a considerable surplus in the early years. Perhaps they might use that for back-door nationalisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make this point. It seems to me to be a very genuine one. The estimated surplus may not be nearly as much as hon. Members opposite have estimated if contracting out takes place on a very considerable scale. If the scheme which the Amendments endeavour to impose were adopted, all
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0049">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
those who could contract out would certainly do so. That is one of the problems, and one of the things on which I am not clear. I think that over the years, leaving aside the question of how many would contract out, the scheme on the lines which the Amendments envisage would run into very considerable deficit because the burdens would be so heavy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Crossman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Lady tell us whether we are having too much or too little. She seems to be implying both.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Pitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am confessing my lack of understanding of exactly what will be achieved by the scheme as proposed by hon. Members opposite. They proposed to build up a surplus at the wrong time, in the early stages, and the scheme would run very considerably into debt towards the end of the century. They would be paying out much higher benefits and would run up against the same difficulty as the present national insurance scheme, that of being considerably on the wrong side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point on which I would like information from hon. Members opposite is what happens about the short-term benefits. The hon. Member for Coventry, East made it quite clear that he was envisaging paying unemployment and sickness benefit on the graduated scale in exactly the same way as he envisaged paying the retirement pension. What happens to the conditions of entitlement to these benefits? Virtually we should be scrapping the existing national insurance scheme with its flat rate benefits and contributions. How, then, will one prove entitlement to the short-term benefits? At the present moment, contributors have to pay a minimum of 26 contributions before they are eligible for unemployment or sickness benefit, and their entitlement in succeeding years depends on their previous year's contribution record—50 contributions being necessary for full benefit. Similarly, with retirement benefit a maximum of 156 contributions must be paid, and again the rate of benefit depends on the average of contributions over the years. If you have not a flat rate contribution, how are you going to define the conditions under which people will enjoy these benefits?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Lady is not expecting me to answer these questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Pitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg your pardon, Mr. Blackburn. I should also like to ask if hon. Members opposite have considered some of the other benefits, such as maternity benefit and death grant. How are the conditions of eligibility for these benefits to be defined. I think that if conditions were to be laid down for all these benefits to be paid out of the graduated scheme, it would need another Bill. That would be outside the scope of discussion at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of contributions paid is very important. I hope that we shall have some comments on it from hon. Members opposite. The effect of their Amendments would be an 8½ per cent. rate of contributions on earnings, however low or high. Another minor detail is that industrial injuries contributions and health contributions would have to be paid in addition, because there is no power in the Bill to do away with them. I think that the proposition put forward now would put a burden on the higher paid workers much heavier than they would have to bear under the Bill which we are now discussing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Crossman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is true.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Pitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to give some figures which I think might also go on record under the proposition advanced by these Amendments. An employee earning £4,000 a year would pay in contributions £170 a year and the employer would pay the same. If that is thought not to be not the most suitable example to take, I will give that of the £2,000 a year man, who has already crept into our discussion. His contribution would be £85 a year and his employer's the same, and, if we reduce that to the terms which most of us generally use, his contributions would be 34s. a week, or a combined contribution of 68s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will come to another common example, that of the £1,000 a year man. He is reflected in many of the weekly wage earners in this country today. When I tell some of them, as I do at times, that they are in the £1,000 a year class, they lift a surprised eyebrow and say, " That is not right; I am getting only £20 a week." This is a fairly representative example of some of the better-paid
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0050">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
skilled workers today. I want to stress that under the Amendments the contributions of such a man would be £42 10s. a year and his employer would be paying the same, or, in the terms which are most often used, the man himself would pay 17s. a week and the combined contribution would be 34s.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bernard Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that different from the position that exists today? There are nearly 9 million people in occupational schemes at this moment and they are putting much more than 4¼ per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Reynolds</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I came into the House of Commons, I was in the position of paying 5 per cent. contribution on a salary of just over £1,000. The Government have forced teachers to pay 6 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Pitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that if hon. Members opposite study the Government Actuary's Report on occupational pension schemes, they will see their infinite variety. The point is that the people concerned choose their employment and understand before they enter it that they have to pay contributions at that level,</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are some people who have not had the right of choice because some of the employers do not cater for occupational schemes. It does not undermine the fundamental argument that those who are in occupational schemes pay more than 4¼ per cent. and pay 5 per cent. or 6 per cent. in some cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Pitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the other side of the penny. The hon. Gentleman is now saying that certain people are denied the opportunity to contribute at those rates. I want to stress that there is an element of choice in the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Margaret Herbison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I come to the first side of the penny with which the hon. Lady was dealing. She said that people choose the type of job or profession knowing that they will have to pay superannuation. I can remember sitting in a room as crowded as this when the superannuation Measure for teachers was being considered, when the Government were insisting that there should be an increase in respect of the thousands of teachers who had already chosen a profession. The Government did not think it a great hardship to raise the contribution from 5 to 6 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Pitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be out of order if I developed this much further. I am perfectly happy to go on, so long as the Chairman does not rule me out of order. Perhaps he will allow me to say something on this, as he has a particular interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Chairman has no interest except seeing that the Standing Orders are carried out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Pitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I might be allowed briefly to say that the teachers, when they entered their profession, chose a profession which carried a contributory pension scheme. The difference between 5 and 6 per cent. is the difference in the value they are getting. However, I do not think that has a bearing on what we are discussing at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Crossman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady has been talking about freedom of choice. We propose to put down an Amendment to the Bill to restore freedom of choice. The figures she has read out relate to the national scheme under the amended Bill. We are going to have a graduated national scheme consisting of those who are in the national scheme and have not contracted out. There will be a choice. Most people earning £2,000 a year will have the choice between a private scheme and the national scheme. The contributions for £2,000 a year in our Amendment are modest compared with those in most schemes catering for £2,000 a year workers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Pitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If hon. Members opposite really mean that they wish the contracting out provisions to be successful in the scheme they propose, with contributions as high as they now propose on the higher paid workers, I am certain that as many as possible of the higher paid workers would get out of the national scheme. Where, then, is our income? What we would be left with would be the residue of the lower-paid workers, who are going to get a very much better bargain out of it and who will be a further heavy financial burden on our income. I think that is a very proper point to make
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to take up one or two of the other points which have been made. In opening, the hon. Member for Coventry, East said that the present flat rate
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0051">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
scheme tied the scheme to the lowest paid workers. With that I entirely agree. It is because we have had this change in the post-war years, with the level of incomes and the standard of life people enjoy going up so considerably, that there is such a very marked difference between what a man enjoys when he is at work and what he has to accept when he retires. The hon. Gentleman went on to ask how Her Majesty's Government would defend the level of the contributions on the proposed range between £9 and £15 per week. I would say that £9 represents about the lowest wage for a full-time worker today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Crossman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: For a male worker.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Pitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, and that takes up the point of the hon. Gentleman the Member for Motherwell (Mr. Lawson) who was talking about the contribution which the £6 to £7-a-week man would pay. In the main, those would only be people on part-time work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Steele</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could we have the facts right? When the hon. Lady talks about wages, does she mean earnings in the sense that this graded contribution will have to be paid out of overtime, extra payments and all those other things?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Pitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am talking of earnings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Harriet Slater</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Lady not aware that although the figure is put at £9 a week that will still leave out 3 million men and 4¾ million women, a considerable number to leave out?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Pitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to know who those people are who are earning below the lowest amount.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Slater</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Shop assistants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Pitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should think that in the years ahead many would go above the £9 per week level.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lawson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister has given the number who would be below the £9 per week limit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Pitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is in the Government Actuary's Report on the Bill. The graduation proposed up to £15 represents, in the view of Her Majesty's Government, what it is reasonable compulsorily to make people provide for their old age. We genuinely feel that above that level it is better to leave people free to make their own arrangements, which brings me
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
to the next point of the hon. Member for Coventry, East. He said that those in occupational pension schemes were only the better-off.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Crossman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Pitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I took down the right hon. Gentleman's words. If I have them wrong I will apologise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Crossman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that in the beginning that tended to be so, but afterwards some industrial workers came in. They certainly started with the better-off.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Pitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not really accurate. Had the hon. Gentleman any real experience of helping to administer these occupational schemes, and, indeed, participating in them, he would know that in many cases they started with the staff, and often the scheme was followed by one introduced for manual workers. In any event, what is the difference these days between the staff and the workers on the floor of the shop? There used to be a great deal of difference. Once it was thought wonderful to be a white collar worker, but now it is the man on the floor of the shop who gets the better pay packet and the better conditions. Similarly, he expects and in many cases is enjoying, additional benefits originally enjoyed by the staff. It is wrong to suggest that these schemes are available only to some higher-paid workers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Herbison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Lady trying to argue that almost every person working on the shop floor is covered by occupational schemes? We say that that is not the case. Also, is the hon. Lady not at all concerned about the 70 per cent. of the women in this country who are not covered by occupational schemes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Pitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is that about half the male workers are in occupational schemes. As for the women, certainly I believe in any developments which help women, but we have to remember also the practical point that a large number of women marry and are not so vitally interested in such things as are the men. The hon. Gentleman objected to the imposition of a compulsory graduated scheme for everybody being described as dictation, and yet said that Her Majesty's Government were applying dictation to the £9 to £15 per week workers. If that is so, the dictation applies only to a limited band of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0052">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
earnings. Those with above £15 a week would still contribute, but the dictation applies to a limited range of earnings. I believe the country would not be willing to accept complete control through a State insurance scheme of so much of people's money up to unlimited amounts, such as would arise if the Amendments were taken literally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want also to draw a comparison in regard to the hon. Gentleman's question: " What are occupational schemes if they are not dictation "? There is the free choice of which we spoke, where people enter employment where such a scheme is operating and are told of it. I have done that over and over again as a personnel officer, telling a new employee, " We have a pension scheme, and after three months you will be eligible to join, and we expect all employees to join." There is a choice there on entering that employment, but there would be no such choice under a scheme such as is envisaged in the Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe I have dealt with most of the observations I wanted to make on the discussion so far. I would end by saying that I believe that if these arrangements were accepted the results on savings in this country could be disastrous. There would be no private saving, and it is from private saving that we hope to obtain the investment that will improve our standard of living and help us to increase productivity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Crossman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady says if our Amendments are carried they will be disastrous to private saving. My hon. Friend has shown that our Amendments would mean a decrease in the rate of contribution for practically every worker under the average wage. How would that be disastrous to saving? If we are to have graded contributions it actually benefits the lower-paid worker to be graded in this way. If my hon. Friend's figures are correct—I have no reason to doubt them—it is proved that up to £14 per week the people at the top would pay almost the same in the grading; they would gain increasingly, as we have proved that the Government scheme would bear most heavily on the lowest-paid worker.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Pitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Motherwell has spoken of what those earning £7 or £8 per week would have to pay. I wish to stress that through
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
taking so much money for a graduated State scheme there would be less available for saving. I believe that a scheme such as the Amendments endeavour to superimpose on the Bill would be highly inflationary and dangerous to the economy of the country, as a result of which the people who would suffer most would be the existing pensioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, the proposed scheme seeks to alter the shape of the Bill. In fact, it is completely opposed to what is contained in the Bill. It is not insurance, as I hope I have shown this morning. I believe the hon. Gentleman "let the cat out of the bag " when he spoke of income being taxed. I hope he will recognise that what he has said is in the minds of all hon. Members opposite even though they have not so frankly avowed themselves as wanting, through the effect of these Amendments, to achieve a social tax which would have as its object the redistribution of income. It is not insurance, and for that reason I ask Members to reject the Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. R. E. Prentice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the hon. Lady but it was not until nearly the end of her speech that I found something on which I could agree with her, when she said that the purpose of this group of Amendments was to alter the character of the Bill. Of course, that is the purpose. That was mentioned by the hon. Gentleman the Member for Aylesbury (Sir S. Summers) when he said we were getting as close as the rules of order permitted so as to bring the Government's miserable Bill in the direction of our own Labour Party scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, East (Mr. Crossman) in moving these Amendments took the opportunity, as he is entitled to do, to argue the differences in principle between a universal system of graded contributions for comprehensive superannuation and the Government scheme. My main criticism of the hon. Lady's speech is that she has not attempted to answer fundamental points. Rather she has picked out what she considers to be points of detail on which she thought we were wrong, some of which I should like to answer. She did not, however, answer the central point of principle which is involved, whether or not we should have a comprehensive system of graded pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0053">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
The hon. Lady said there would be difficulty about short-term benefits, such as unemployment and sickness, and asked how people would qualify for them and what kind of rules we should propose for the necessary contribution conditions. I believe it is fair to point out that in connection with our Amendments we have included only short-term benefits, as we had to in the light of the Bill. The Labour Party scheme refers to retirement pensions and widowhood. But surely it would not be beyond the wit of the Department to devise a scheme under which eligibility for benefit is based on the number of weeks' contributions made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to say a word on what was said by the hon. Lady on the element of choice which exists in private schemes. She is criticised by the Opposition for bringing in an element of compulsion, but she says that in connection with private schemes at the moment people can accept or reject a job which has superannuation as one of its conditions, and that as a personnel officer she had put that alternative to applicants for positions. That is not really a good example, for in many professions one has to belong to a superannuation scheme. For example, a teacher has to accept compulsory superannuation as one of the conditions of being a teacher. It is very academic to say these people have a choice although, of course, they have the choice of leaving the profession and going down a mine, perhaps—but if they were to go down a mine they would still need superannuation. It is an academic point to raise in defence of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tiley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has chosen a most unfortunate example in the teachers. The teacher can get his money back, in cash, at any time he leaves the profession. Also, he can get cash under the retirement scheme. Under the State scheme that does not happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Prentice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that a teacher can get his money back if he leaves the profession, but so long as he remains in the profession of his choice he is subject to compulsion and remains in a compulsory superannuation scheme. What is more, most teachers welcome that. If we were to take a ballot among teachers I believe they would not be demanding freedom to make their own
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
provision for old age. They would prefer their scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tiley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because they themselves control it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Anthony Kershaw</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman also reflect that not all teachers are in State service but that a teacher can go on to teach in private service as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Prentice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is such a small percentage——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kershaw</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it is a large percentage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Prentice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: —that it is almost an academic point. I am saying that for most workers covered by compulsory superannuation schemes in trade or the professions there is not that element of choice which Her Majesty's Government are pretending exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to make a further comment on the hon. Lady's observations regarding those earning below £9 a week. I understand that there are 4¾ million women workers and some 3 million male workers earning below £9 per week. There are fairly large groups of workers within this category. There are people who work in shops, on the railways and in agriculture, and my hon. Friend the Member for Ince (Mr. T. Brown) has pointed out that about a quarter of those employed in the mines are earning less than an average of £9 a week. At the time of the bus strike last year we were reminded that many grades working for the London Transport Executive, such as garage workers, were earning less than £9; indeed some were earning less than £8.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The position in the mining industry is that the basic wage of surface workers—about 25 per cent. of the total employed—is now less than £9 a week, with the abolition of Saturday working and the almost complete abolition of overtime during the week. So, a quarter of those in the mining industry would not be affected, because their remuneration is less than £9 a week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Prentice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for confirming that point. Hon. Members opposite seem to be brushing aside the groups earning below £9 a week as though they constituted a very small
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0054">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
proportion of the total number of workers. Included in those groups are those who are ill or disabled to such an extent that they can work only part-time, and who earn less than £9. Many of them will be permanently in that position. We say that people in that category should be able to earn better pension rights than are proposed in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to examine in more detail the effect of our Amendment on these people. The hon. Lady said that the Government were anxious to avoid taking too much from them. Indeed, the Conservative Party pamphlet starts off by saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A sound scheme. Lower paid workers pay less ",</p></blockquote>
as though that was something to boast about. I would remind the Committee that it was the Government who imposed these very high flat rate contributions on the lower-paid workers. These flat rate contributions have been increased three times in the last two years, twice in order to pay for the Health Service and once to help pay for the pensions increases a year ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present rate of 9s. 11d. a week for the adult male worker is about 50 per cent. more than it was two years ago, and it is rather artful of the Conservative Party to say that they want the lower-paid workers to pay less when they themselves imposed this vicious increase so recently. The Bill proposes that many of those earning less than £9 a week shall go on paying 9s. 11d. Those who are employed in firms who contract out will go on paying 9s. 11d., and will not receive anything extra under the Bill. Even the remainder, who will have a modest decrease in contributions, down to 8s. 4d. a week, are threatened that this may be raised in the quinquennial reviews.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These heavy contributions being paid by people earning less than £9 a week might be justifiable if the Government were paying them extra benefits, but since the Bill provides no extra benefits there is a strong case for carrying our Amendment on that ground alone. We say that the contribution shall be 4¼ per cent. on all incomes, and 4¼ per cent. of £9 a week is 8s. 4d., so that those earning less than £9 will have a substantial reduction in contributions. We are saying that if there is no increase in benefits there should at least be a decrease in the contributions
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
which the lower paid workers are expected to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady avoided the main theme of the debate this morning, which is that we are trying to bring the scheme as near as possible to a comprehensive superannuation scheme. The hon. Member for Huddersfield, West (Mr. Wade) said that it seemed to him that the Government Bill was a compromise between the existing National Insurance system and the Labour Party scheme. He has been far too generous in his remarks about the Government scheme. It is not a superannuation scheme at all, and we attack it not because it is a compromise but because it is something totally different from our plan. Clause 1 is really an enactment of the principle dealt with in paragraph 32 of the White Paper. Speaking of the scope of Government action in this field the White Paper said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the state to go further would be to arrogate to itself the individual's right to dispose of his income in what he thinks is the right way, and would seriously undermine the individual's sense of responsibility for his own affairs."</p></blockquote>
That contention must be considered from the point of view of what we have already discussed, namely, that private schemes impose compulsory superannuation on the individual worker. That is something which the workers themselves welcome. Workers who have not got it are demanding it through their trade unions. This makes nonsense of the remarks in the White Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are surrendering to what the insurance companies imagine to be their interests. The insurance companies want to keep for themselves this field of superannuation, free from Government intrusion. Whether or not they are right in their view I do not know, but ever since the Labour Party scheme was proposed insurance companies have been falling over each other to issue pamphlets based essentially upon the same grounds as those mentioned in paragraph 32 of the White Paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Frederick Gough</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must declare my interest in this matter, because this is the first opportunity that I have had to speak. I am interested in these schemes. I have here a speech, which many hon. Members will have read, given by Mr. Kitton, Chairman of the Life Offices' Association. His speech contains a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0055">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
number of conclusions, the first of which is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The economic well being of the country is of primary importance. No State scheme should be allowed to impair this or to encourage inflationary pressure."</p></blockquote>
What the actuarial profession has said is that the scheme of the Labour Party is inflationary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not discussing that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Prentice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I reply on the question whether or not it is inflationary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We had better keep to the terms of the Amendment.

In line 31, leave out " nine " and insert " three ".

I hope that when we reach that group we shall not have a repetition of the speeches that we have had on this one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Prentice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would simply add that the speech to which the hon. Member for Horsham (Mr. Gough) has referred was unpopular with many other people at the conference at which it was given. Many publications put out by insurance companies since the Labour Party produced its scheme have criticised it not only on the alleged ground that it is inflationary but also on the ground that it is wrong in principle for the State to intervene in a field which, the insurance companies say, should be for the private individual. It is on that point that we are in fundamental disagreement with the insurance companies and hon. Members opposite.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the folklore of the Conservative Party to oppose every major advance of the Welfare State on the ground that, somehow or other, it will interfere with rugged individualism. Going back to the first old-age pensions, before 1908 the Conservatives were saying that they would destroy the British Empire by destroying our sense of individuality. [HON. MEMBERS: "Nonsense."] I agree that it is nonsense, but that is what they
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
were saying. It is in the same tradition that our Amendments are being resisted this morning. We are told that the individual, except to a very limited extent, should make his own contribution for his old age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know how many hon. Members opposite have spoken at old-age pensioners' meetings on these matters, but I had that experience last week, and it reminded me of something of which I think everybody should be reminded. Those who were working in the bad days of the 1920s and 1930s in many cases could not save at all, because of the economic conditions of the depression, but even if they were able to save they have lived to see the value of their savings go down until they are now one-third or an even smaller fraction of their original value. That makes nonsense of the suggestion that those people should have made personal provision for their old age by saving.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only way of avoiding that situation is by comprehensive superannuation. If hon. Members opposite are sincere in saying that they want to see private schemes spread, as is stated in the White Paper, they should logically go on to say that where there cannot be a private scheme the State should provide one. If, on the other hand, they are against our scheme because, as they say, it is inflationary, they should also be against private schemes, and discourage instead of encourage them. They cannot have it both ways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The real issue before the Committee is whether the contributions to the proposed scheme shall be upon a flat rate or a graduated basis. From what the hon. Lady said it seems that the Government are clinging to the past and neglecting the opportunities of the future in respect of the contribution provisions of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The flat rate in social insurance has been with us for a long time—first in health insurance and later in pensions, about which I shall say something in a moment. But the first provision for old age and retirement was not made upon a contributory basis. In the palmy days of the Liberal movement, in 1908, the provision for old age was made a direct charge upon the Exchequer. Much of what has been said this morning reminds
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0056">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
me that a noble Lord, speaking during the passage of the 1908 Bill, said that the estimated expenditure to provide for old age, which was to be about £2 million at that time, would bring financial catastrophe to the country. However, in 1911, when the first National Health Insurance Scheme was instituted, and when contributory old-age pensions were established in 1925, most individuals subscribed to the flat rate principle, and have continued to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of us believe that in our modern society the time has come for a new approach, and it is on that basis that we have been prompted to move the Amendment. We feel that the graded contribution is more easily worked and administered, more equitable, and more practical than the system proposed in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a number of approaches to the question of the provision for old age and retirement, and hon. Members on both sides of the Committee agree, at least, that the insurance principle shall continue. The fundamental cleavage concerns the way in which the contributions shall be made, and the basis of their collection. We believe that our system will impose a much smaller burden on the lower income groups than will the Government proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Motherwell (Mr. Lawson) said that people earning much less than £9 a week would pay a much greater proportion than 4¼ per cent. It is for this reason that we feel that what we propose is more financially correct, more equitable, and more practical; it is facing up to the opportunities which modern society presents to us that the contributions should be on a graduated basis instead of being on a flat rate basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Reynolds</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In regard to the remarks made by the hon. Lady in regard to the exorbitant amount people in the £1,000 and £2,000 a year groups would have to pay if our Amendments were carried, I think she was slightly under in her estimate. She did not include the industrial injuries contribution or the Health Service contribution. People in private schemes paying 5 per cent. and 6 per cent. also have to pay the existing national insurance contributions. An adult man has to pay 9s. 11d. weekly,
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
including the national health and industrial injury contribution. Thus, with our Amendments there would be the addition of the industrial injuries contribution and national health contribution which are already there, though 4¼ per cent. plus industrial injuries, plus national health contribution would be the lot. So far as contributions are concerned, the vast majority of people earning over £1,000 a year who are in private schemes pay between 5 per cent. and 6 per cent. plus industrial injuries and national health and plus the flat rate. It is necessary to look at the total payments the individual has to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regarding the figures which have been given to us, for the moment we can assume that the calculations, though probably not right to the exact million pounds or so, are a fairly good indication of what the position would be, and it is fair to assume there will be what the hon. Lady calls a surplus. But is it really a " surplus "?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One objection to the Bill is that it does not make any provision for increasing existing pensions, but we must assume that sooner or later—and presumably before 1962 if wages keep going up—there will have to be an increase in existing pensions. I assume, therefore, from the way the present Government proposals work, that there is also going to be an increase in contributions on the flat rate and on the graduated rate. As figures show at the present moment, if any alteration were made in the flat rate pension there would have to be alterations to the contribution, and I can see us getting near to the 4¼ per cent. by the Government's own method before many years have passed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It must not be assumed that this is a surplus that will be available for what the hon. Lady called back-door nationalisation or any other purpose. It may well be needed in a short time to give a square deal to existing pensioners without having to alter contributions again. Before this scheme actually comes into operation in 1960 or 1961, the contributions laid down in the Bill are likely to be considerably exceeded because of alterations that will have to be made. If we go over completely to a percentage contribution there will be far less likelihood of the necessity to make alterations when bask pensions are increased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0057">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
On the whole, when the benefit, either flat rate or graduated, is increased, it will mean that there has been an increase in incomes generally and that increase in incomes will bring in extra money to the fund to meet the cost of benefit. In the way proposed at the moment on the graduated rate there will be some extra income for the fund, but it is hardly likely to be sufficient under the system proposed in the Bill, without raising the flat rate contributions, to meet any extra amount required to increase present pensions. Thus, as the Bill stands at the moment, contributions are going to be out-dated before they are introduced, and will need to be superseded by further Bills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As things stand at the moment, and on the Government Actuary's pessimistic assumption of 2 per cent. increase in wages each year—I think I am right in saying that, while there was virtually a wage freeze in operation, there was a 4 per cent. increase in incomes during 1958—the average wage of £12 10s. a week will in ten years' time have gone up to about £16. Gradually, perhaps in the course of some twenty years, we are going to be back with a flat rate pension and a flat rate contribution based on £15 a week for the majority of contributors, and the benefit equivalent to £15 becoming the flat rate benefit for the majority. In my opinion, it may come even quicker than the pessimistic attitude of the Government Actuary would seem to suggest, and we shall have to go into the whole question again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason, it is essential to build into the scheme right from the beginning a percentage contribution which will go a fair way up the wages scale, realising then that the only alteration that will be needed as incomes gradually increase is to keep the £2,000 figure in the same relation to average earnings as it is at the moment. Then as wages go up, the only change needed if the Amendments are accepted, will be to put up the upper limit on which contributions are paid. It will give us real wage related contributions coupled with wage related benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regarding the position of the people below £9 a week, it must follow that as wages go up more people under £9 a week will come into the scheme, and over a period of ten to fifteen years a very
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
large proportion of these people are going to pay wage related contributions under the scheme proposed in the Bill as it stands at the present time. That is all right, but, of course, even those aged 30 at the present time and earning £7 per week will in ten or twelve years' time, on the 2 per cent. basis, be earning £9 a week and will be contributiong to the scheme. But they will then be 42 and will not get much benefit from the scheme. The benefits will be very small, as extra contributions are going to be made only for a limited number of years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope to bring these people below £9 into the scheme from the beginning. We should not make them wait for years. The hon. Lady seems to forget that she is one of only a little over 250,000 women earning more than £15 a week. The average earnings for women are £612s. 3d. In fairness to those lower paid workers, graded contributions should be given to everyone with the addition of industrial injury and the health charge. Everyone would then start building up pension rights from the day the scheme comes into operation, which would make it unnecessary to keep increasing contributions and would make it possible for the scheme to continue for a considerable number of years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Minister to stop being as supercilious as he has been during the past few years about the proposals that we have put forward, and let us have a Bill which will deal with pensions and social security rather than with financial manipulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Slater</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, East (Mr. Crossman) asked a very pointed question which I do not think the hon. Lady answered, why the figures of £9 to £15 were chosen. The White Paper begins by saying that one of the greatest problems of our age is how best to make provision for the old. So right at the beginning of the argument the problem is admitted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper goes on to say it must be ensured that State action does not undermine the personal responsibility of each of us to make such provision as we can for old age, but, having said that, it failed to consider the vast numbers of people who under the Bill have very little opportunity of making provision themselves for old age. So the last statement
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0058">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
really applied only to those people who are well over the £15 income grade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In leaving out of any provision the vast number of people at £9 a week, we leave out about 3 million men and 4¾ million women. The hon. Lady also made the point that many women get married, and, therefore, need not be considered as a very great problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Pitt</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I might just say, in fairness to my own sex, that my comment was that more and more women got married and were not so interested in pensions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Slater</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is almost the same thing. More and more married women are staying on at work. During the last six years about half a million more married women have been staying on at work than in the six years previously. It is true that when a woman gets married she may interrupt her working years, but many go back in ten or fifteen years. Therefore, to leave this large number of women out is unjust and unfair to a very large section of the working population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady asks what sort of people have less than £9 a week income. One of my hon. Friends indicated the number of men who are face workers in the collieries. Yet the general public has the idea that all miners are getting good rates of pay. There are also railway workers and bus workers, and among the women large numbers of nurses do not by any means get £9 a week, although they have to do a very hard and exacting job with very long hours. There are many workers outside the London areas who get very much less than £9 a week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are also the shop assistants. The average wage in the distributive trades is about £7 15s. a week, and the number of people engaged in them is increasing rather than decreasing. They are left out completely. There are some welfare workers employed by industrial firms and local authorities who get less than £9. I question whether more than a handful of the manual workers in the potteries or the cotton mills get anything like £9. But all those people are to be ignored. The Conservatives imply that this scheme is to aid the lower-paid workers, but a large section of them are completely ignored.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
Why should these people not be included right from the beginning? If we are to have a pension scheme at all it should be comprehensive. It should take in all workers, even from the age of 16. Unless it is comprehensive, it is not a pension scheme. It is merely playing with the problem, and attempting to bluff the general public that something is being done when the fact is that nothing is being done for large numbers——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond Gower</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady says that if we are to have a pension scheme it must be comprehensive, but why should she say that in a tone suggesting that it is some ancient truth that cannot be argued?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Slater</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even if it is an ancient truth, this Bill ignores it. There is no attempt to make this a comprehensive scheme at all——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Vice-Admiral John Hughes Hallett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not quite follow the hon. Lady's argument. I understood from what was said earlier in the debate that these Amendments would not have the effect of increasing the contribution of the lower-paid workers. If that is so, how can those people insure themselves for higher pensions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Slater</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If these Amendments were accepted, all people would be included. The scheme would not leave out more than 7 million people who are now excluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another reason for including those whom it is now proposed to leave out is that these are the people who can do least during their working lives to save for old age If any hon. Members doubt that, let them look at the food survey, which shows the percentage of wages spent on food, rent and clothes by the lower income groups as compared with the higher income groups. It will be seen that before they can even start to think about provision for old age a large part of their income is already taken for food and bare necessities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the reasons that I have given, we definitely feel that the Government have given no proper reason for their use of the figures of £9 and £15. In paragraph 27 of the White Paper, they say that then-case points
	<br><blockquote><p>"… to the need for a new and bold step away from the universal flat-rate system."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0059">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
In the face of that statement, they seek to continue to maintain the flat-rate system for large numbers of people, and to allow only a very narrow group to come within the graded scheme. We think that that is unjust, unreasonable and illogical, and we hope that by Tuesday next the Minister will have seriously looked at our figures and at the whole problem to see whether he has not made a very grave mistake in these proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Crossman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure you will appreciate that there is a basic difference between the two groups.

I do not ask that we should be allowed to repeat all these arguments again when we reach those Amendments, but I do ask that we should have a separate debate later, because the issue of ceiling and floor is a different issue from that of a graded scheme without a ceiling or floor.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boyd-Carpenter</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that we need quarrel about it, Mr. Blackburn. As you said when you quite properly corrected me, we have taken a group of five Amendments and, in

debating them, we have used arguments that would, perhaps, be equally relevant to the next batch. However, you will no doubt feel that that does not debar you, if you so wish, from calling the next batch, having given the intimation that you have given that we might not feel it necessary to repeat the same arguments. That being the case, it might be convenient to complete our present discussion of this batch of five Amendments, and then leave ourselves clear, with the good will of the Committee, to start our discussion of the next three at our Tuesday sitting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Crossman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must say that a good many more of my hon. Friends have further points to raise on this batch of Amendments. We thought that we were now to get from the Minister a sort of interim reply to what has been said so far. I was hoping that on Tuesday we might get some discussion of the figures we have given, and replies to a number of other points that it was not fair to ask a Minister to reply to today—our longer-term points. I thought that he would reply today to the shorter points, and deal with the others on Tuesday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boyd-Carpenter</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a very full discussion of what is, after all, only the first batch of Amendments. I hope that we can conduct the Committee on a basis of mutual goodwill. I certainly do not wish in any way to terminate the discussion, but I hoped that, with good will, if we could deal with this present batch of five Amendments, leaving open our discussion on the next three—subject always to what you, Mr. Blackburn, have said and to your Ruling—it would, perhaps, be for the convenience of the Committee. I have no doubt that, if the hon. Member for Coventry, East (Mr. Crossman) wishes me to deal at our next sitting with the figures that have been put forward, I should be in order to deal with them then, or on the Motion, " That the Clause stand part of the Bill." I do not wish to appear in any way to dictate to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dealing with the points that have been raised on these Amendments, I start with the curious fact that they embody proposals that nobody wants. They are not the Labour Party's scheme, nor are they the scheme in the Bill. I must say that I am lost in admiration at their
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0060">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
ingenuity because I, too, am not without experience, when in opposition, of drafting Amendments that would facilitate discussion, while keeping within the rules of order, of proposals completely different—as my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Sir S. Summers) has pointed out that these proposals are—from those in the Bill to which the House has given a Second Reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These Amendments raise two main points. First, they abolish any flat rate. Indeed, the hon. Member for Coventry, East took credit for that. He said that it was simpler not to have a flat rate and a graduated scheme in the same system. Secondly, they enlarge the scope of the Government's proposals enormously, both upwards and downwards; they remove the floor and the ceiling. Perhaps I may take those two main issues in that order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First of all, we have the abolition of the flat rate. As I understood both the hon. Member for Coventry, East and his hon. Friend the Member for Motherwell (Mr. Lawson), that is not the Labour Party's scheme. That scheme, as I understand it, contemplates a continuation of the flat rate—I think inevitably so, and for reasons that are, of themselves, fatal to the validity of these Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, there is the practical point that was put by my hon. Friend the Joint Parliamentary Secretary—and here I agree, incidentally, with the hon. Member for Mansfield (Mr. B. Taylor)—that this is, and should continue, to be, an insurance scheme——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I said that there was agreement on both sides.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boyd-Carpenter</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: And I am agreeing with the hon. Gentleman, to make the agreement even happier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can we deal with the contribution conditions unless there is a flat rate contribution to which reference can be made from the point of view of determining eligibility for flat rate benefits—sickness, unemployment and so on? Secondly, how can we do without that system when the industrial injuries contribution is on a flat rate basis? It is not proposed to alter that. There is also the flat rate National Health Service contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, how would we deal with the contracted-out without a flat rate contribution? Under both schemes, as I under-
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
stand it, the contracted-out are still to be entitled to their flat rate pension, and so must make a flat rate contribution. There must be a flat rate contribution by the contracted-out in respect of their benefits. I think that we start, therefore, on the basis that proposals embodying complete abolition of any flat rate contribution do not face the realities of the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Next, there is the size and the scope of the scheme. There have been opportunities—and I have no doubt that in the course of our debates here and elsewhere there will be many more opportunities—to discuss the totally different concepts of size and scale that are embodied in the scheme for which the hon. Member for Coventry, East is mainly responsible, and in that for which Her Majesty's Government are responsible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is where the gulf between the two parties is very wide. We take a totally different view of the size and scale appropriate to a State national insurance scheme. On this side of the Committee, as in the House, we take the view that it is the proper function of a State scheme to provide something in the nature of a basic minimum. We do not regard it as the proper function of a State scheme to compel people right up the income scale to make proportionate provision for their old age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On this matter I do not think it very likely that either side will convince the other. In their respective views there lies a deep divergence of social and political philosophy. The proposal that has been put before the Committee would compel people, without any limit of income, to make proportionate contributions. These Amendments, of course, do not deal with the question of whether those contributions would produce proportionate benefits, so I would be out of order to discuss that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I rest my argument on the view that it is really not the proper function of a State system to go beyond the moderate level. We may be right or wrong in putting that level at £15 a week—that is a matter of judgment and assessment. Fortunately, we do not at present have to argue about a reasonable figure, as against a completely unlimited one. But, from the point of view of our philosophy, I am quite certain that the right level is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1958-1959V001P0I0061">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
somewhere related to a basic minimum and that, for those above that, whilst one wishes to give them opportunities to make provision for their old age at some level proportionate to what they earned during their working life, it is not for the Government to compel them to do so. It is plain, therefore, that there must be a level, and we think that it must be a moderate level.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
