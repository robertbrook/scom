	<div class='legislation'>Draft Aeroplane Noise (Amendment) Regulations 1999</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Ms Glenda Jackson)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Aeroplane Noise (Amendment) Regulations 1999.</p></blockquote>
It is a pleasure to serve yet again under your chairmanship, Mr. O'Hara.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations are made under the provisions of the European Communities Act 1972 and implement Commission directive 1999/28/EC. In accordance with the procedures introduced by Council directive 98/20/EC of 30 March 1998, this is the first action to amend the schedule of exempted aeroplanes from developing nations which is attached to the directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission has removed 11 aeroplanes from the schedule because they no longer qualify for exemption. Some have been damaged beyond economic repair, while others have moved from the register on which the exemption was granted. The effect of these regulations is to align exemptions in the United Kingdom with directive 98/20/EC by removing those 11 aeroplanes from the schedule that is attached to the Aeroplane Noise Regulations 1999.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the point of view of noise at UK airports, this measure will be beneficial because it will reduce the number of older, noisier aeroplanes that are allowed to fly into the UK. There are no other effects. I commend the regulations to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.32 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Shaun Woodward 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Witney)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, would like to say that it is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. O'Hara.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to talk about the regulations in a little more detail. Several crucial questions arise from them, which I am sure the Minister will be able to answer. The questions go beyond the statutory instrument itself, although I shall take care to remain in order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister made the case for the adoption of this draft statutory instrument. She was right to speak of it as a purely technical measure. Nevertheless, I am somewhat surprised that, in a parliamentary answer which I received today, the Minister confessed to having had no meetings with her officials or anyone else in connection with these regulations. She is, of course, a supremely confident Minister—except in matters relating to her brief on Oxford, but I shall not go into that, as we have already discussed it today on the Floor of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
We do not oppose the regulations, but they raise some important questions. As the Minister said, they bring United Kingdom law into line with European law by implementing the provisions of Commission directive 1999/28/EC of 21 April 1999. As the Minister did not give the background to the measure, it is incumbent on at least one member of the Committee to do so. It is an important issue and, if I may, I shall spend one or two moments outlining what the Minister did not cover.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations fit into a framework of law dating back to the agreement of the assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organisation to phase out so-called chapter 2 aircraft by 31 March 2002. The United Nations advised that, according to a definition of its own, developing countries would suffer economic hardship if they were not granted a period in which the continued use of chapter 2 aircraft would be permitted. Thus it was that when the European Community introduced Council directive 92/14/EEC on the phasing out of chapter 2 aircraft, it published a list of aircraft on the registers of developing countries which would continue to be permitted to fly into member states of the European Economic Area until 31 March 2002.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will know that that measure was amended by Council directive 98/20/EC, which I have looked at, and transposed into British law by SI 1999, No. 1452. That directive also changed the procedure by which further changes to the list of exempted aircraft would be made in the institutions of the European Union. It is important to recognise these documents, as I have questions about them which I am sure that the Minister will be able to answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why we are considering a statutory instrument that is the product of a Commission directive rather than, as previously, a Council directive. As such, it lists aircraft that have been sold to operators in another country, which have crashed and which have otherwise been removed from the register of the developing nation concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition accept that the exemption should not be moveable from register to register, as that would boost the market in noisy and largely pre-1917 chapter 2 aircraft. We also accept that a working list needs to be up to date. It is a real time list, and aircraft should be removed when they no longer exist or qualify for the exemption. As such, the list eliminates the risk that a crashed or abandoned aeroplane could be recovered only to appear again on its national register with the same serial number unique to each airframe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We, therefore, do not oppose the measure. However, I should like to probe the Minister on some background points, and, in my research into this sector of regulation of the aviation industry, I have developed several questions. First, can the Minister tell us what happens to the planes covered by the regulations? I shall make clear my reasons for asking that question. It is important to know whether the 11 planes listed have crashed or been abandoned, and which have been sold to where. If all of them have crashed, there could be a legitimate safety concern at stake, not only about the aeroplanes in question, but about similar models made in similar places. If that information is not available, why does the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0623">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Minister feel so supremely confident as to pass the directive without any consultation and without asking questions about other aircraft?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second area of interest is how the directive was passed. As I mentioned, the directive is the first product of the new comitology procedure on aviation laws. Will the Minister tell us who represents Britain on the Committee that approved the directive by qualified majority voting? Was it a committee of experts or of civil servants, and what is that chain of approval? Is this procedure more effective than the pre-existing Council of Ministers procedure? What is the Minister's personal view, as well as that of her Department, on the change?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to implementation. Will the Minister tell us about the progress of other member states in transposing the legislation into their national law? Has it been implemented, and, crucially, in which other European Union countries? The issue of safety is relevant here; we need to know what other countries the planes may still be able to fly into, as they may end up carrying British passengers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman's remarks, and I raised my eyebrows when he referred to safety. The regulations deal with aircraft noise. As I understand them, they apply to aircraft that no longer exist. I cannot therefore see the relevance of his question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodward</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your observation Mr. O'Hara.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jenny Jones 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wolverhampton, South-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, they do not exist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodward</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that the aircraft no longer exist? Having spoken to officials in various bodies, I understand that they do exist but are not currently used as directed on the list. The list does not relate only to aircraft noise. As I outlined at the beginning of my remarks, the regulations and agreement underlying them date back to a framework of law set up by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, and, therefore, go beyond noise. It is relevant for us to consider those issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are considering a draft statutory instrument that refers specifically to aeroplane noise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodward</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The statutory instrument may deal with noise, but it also covers matters that go beyond noise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There may be a framework of law within which this statutory instrument exists. However, the statutory instrument, which is all that is before the Committee, addresses aeroplane noise only.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodward</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In which case, Mr. O'Hara, I ask the Minister to confirm that the order is only about noise, and that the regulations will in no way touch on matters of safety.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That certainly is in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodward</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Speaking about noise may involve touching on issues on safety, but I shall confine my
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
remarks to noise to ensure that I remain within order, Mr. O'Hara. Can we discover whether the issues of noise have been transposed into legislation in other countries? With regard to noise, which other European Union nations have implemented these regulations? A number of issues may well arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister tell the Committee the legal position if the United Kingdom has implemented the directive, but not other European Union countries? There could be a question of competition interest. In other words, once again the United Kingdom complies with a directive but other European Union countries do not. It is, therefore, important for us to know which other countries have complied and when. If they have not complied, when will they?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.42 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Brake 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carshalton and Wallington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to serve for the first time under your chairmanship, Mr. O'Hara.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should appreciate the Minister's answers to some of the questions raised by the hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Woodward). I should like to know, in particular, which of the aircraft have been destroyed and which have been removed from the register. For my own elucidation, could the Minister confirm whether it is possible for aeroplanes to be removed from the register, be transferred to another nation and then at some point be transferred back to a developing nation such that they might then reappear on the register.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Page 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South-West Hertfordshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Gentleman asks about whether aeroplanes have been destroyed or removed from the register, is he including aeroplanes being broken up and used for spare parts? Noise on an engine is one thing, noise on an air frame another. The offending part of an aircraft could be transferred to another aircraft which then moves back into service. Is that the point that the hon. Gentleman is trying to develop?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brake</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his apposite intervention, and I hope that the Minister will respond on that point. If parts are being transferred and engine parts reused, the initial noise problems could simply be transferred to another aircraft.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, although I accept that the debate is principally about noise, I hope that the Minister will write to me on whether the environmental impact of these aeroplanes is taken into account. The noisiest are likely to pollute the most as well, and I should appreciate any information that is available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.44 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Fabricant 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lichfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is my great pleasure to take part in this interesting debate, Mr. O'Hara. As I was saying before 4.30,1 spent a great deal of time, when I did a real job, travelling in developing and developed nations, setting up radio stations. That involved flying with carriers such as Ethiopian Airlines from places like Kampala, where I built a radio station for Radio Uganda, down to Harare, with Radio Zimbabwe. However, that is not, of course, the main point of the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0624">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
I should like to ask the Minister a question that follows on from the comments that were made by my hon. Friend the Member for Witney and the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Mr. Brake). The Minister said that some of the aircraft would have been damaged and others would have been moved from the register as they moved from a developing country to a non-developing country. Can she tell us what percentage of aircraft have been damaged, and how they were damaged? Were they damaged through crashes or accidents on the ground, or were they destroyed because they had outlived their useful lives? What verification is there that they were damaged? When aircraft—in the shape of bombers—were destroyed in the United States, following the strategic arms limitation talks agreements, there were witnesses. How does the Minister know that the aircraft have been damaged?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will know about companies such as Israel Aircraft Industries, which are experienced and practised in refurbishing old aircraft to high standards. Boeing 707 aircraft that have been refurbished by IAI are in use not only in developing countries, but in developed nations, and meet noise criteria. What would happen if any of those aircraft, which have not been damaged, are repaired by IAI, or a similar company, and brought up to standard? Would they be re-entered on the list?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Page) raised the issue of cannibalisation. Is there a possibility of engines that have been removed from aircraft on the list being put into aircraft that are not on the list? How would that affect the situation in respect of the EU directive? Can the Minister confirm that the current dB A limit for noise at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted is still 97 by day and 89 by night? Does she intend to lower that by 3 dB or more, as was attempted by the previous Administration?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is straying a little beyond the strict terms of the statutory instrument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you for your guidance, Mr. O'Hara.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the dBA were to be altered, would that affect the aircraft that would have to be removed from the list, or, if it were raised, would that enable aircraft to go back on to the list? Can the Minister confirm that it is still her intention to reduce the 97 dBA limit at Heathrow, Stansted and Gatwick?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.48 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There appears to be a great deal of confusion in the minds of Opposition Members. I shall touch on some of the points that were raised by the hon. Member for Witney, who was concerned about whether there had been any consultation between me and my officials before the tabling of the statutory instrument. I am somewhat bemused by that, because it is not clear to me how it would be possible to consult on what is essentially a matter of whether we should furnish the House with information. That is what the statutory instrument does. It lists 11 aeroplanes which are
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
currently, until the publication of the Commission directive, exempted from the existing regulations, which ban the flight into or out of EU airports of aeroplanes whose engines do not meet the necessary noise requirements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall just finish this point. The exemption list for emerging countries has been amended. I understand that 56 aeroplanes are still on that list, of which the statutory instrument refers to 11.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the Minister had.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is a little premature, because I have not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regret that the Committee has not been furnished with the list of the 11 aircraft in question. I will, of course, furnish all members of the Committee with it. However, given that the hon. Members for Witney, for Carshalton and Wallington and, I think, for Lichfield (Mr. Fabricant) all asked the same question, it would perhaps be in order for me to mention just some of the aircraft and the reasons for their deletion from the exemptions list.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reiterate that the exemptions permit aircraft from developing nations to fly into or out of European Union airports even though their engines do not meet the noise requirements that are placed on all other aircraft that fly into or out of those airports. From March 2002, no aircraft will be allowed to contravene the noise regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will because the hon. Gentleman is so desperately anxious to intervene.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always desperately anxious to intervene on the hon. Lady, who is always so willing, keen and generous when it comes to giving way to Back Benchers. Will she confirm that the serial number of aircraft does not change even if an engine is exchanged and the replacement breaches the noise regulations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is entirely right. Every aeroplane has a unique serial number. An aeroplane on the exempt list for developing nations cannot maintain that exemption if it is sold from its present register on to the register of another country and another airline. The right to exemption rests only with the country and operator with which the aeroplane is registered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will furnish the Committee with some of the details of the 11 aircraft that have been taken off the exemption register. The aeroplane from Egypt was destroyed in a crash at Mombasa. Of the two aeroplanes from Lebanon, one has been re-registered in Egypt and the other in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The aircraft from Liberia was re-registered in Venezuela. That from Nigeria was damaged and it was economically invalid to enter into repairs. Of the two aircraft from Zimbabwe, one was re-registered in Swaziland and the other in Liberia.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodward</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A point of clarification immediately arises because the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Ms Jones) led the Committee to believe that those planes no longer existed. From what the Minister says, however, they still very much exist. Will she correct the misapprehension under which her hon. Friend is labouring and accept that many of these aeroplanes are simply being re-registered elsewhere?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was not my understanding of what my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West said that the aircraft were removed from the exempt list because they had been destroyed. I have furnished the reasons for the 11 aircraft being taken off the register. As I said, they have been re-registered in other countries, and with other airlines in many instances. What was possibly behind the question from the hon. Member for Witney—and that of the hon. Member for Lichfield, if I understood him correctly—was whether the relevant aircraft will be able to fly into and out of European Union airports after re-registration. The answer is no, they will not. Once they are removed from the register on which they are afforded the privilege of exemption, it will not be possible to apply for or afford such exemption in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Witney asked whether I had details of other European Union countries' compliance with the directive and whether it had been implemented, but I am in no position to afford him those details. For the purposes of information only, however, the Commission's decision came out on 21 April, and the list was published in the 
	<i>Official Journal</i> in May. It is likely that the relevant information will have been furnished to the appropriate authorities in all European Union countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodward</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is extraordinary that the Minister is able to put the directive before us this afternoon but not to be able to tell us what other member states of the European Union are doing about it. Will the hon. Lady tell the Committee at what point Spain, for instance, would be in breach of European law if it did not implement the measure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That question is not the business of the Committee; our business is the statutory instrument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I trust that it will be in order for me to say to the hon. Member for Witney that I find it more than extraordinary that a member of a party so opposed to closer political union of this country with other member states of the European Union believes that I, or the Government, have responsibility for ensuring that other member states abide by legal agreements. I have no knowledge that they have ever failed so to do. It is becoming depressing that Conservative Members believe it to be their bounden duty to adopt a Europhobic approach at some point during every debate in which the House engages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington also raised the issue of transfers to other registers, I trust that the reply that I have already given has assured him on that point. He and the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire referred to the cannibalisation of parts
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
from aeroplanes. In the main, an exempt plane is taken off the list because it has been destroyed and so is no longer flying, or because it has been transferred to another register and is still flying. Should an aircraft be cannibalised—with an engine being put into another aeroplane, for example—that engine could still contravene the noise requirement for access to and egress from European Union airports. Such movement would, therefore, not be permitted to those aircraft. As I have said, the list of OECD countries accorded the privilege of exemption is closed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for the answer that she gave my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire. She answered me earlier by saying that serial numbers would not change. If an exempted aircraft on the list had an engine that exceeded the dB A allowance, it would be allowed in because it was exempt—its serial number would not have changed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has more than lost me. I thought that I had made abundantly clear that the number of aircraft exempt from the noise regulations applying to all European Union airports is limited. I have referred to 11 aircraft that have come off the list; 56 aeroplanes are still on the list. By March 2002, no aircraft that does not meet the noise requirements of the European Union will be allowed to fly into or out from an EU airport. Therefore, the point that the hon. Gentleman made, as I am sure that he now realises, is absurd—what he suggested could not possibly happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. O'Hara. I hope that the Minister did not say "absurd". My suggestion could not happen after 2002, but it could happen before. The Minister would not wish to mislead the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that that was a point of order. The hon. Gentleman objects to the word "absurd", but it is for the Chair to determine whether that word was in order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know if it is for the Chair to interpret, but the only profitable use that can be made of a dirty engine is for it to be transferred to a plane the serial number of which is on the list. The purpose of the statutory instrument is to remove such planes from the list.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. O'Hara. I am most grateful for your assistance in that matter. I thought that I had made it clear, but obviously I had not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final point made by the hon. Member for Witney was whether these aircraft were exempt on noise-only grounds. The answer is yes—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodward</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may just finish my sentence. As I have already pointed out to the Committee, these are aeroplanes from developing countries that are exempted from the noise regulations applying to all other aircraft at European Union airports. That is the only reason that they are on the exempt list. As I said, these are the first 11 aircraft of a list that comprised 67 to come off that privileged exemption list.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodward</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret that the Minister decided to make Europhobic comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0626">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodward</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not about Europhobia at all. We raised the issue because of a belief in the single market and in making competition work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As under your direction, Mr. O'Hara, we cannot talk about European Union matters but must focus only on the directive, we return to exactly how the timing for this country to implement that directive was arrived at. I simply ask, therefore, on a point of important information, whether the Minister is satisfied with the way in which the chapter 2 phase-out sub-group and the group of experts on the abatement of nuisances caused by air transport work, and what scrutiny they applied to produce these 11 aircraft.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The element of scrutiny is not relevant. The information is, in effect, afforded by the relevant countries when the situation with regard to their exempt aircraft changes. As I said, two of the aircraft were removed from the list because one crashed and the other was in such a state of disrepair that it could not economically be repaired. I presume that the other aircraft that I mentioned have been sold on and re-registered to other countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have answered all the questions that have been put to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. I am sure that she would not want to leave any questions unanswered. I asked about the 97 dBA limit. If that were altered, would it affect future statutory instruments as well as the one that we are discussing today?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. O'Hara—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Deep breath.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A deep breath and extremely slow enunciation, and I shall attempt to use words of a limited number of syllables.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The statutory instrument before us informs the Committee about 11 aircraft which, until the Committee approves the regulations, are on a limited exemption register. It is limited to 67 aircraft and to countries that have been granted the exemption on the advice of the OECD. The exemption relates to the fact that the engines of those aeroplanes do not meet the noise requirements that apply to all other aircraft flying into or out of European Union airports. If the Committee agrees to the regulations, those 11 aircraft will be taken off that exemption list, which means that they will not be able to fly into or out of European Union airports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noise regulations that apply to Gatwick, Heathrow and Stansted are, as I am sure the hon. Member for Lichfield knows, infinitely higher in one sense and could not possibly be broken by these aircraft because they would not be allowed to fly into those airports.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodward</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the things that most worries me about the Minister's patronising tone to my hon. Friend the Member for Lichfield and the extraordinary complacency that she has adopted in answering our questions is that crucial issues are involved. I regret that you, Mr. O'Hara, disallowed us from talking about matters of safety—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is for the Chair to keep the Committee in order. Before the Committee is a statutory instrument called the draft Aeroplane Noise (Amendment) Regulations. I emphasise the words "aeroplane noise".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodward</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am again grateful for your guidance, Mr. O'Hara. I asked questions about CPASG and ANCAT for one important reason. The Minister is responsible today for deleting, through the directive, the operation of some of the planes covered by the exemption list. If, as I suspect, she does not know the background to the scrutiny that occurs, she will have a problem in satisfying herself and the Committee that it was effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have today discovered that two aircraft—Lebanese 707s—are no longer in service but have not been removed from the register. Thirteen planes could be removed from the register today—why are they not being removed? Perhaps the Minister can tell us. If she cannot, I shall be more than happy to furnish her with information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Anything that I can do to worry the hon. Gentleman, I welcome. My only regret is that it is apparently so easy. I am quite sure that the hon. Member for Lichfield has not lost his sense of humour, as the hon. Member for Witney so clearly has. That does pose the question, however, of whether the hon. Member for Witney ever had a sense of humour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked me about aircraft that are still flying. I have been to some pains to quarry out of the hon. Gentleman his actual concerns. The list in the regulations excludes from the exemption list aircraft from developing countries, which, until they are removed from that exemption list, are allowed to contravene the noise regulations applying to all other aircraft flying into and out of European Union airports. The regulations ensure that the specified aircraft will no longer be able to fly into or out of such airports. Some will not be flying into or out of any airport, because they have virtually been destroyed. The others will indeed still be flying, but because they are now registered to other countries they are not on the exemption list and are bound by the noise regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to aircraft from Lebanon. I can offer no opinion on them. Until the hon. Gentleman gives me their registration numbers, I will not know whether they are even on the exemption list. They have clearly not been sold on, and they may be among the 56 aircraft still on the exemption list that fly under this privilege.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I was saying, I believe that I have answered the questions asked thoroughly and fully. I therefore commend the regulations to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodward</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No amount of being patronising or offensive can disguise that the Minister clearly does not know her brief. For that reason, I shall assist her with the information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It went deep.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0627">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodward</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may think that it went deep, but it is clear that she has no deep knowledge of her brief whatever. The reality is that two aircraft, Lebanese 707s, no longer in service, are not being removed from the register because the airlines concerned have not yet replied to Civil Aviation Authority inquiries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The process involved reveals the almost ad hoc nature of the way in which the planes arrive on the list of exemptions. It reveals that there is no sophisticated procedure and that it is in fact somewhat ad hoc. The Minister should look at the way in which CPASG and ANCAT work, as she has again clearly demonstrated that she does not a have clue how they work or how the system of recommending the planes works. I do not blame her for not wanting to admit that she does not know her brief, but we have seen this afternoon, as we did last week that she is simply not up to her brief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not aware that the remark that I made last week had wounded the hon. Gentleman so deeply. He has referred to it time after time, and I regret that I have to open the wound or rub more salt into it. If there is anyone who is incapable of not understanding not only the brief but the topic for debate, it is the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are considering a statutory instrument that removes from an exemption list 11 aircraft which, until now, were permitted to contravene the noise regulations that apply to all other aircraft that wish to fly into or out of European Union airports. Once the Committee agrees to accept the statutory instruments, these nine aircraft—after all, two are no longer flying anywhere—will no longer be allowed to fly into or out of European Union airports.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Witney spoke about the two other Lebanese aircraft. They seem to come off the list if they have been sold out or destroyed, which is fair enough. What happens with other planes when they reach the same position? Will
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
there be a series of statutory instruments that deal with them one by one, or does this set in train an automatic system?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. It is by no means an automatic system. When such aircraft are to be removed from the list, either because they are no longer flying or because they have transferred from the register which at the moment accords an exemption, it will be the responsibility of this House to agree to that list by means of a statutory instrument. So I have little doubt that possibly next year—there are only 56 aircraft left on the list, as I have said—other aircraft will have been removed from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire clearly wishes to intervene.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I wish to come back on this, because, delightful and mature as I find these proceedings, to have another statutory instrument followed by others until the year 2002 would be a degree repetitive. Would it not be possible to devise something in the statutory instrument that allows the aircraft to be removed from the register automatically when the time comes, rather than taking up the time of the Committee on up to three other occasions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The length of time taken to consider any statutory instrument depends upon the Opposition's wish to examine it. I would be the last person to wish to preclude or limit such debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the questions have been answered, and I commend the statutory instrument to the Committee most strongly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
