<br><br><!-- lb -->
The aim of this Amendment is to take all initiatory power to schedule historic houses out of the hands of the local authorities. I do not mean by this any criticism of local authorities. We all know that they are one of the glories of England, and that no other nation can produce such a body of voluntary workers, so efficient and honest. At the same time, the world is not perfect, and nearly everybody has his failings. One of the chief failings of local authorities is a complete lack of artistic sensibility. They look upon these questions entirely from the point of view of the economic prosperity of their towns and the convenience of their inhabitants, and the fact must be faced that very often economic and artistic interests clash. They are almost bound to clash. You get such a state of things as a very ancient house standing out into the street and interfering slightly with the traffic, or you get a narrow street of old houses which might be pulled down and the street widened in order to make a shopping centre. My experience is that in such a situation the local authority will be on the side of economic prosperity and not on the side of historic and artistic interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a particular case of it lately—a glaring case—with regard to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>526</span>
old town house at Dundee. That, I understand, is by far the most important building in Dundee. It was built by the father of Robert Adam and is a building of great artistic importance. Yet the Dundee Town Council, because the building was interfering with the development of the town, proposed to pull it down. A number of other instances of the same type could be given. I have had a production sent to me by the Society for the Preservation of Rural Amenities called "The Threat to the Peak," and in it, among other things, are a large number of criticisms of the Sheffield Town Council showing that they do not use their existing powers to produce by-laws to avert atrocities of various kinds. I do not think any of us blame city councils, town councils, and district councils—they really do not know or care about such things; but it seems a most fantastic thing, that, when we are bringing forward this Bill in order to improve the situation, these very people who have shown themselves particularly incapable of dealing with this aspect of planning be made the arbiters of taste in the matter. It seems a ridiculous thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not the only reason why they are not suitable authorities for this purpose. I think it is true to say that many members of local authorities themselves own land in the districts which are to be town-planned, and though I am certain that their decisions will be come to as far as possible in an unbiased way, it puts them in an impossible position. Take the example, which is not an unfair one, of a town councillor who has bought a small bit of land in the outskirts of his town with a view-to development later on. The town planning scheme is brought in, and this land contains certain old houses which interfere with the scheme of development. I am sure that this councillor will do his best to be unbiased, but it puts him in an intolerable position, and it is contrary to the whole position of this country that people who are interested should be made the judges in a matter of this kind. There is a further objection of a most fundamental kind. There is a provision in the Bill to schedule land in private ownership, but there is no provision to schedule land in public ownership. Very often the only important building in the town is in public ownership, as in Dundee. It may be an
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0265">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>527</span>
old town hall, or a market house, or some Georgian buildings used as local government offices. If the local authority schedule these, well and good, but if they refuse to do it, the Minister has no power to make them. He can modify the schedule, which means that he can take things out if there are protests against it, but there is no initiatory power on the part of the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman may say that the new provision which he foreshadowed last time we met will meet this case. He said that he would introduce a new Clause to allow private 'persons to get into communication with the Minister about the preservation of certain ancient buildings in their areas where the local authority has not acted. That was a concession to the hon. and gallant Member for Salisbury (Major Despencer-Robertson). That does make a certain difference, but it is a very haphazard method, because it will depend entirely on there being somebody else in the district who has better taste than the local authority, and such a person may not always exist. If we are going to deal with this thing, let us do it properly. Therefore it is proposed under this Amendment that the initiatory power should be in the hands of the Minister. I do not propose that it should be in his hands alone, for two reasons. The first is that I do not think the Minister would accept the whole onus of deciding, and the second is because I do not think the Committee would give the Minister such autocratic powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it is proposed in a later Amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Salisbury to set up an advisory committee of experts. I understand that the hon. and gallant Member does not stand by the wording of his Amendment but only by the principle, and if the Minister were willing to accept the principle, my hon. and gallant Friend and those associated with him would be ready to accept any other plan if the right hon. Gentleman thought it more practicable. It is very important, however, that the principle of the advisory committee should be accepted. There is no lack of experts in this country. There are the Office of Works, the National Trust, the Fine Arts Commission, and innumerable people who have not very much to do, and plenty of taste, who would be able
	<span class='label label-info column'>528</span>
to do this work perfectly well. The work they would have to do is not at all heavy. They would deal only with the outside of buildings. All they would have to do would be to take a large scale Ordnance map and mark the buildings which ought to be preserved. There would not be a day's work in any one scheme for the advisory committee, and there will not be so very many schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had some figures sent to me, but as I understand that figures are regarded as misleading, I will not quote them, but even if the figures were multiplied by 10, the advisory committee would not be over-worked. Under the present scheme as it is put forward, the whole arbitrament of taste would be put into the hands of people whom we know are not really fitted to exercise it. They are very good for other jobs, but not for this. It is as though the Committee of Selection were to choose Hobbs to represent England in lawn tennis because he made 100 at Lords against Australia at cricket. They are fitted to do local government, but not this work. As an alternative, we should have, under the proposed Amendment, a committee of the greatest experts, who would be specially fitted to deal with the subject. I cannot believe that the Committee will take any other decision but in favour of this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The MINISTER of HEALTH (Sir Hilton Young)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confess I thought, in view of some of the Amendments put down, that my Noble Friend would have attached less importance to this Amendment than he appears to do, but since he still attaches importance to it, let me deal with it and show that it would not really make a useful addition to the machinery of the Bill. The effect of the Amendment would be to prevent the powers which it is useful to give in respect of the preservation of interesting ancient buildings from a completion which they could receive alone from the Clause in its present form. Of course, I am under none of those illusions which the Noble Lord attributes to some of the advocates of the Bill as to the perfection of local authorities. On the other hand, I do not take such a gloomy view of it as some of my hon. Friends opposite. I know that admirable work has been done by many local authorities in the preservation of the beautiful monuments and ancient
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0266">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>529</span>
buildings which are to be found in their districts, and such exceptions as that to which he has referred, about which I have nothing to say, are undoubtedly exceptions to the common run of the very careful handling of this question by local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Noble Lord wants to secure to the central authority the responsibility of this power of preservation. That is already in existence under the existing provisions of the law relating to ancient monuments as administered by the Commissioners in touch with the Office of Works. There you have the machinery for central initiative. As the Noble Lord rightly says, in the new addition which I propose to Clause 13 you will have the machinery for the initiative on the part of private persons for the preservation of ancient buildings. There is something which you still want, and that is the initiative on the part of local authorities themselves to preserve their ancient buildings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Noble Lord takes a gloomy view of what the local authorities will do. But you must not deprive them of all means of grace. You must not prevent them doing what they can if they want to do it. The Clause gives an opportunity to local authorities to take action for preservation if they wish to do so, under the reasonable control and checks which the Bill provides. The Commissioners of Works desire to see their powers for preservation supplemented by a reasonable extension of the powers of local authorities, and I think that the further Amendment which I am putting down to the Clause will do a great deal to appease the reasonable anxiety of some Members on the subject of ancient buildings. I must not anticipate the question of advisory committees and I will only say at this point that the Minister will always have, not only the general assistance of expert and skilled persons of high taste but also organised assistance, through advisory councils and committees, and voluntary assistance of that sort. In the circumstances I think that this is a useful extension of the powers of the good local authorities and that there is nothing to be feared from the bad authorities, if there be such, and I trust that the Noble Lord will not press his Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Marquess of HARTINGTON</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It affords me infinite satisfaction to be able to agree entirely with my right hon. Friend the Minister on this occasion, but I am exceedingly sorry to find myself for the moment in disagreement with my noble relative—to use what, I believe, is the correct Parliamentary form. It seems to me that his Amendment would make an abominably bad Clause even worse than it is already. His Amendment would still enshrine the principle on which the whole Bill is based, that it is necessary to employ a staff of bureaucrats to preserve owners of property from their own folly. Much of this Bill is based on the remarkable belief that economic efficiency can only be found in district councils, and this Clause rests on the assumption that beauty can only safely be entrusted to bureaucracy. Let us consider for one moment to whom we owe the existence of these buildings which the Clause seeks to preserve. These buildings were not created by Ministers of Health, or district councils, or Offices of Works. They were created by individuals, by free Englishmen, many of them building without architects and according to what seemed to them to be the best plan. These buildings have been preserved to us not by Acts of Parliament but by the loving care of generation after generation of free Englishmen who did not know what a Minister of Health was and who did not, in many cases, know what a district council was. It seems folly to assume that the continued existence of these buildings can best be ensured by entrusting further powers to any form of government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that in many cases these buildings are threatened by modern economic conditions. Those conditions have been produced, to a large extent, precisely by Bills of this kind. If the people who put up these buildings had had to pay £19,000,000 per year for a Ministry of Health, it is unlikely that many of these buildings would ever have come into existence at all. I object very strongly to the whole principle of the Clause. It may be true, as I say, that there is a threat to existing buildings, and the Minister's Amendment undoubtedly would go some way to meet our objection but not the whole way. There is a case of which the Minister, I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0267">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>531</span>
think, has some knowledge which may he mentioned in this connection. A neighbour of mine in the country is the owner of a very large building of historical interest. Modern conditions, he expects, will make it impossible for him to keep a roof on it, and accordingly he is building himself a small house in his park. It would be intolerable, of course, to live right against a mouldering ruin, and he contemplates destroying the building. The state of affairs which makes that necessary is deplorable, but you will only make conditions of that kind worse by saddling local authorities with duties which they are unfitted to perform and creating the large additional machinery contemplated in the Clause which will have to be paid for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My Noble Friend who moved the Amendment said that the task of scheduling ancient buildings would be a very simple one and would be hardly more than a day's work for a local advisory committee. I am a member of the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments, a Commission containing, besides myself, many persons of great eminence and judgment and employing a trained and expert staff. We estimate that the completion of our survey of ancient and historical buildings in England will take us 86 years. That hardly agrees with my noble relative's idea of the simplicity of the task. It is not and cannot be a simple task. The idea that the Ministry should be responsible for all these buildings, and that there should be the machinery contemplated in the Clause for action by local authorities and appeal to the Minister and consultation with the Commissioners of Works and so forth seems to me to be bureaucracy run mad. There would be enough in each case to keep scores of clerks busy for months, and, even with the Minister's Amendment, many thousands of buildings would still be affected. I am glad that the Minister has not accepted the Amendment, but I hope that the Committee will do the drastic thing and reject the whole Clause, because it contains a principle to which a House of Commons pledged to economy ought not to give its consent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. HOROBIN</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The support of the Noble Lord for the Minister of Health seems to be the opposite of the quality
	<span class='label label-info column'>532</span>
of mercy, because it embarrasses him that gives, and I am sure it must be gravely embarrassing also to him that takes. I support the right hon. Gentleman, but for reasons very different from those just expressed. The Minister has already in Clause 8 (1) the powers which it is intended to give him by this Amendment. At the early stage of a scheme the Minister can insist on an authority taking such action as is suggested here if they have not done so. If the authority in the case of a building like a town hall, which ought to be preserved, have taken no action the Minister can refuse to approve of the scheme if they do not do so at a later stage. Under other powers, if the Minister is satisfied that an authority is not taking action which it ought to take, he can, after a local inquiry, insist on the authority doing so. Therefore, I do not think it fair to suggest that the Minister has not ample power to ensure any preservation which he feels ought to be undertaken, in spite of the unwillingness of the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether the Minister in the past has always been as active as he might have been, I do not know, but, if my reading of the Bill is correct, the Minister can insist upon the preservation of buildings which ought to be preserved even though the local authority is not anxious to take steps. If that is a correct reading of the Bill surely the Noble Lord will agree that it is immensely important to enlist, as far as it can be done, such local interest as we can inspire. I hope that the Minister will agree, in principle, to a local tribunal which will give the local authority both advice and encouragement in taking action. But, on the assumption that the Minister has powers, quite apart from the powers of the Commissioners of Works, for taking action over the heads of the local authorities, there is everything to be gained by keeping the Clause in its present form and ensuring that a local authority can be encouraged, bullied or badgered into taking action and that it will not be able to ride off on the excuse that it has no powers, which it could do if the Amendment were carried. I hope that the Amendment will not be pressed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very disappointed at the reception of my Amendment, which does not appear to have pleased either the promoters or the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0268">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>533</span>
opponents of the Bill. There have been speeches on all sides but there has been unanimity on one point only, and that is, that the local authorities are not suitable people to discharge this duty. The Minister said that the local authorities were not perfect, but that they would learn, like everybody else. There are two ways in which they can learn—by being taught and by bitter experience. I do not see any provision in the Bill for teaching local authorities the right thing with regard to ancient monuments, and I therefore conclude that they will have to learn by bitter experience, and it will not be their bitter experience but our bitter experience. We are all agreed, I think, that they are, at any rate, not the most suitable people for this purpose and to put this matter into their hands is, I think, not a progressive but a retrograde step.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last speaker suggested that it was a good thing to put as much initiative as possible into the hands of local authorities and to try and encourage a spirit of artistic interest and so on. If that be so, why was the Ancient Monuments Act passed at all? The idea of that Act was that there were many ancient monuments—more important than those coming under this Bill—which the local people were not competent to deal with and which had to be dealt with by a central authority. It is just the same thing here. These may not be such important buildings but they are historical buildings and they are not a local but a national heritage. The countryside is a national heritage and not the heritage of the Bucks County Council or the Herts County Council. It is only right that these buildings should be dealt with in the same way as the ancient monuments were dealt with under the Ancient Monuments Act, even though they are smaller and perhaps less important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

that and the other, that really life is becoming quite intolerable and that he will not put up with it. But you have to put up with it. The question is how we are to get out of the difficulties in which we are placed. I believe that some sort of control is inevitable now, if these things are to be preserved at all and I am willing to try modified control, and I want the best kind of control which can be got. It is all very well for my Noble Friend to say, "I do not believe in control; I will not have it." You might just as well say about any Bill, "I will not have it, I do not approve of any Government in England having so much power."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The object of this Amendment is to give the same powers to county councils as county boroughs are given under this Clause. County councils are as much interested in the preservation of ancient monuments in their counties as the county boroughs are. My hon. Friend who moved the previous Amendment said that county councils are not really affected, but every county council has a large number of members who have a very great knowledge and take a great interest in the preservation of ancient buildings. There must be no reason why a county council should not be given this authority, and it would be advantageous that it should. The Minister, when he comes to reply, may say it has sufficient power under the Ancient Monuments Acts, but, if that is so, there is more reason for putting county boroughs in the Bill, because county boroughs and county councils have the same powers in that respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel FREMANTLE</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like, 
	<i>prima facie,</i> certainly to support this Amendment because I, like many of us, feel that this Clause is one that creates very great difficulty for those who are trying to get a right balance between private initiative and rights and public initiative and rights. The difficulty, obviously, is that although we might like to draft a definite scheme putting in the right people to decide such things and leaving individuals to do the right thing with their own property, we are face to face with a democratic position in this country and the democracy has got tremendous power. The difficulty between myself and hon. Friends opposite is that we are face to face with a great mass movement which is going out and taking hold of things, although you may wish it were not the case. We have to get the local authorities to try to control this mass movement and it is from that point of view—the educative point of view—that I think power should be given to the local authorities. The Amendment asks to bring in a larger body representing the democracy in the counties, namely, the county council. I do not want to deprive the smaller local authorities, the district and borough councils, of their responsibilities, but there is no doubt that generally there are wider views on the county councils than on the local councils, and where it is a question of art, taste and such like, although the prime duty of local authorities is to preserve the rates, at the same time you have on county councils the, aesthetic view more represented, though still quite inadequately represented. I believe it would be greatly to our advantage to create a proper balance between aesthetic desires and private rights by bringing in the larger authority, the county council, if that could be done consistently with the construction of this Bill. On those grounds, I beg to support the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

After all, the district

councils do know their districts, and they know the feeling and interests of the districts. They know also, to a very large extent better than the county councils, what the associations of the buildings are, and they know local feelings and sentiment. If time permitted—which I know it does not—I could enter into a considerable discussion on the whole merits of county councils. They are bodies hanging between heaven and earth. On the general merits I do not think there is any necessity to bring in the county councils. On practically all district councils there are county councillors.

	<br><blockquote><p>"directing that, without their consent, the building, if it is a dwelling-house, shall not be demolished or, if it is not a dwelling-house, shall neither be altered nor demolished."</p></blockquote>
This is a very substantial alteration which I am proposing in the Clause in order to meet a body of opinion, which has been very clearly and very forcibly expressed, as to what the proper and legitimate content of this Clause should be. I think the first in the field was my Noble Friend who moved the first Amendment to-day and since then there have been opportunities for gauging public opinion on this question, and I have received the impression that the alteration which I am now proposing is necessary in order to bring the scope of the Bill into harmony both with what is right and with general public opinion on the question. As the Bill stood originally, it gave what I call the power for preservation or power to prevent anybody in the case of a building of architectural or historic interest from demolishing or altering that building.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is very forcibly said that that goes too far in respect of inhabited and inhabitable houses, for two reasons; first of all, because it is too much of an interference with the rights of the individual to prevent him from altering a house
	<span class='label label-info column'>538</span>
in which he is living, and, secondly, because it is not necessary in the interests of the community to prevent even the most ancient and historic buildings from being altered. Some of the most interesting historic buildings have been freely altered in the past, and accretions and alterations may have given them so much of their interest and beauty. Both in the interests of beauty and in the interests of the individual, we think there should be a limitation of the power; and the limitation which commends itself to common sense is that you should not be able to step in and demolish a lovely old house, but that you should be able to alter it. The reason is that once you have demolished a thing, it is gone for ever, but alterations can always be put back. Nothing irremediable happens there. I trust that this Amendment will commend itself to the Committee, and that it will be found to cover a number of other criticisms which may be advanced for other Amendments in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Viscount CRANBORNE</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to thank the Minister very much for his valuable concession, which meets, at any rate, my objections in this matter, but, before I actually agree not to oppose the Amendment, I should like to ask the Minister for some information about a later Amendment of his, which is dependent on this one—In page 22, line 11, at the end, to add the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(7) A building shall not, for the purposes of this Section, be deemed to be a dwelling-house by reason only that the building or some part thereof is occupied as a dwelling-house by a person employed as the caretaker thereof or by members of his family."</p></blockquote>
If a house is occupied as a dwelling house, it is a dwelling house, even if it be only occupied by a caretaker or by members of his family. A local authority that happened not to consist, as the Minister says they do, of careful and discreet people, might take advantage of that provision, and forbid any form of alteration. A situation might easily arise in which a house was occupied, not by the owner, but temporarily by a caretaker. I should be very glad if the situation could be further clarified. I understand that, as a result of this Amendment, practically the whole of the other Amendments on page 21 will disappear—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir H. YOUNG</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With regard to the Noble Lord's first point, concerning my Amendment to add a new Sub-section (7), this is a repetition of a provision in the Ancient Monuments Act. It is directed at the ruined castle where a corner of the keep has been converted into a cottage for the caretaker. It is not directed at, and would not apply to, and would not be interpreted as applying to, the inhabitable dwelling house with an old lady living in the basement to keep the rats out while the family are away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. BEAUMONT</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister is right when he says that it would not be interpreted as applying to the case of a ruined castle which he has instanced, but might I ask him what is his authority for saying that? His Amendment explicity states that, if the building is only occupied by a caretaker, it may not be regarded as a dwelling house, and that is a matter of some importance, as to which we want to be absolutely certain that the legal interpretation is beyond all reasonable doubt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir H. YOUNG</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I make that statement on the authority of experience that the provision has existed in the other Act, and has never been interpreted in any other way. The Noble Lord's second point is dealt with in a subsequent consequential Amendment. Paragraph (
	<i>a</i>) becomes unnecessary, and is to be omitted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Major DESPENCER-ROBERTSON</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask the Minister a question about the last few words of Sub-section (1), namely:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and may at any time vary or revoke an Order so made by them."</p></blockquote>
It seems to me that these words take away on the one hand what the Minister has given with the other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir H. YOUNG</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Clause, with the addition of the Amendment which I am now moving, will read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a resolution to prepare or adopt a scheme has taken effect, the council of any county borough or county district which, or any part of which, is situate within the
	<span class='label label-info column'>540</span>
area to which the resolution applies may at any time make an order with respect to any building of special architectural or historic interest within that area and within their borough or district, directing that, without their consent, the building, if it is a dwelling-house, shall not be demolished or, if it is not a dwelling house, shall neither be altered nor demolished, and may at any time vary or revoke, an order so made by them."</p></blockquote>
They may only vary or revoke an Order, or make an Order, within the limited powers which will now be given them. They may not make an Order compelling the alteration of an inhabited dwelling house.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Viscount EDNAM</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think the Minister has made the point clear as regards the ruined castle with a caretaker in the keep. As I understand the present position, if such a building is scheduled under the Ancient Monuments Act the owner has no power to make alterations to that building, but if the building is not so scheduled, the owner at the present time has full power to make whatever alterations he likes. If, however, this Amendment be carried, the owner will in future have no power to make any alteration whatsoever, or, in other words, every such building will, after this Amendment has been carried, be scheduled under the Ancient Monuments Act, and the owner will have no power of alteration whatsoever. [
	<i>Interruption.</i>] That is what the Minister said. I understood him to say that, in the case of a ruined castle with a caretaker in the keep, the owner will, under this Amendment, have no power to make any alteration. I should like it to be made quite clear whether, if this Amendment is carried, the owner will have power to make whatever alterations, or even demolitions, he likes, in the case of a ruined castle which is partly occupied by a caretaker in the keep.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir H. YOUNG</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nothing in the Measure which we are now passing will in any way effect any of the powers of the Ancient Monuments Act, and anything scheduled as an ancient monument will be preserved under this Measure just as it is preserved now. This provision will give to the planning authority, and, as we have now said, to the county council, power, under the safeguards and controls provided, to make an Order in respect of,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0272">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>541</span>
say, a ruined castle, which will have the effect of preventing that castle from being demolished or altered, subject to the safeguards of the Act. Now we have said that an inhabited house is to be free from that control, so that it may be altered, though it may not be demolished. All that is said by the words about which my Noble Friend the Member for South Dorset (Viscount Cranborne) raised a question is that you are not, by way of a kind of legal fiction, to pretend that a castle is an inhabited house by tucking a caretaker into the corner of the bottom of the keep.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Viscount EDNAM</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what I object to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir H. YOUNG</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have not come to that Amendment yet, anyhow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Viscount EDNAM</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Committee will insist on resisting that point. I cannot see why an owner should be refused the right to alter, say, a building that has been partially burnt out. I am the owner of a building in which my family lived up to the year 1640. It was then destroyed by fire, but it is inhabited by a caretaker and is very carefully preserved, and at the present time my family have the right to alter it, in just the same way as they have the right to alter the house in which we actually live. I cannot see why we should be refused, as we shall be, if that building comes within the scope of a town planning scheme, the right to alter that particular family building, when we are not refused the right to alter the other family building, which will be scheduled as an inhabitable dwelling, but in which, possibly, we may not be able to live in the future. I hope that the Minister will make that point clear. I think that the same thing applies to the point raised by my Noble Friend the Member for South Dorset (Viscount Cranborne).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir H. YOUNG</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the Noble Lord that his fears on this subject are unfounded. Perhaps I might point out, if we may discuss the matter now—and it is quite convenient to do so—that my later Amendment says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A building shall not for the purposes of this Section be deemed to be a dwelling house by reason only that the building or some part thereof is occupied as a dwelling house …"</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>542</span>
That does not affect the question whether the building is a dwelling house or not. The building to which the Noble Lord has referred is, as I understand it, a dwelling house, and will continue to be a dwelling house. The Amendment only says that, if a building is not a dwelling house—and a castle that has been a ruin since the days of William Rufus is admittedly not a dwelling house—it is not to be made such by a kind of trick, as it were, by putting a caretaker into the building. You could not make Stonehenge a dwelling house by building a shanty against one of the uprights. If a building is a dwelling house, it does not, under this Amendment, cease to be a dwelling house because you put a caretaker into it. The building to which the Noble Lord refers is a dwelling house.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Viscount EDNAM</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No one has lived there except a caretaker since 1640, and, as far as I can see, it will no longer be a dwelling house if the Minister's Amendment is passed. If he can assure me that that castle will remain a dwelling house by virtue of the fact that it has had a caretaker in it for the last 100 years or so, I shall be satisfied, but if a town planning authority is to be given power to say, if it comes within the radius of a town planning scheme, that it cannot be scheduled as a dwelling house, and therefore we shall have no right to alter it, I shall resist the Amendment as much as I can. I do not think, however, that the Minister has made the point clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Marquess of HARTINGTON</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's Amendment goes a considerable way towards meeting the objections of those people who still have some regard for liberty—of whom there are not many—but I suggest that he would meet the view of my Noble Friend and others if he would incorporate in his Amendment the words of the later Amendment which stands in the names of my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for South Leicester (Captain Waterhouse) and myself—In page 20, line 14, at the end, to insert the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that nothing in this Section shall prevent an owner of an inhabited house or of a house capable of general habitation from carrying out on such house or on any buildings attached thereto any alterations or demolitions desirable with a view to habitation."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0273">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>543</span>
That Amendment, of course, will otherwise fall to the ground. I think my right hon. Friend will agree that the Clause as it stands might operate to prevent the owner of a house from restoring it so as to make it capable of habitation. Probably he knows Haddon Hall, one of the most beautiful houses in England. It had been a ruin for a very long time, and certainly it would not have been a dwelling house within the meaning of this Measure, particularly if the words of the Minister's later Amendment had been the law. The owner, however, has this year carried out most amazingly successful repairs to his house, and has converted what was a beautiful ruin into one of the most beautiful habitable dwelling houses in the world. He would, however, have been tied at every turn by the local authority, and could have made no alterations without their consent, certainly not so far as the exterior was concerned, if this Bill had been the law, even with the Amendment of the Minister. There was not even an actual caretaker in the house but only in a cottage some little distance away. I think that the Minister will probably agree, as he has gone so far, that it is extremely undesirable to tie the owner's hands unnecessarily; and to insert the words of my Amendment in his Amendment would meet that difficulty to some extent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. BEAUMONT</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I urge the Minister to adopt that suggestion, if it be possible. I want to put a further case in which, I think, his intention might be defeated by the words as they stand. Suppose that a dwelling house is destroyed by fire and the shell is left. Owing to various Clauses, such as the decrease in property values which will follow as the result of this Measure, the family may not be able to restore it for a period of years. During that period, the planning authority schedule it as a non-habitable dwelling which cannot be altered. That means that it cannot without their consent and approval be restored. I do not think that the Minister means that, but it is possible under his Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir H. YOUNG</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My impression is that our minds are at one in this, and that we desire to achieve the same ends. I am advised that on a legal interpretation the expression "or of a house capable
	<span class='label label-info column'>544</span>
of general habitation "would be more restrictive than my own phraseology" a dwelling-house." "A house capable of general habitation" would be considered as a house now capable of habitation, whereas "a dwelling-house" means a house that has been a dwelling-house, and is by implication capable of being a dwelling-house again. So in the interest of the point which has been taken by the Noble Lord, that suggestion should not be pressed, but I shall be willing to consider the phraseology "a dwelling-house" before the further stages of the Bill to see whether it includes all the classes of residence which the Committee desire to include.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Viscount EDNAM</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the Minister to give an assurance that the phraseology will be such that such a case as that mentioned by my Noble Friend—Haddon Hall, for instance—will not be impaired, that is to say, that the owner will have exactly the same powers in future as he had in the past in the case of a ruined building should he desire to go and live there and repair it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. HOROBIN</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There seems to be general agreement in this matter, but I want to take a new point in regard to the wording in the Amendment where it does not seem to carry out the intention which we all have. We have been speaking of changes in dwelling-houses which are solely dwelling-houses, which are being altered so that they will remain solely dwelling-houses, but that is not the effect of the Amendment. We have to consider the attempt to alter a dwelling-house in order to make it something else, as, for instance, to turn it into a shop, or to turn part of it into a shop which can be lived over. We are concentrating too much on Haddon Hall and not enough on smaller but equally precious buildings, such as an old farmhouse which has been built round owing to the spreading of a town. It might be changed into a shop or into a garage, and I imagine that such changes and alterations are in nobody's mind. Nobody desires that that should take place in a house which 
	<i>ex hypothesi</i> was subject to a preservation order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that the Minister should consider a change of wording which would ensure that exemption should apply only to houses which were dwelling houses
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0274">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>545</span>
and nothing else, and should not apply where a dwelling house was being altered in order to turn it into something else. Under this Amendment you can only stop a man demolishing a dwelling house, but if he is going to alter it and turn it partly into a shop or totally alter its character, you cannot stop him. That is not the intention, and it is exceedingly dangerous. I ask the Minister to consider whether even in cases where alterations are being made, which under this Amendment cannot be prevented, that—if, as I hope, my Noble Friend's Amendment to set up an advisory committee is accepted—such alterations should be referred for a report to the committee and should not take place until a certain period has elapsed. Here, again, we are not concerned with alterations that might take place at such a building as Haddon Hall, but with the small and precious farm houses, cottages and similar buildings which may be altered with disastrous results.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Captain WATERHOUSE</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to associate myself with the expression of gratitude to the Minister for accepting the principle underlying our Amendment. I agree that we are at one on this point, but in this particular case our drafting is at least as good as his, because we had the case of the hon. Gentleman in mind when we put in the last words of our Amendment with regard to "any alterations or demolitions desirable with a view to habitation." That would deal with the possibility of pulling about a beautiful old timber house and turning it into an ugly shop. The Minister on consideration may find that our words are more applicable to this case than his, for his words introduce a rather new possibility which, I think, our words avoid. Under the Minister's Amendment, would the pulling down of a redundant wing of a building be considered a demolition or not? Take, again, the case quoted by my Noble Friend of a neighbour of his in Nottinghamshire who was building a house in a park not far from another large house. If he is not to be allowed to demolish that house, what has the Minister got in his mind? Are his heirs to be made to keep it for all time, possibly with a staff of 40 or 50 servants and dependants so as to keep the roof on, or is he to sell it to be turned into an asylum, and thereby completely ruin the
	<span class='label label-info column'>546</span>
amenities of the house which he has built within a short distance?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir H. YOUNG</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Noble Lord the Member for Wednesbury (Viscount Ednam) will understand that it will be improper for me to give any undertaking as to the application of the law to a particular case. I could not do that, because it would be anticipating a decision that would have to be given in a judicial or semi-judicial capacity, but the intention is that which we have arrived at in the discussion this morning, and I will consider the wording to see whether it carries out that intention. With regard to the point of the hon. Member for Central Southwark (Mr. Horobin), the Noble Lord is quite right that the phrase in his Amendment is very relevant to the point made by the hon. Member, and I will consider before the further stage whether it is desirable to incorporate some words of that sort in order to carry it out. I should like to look at the whole phrasing of the Clause. As to demolition, the hon. Member will remember that every order under this Clause is subject to the absolute right of compensation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Captain WATERHOUSE</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: How can you compensate for keeping up a building such as we have in mind?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir H. YOUNG</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not for me to say; that is for whatever tribunal assesses the compensation. If the compensation involves the maintenance of the building, and the maintenance is great, the compensation in consequence will have to be great, and the compensation might be so great that no local authority could contemplate making the order. That is the protection. In the imperfect world in which we live, there will be tragic cases in which it will be impossible to preserve the nation's historic treasures in the way of buildings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Captain WATERHOUSE</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister rightly said that the compensation order under Clause 17 was inalienable. In those cases will he consider on the appropriate stage making Clause 17 apply to paragraphs (
	<i>b</i>) and (
	<i>c</i>) and not to paragraph (
	<i>a</i>) of Clause 18, which is covered by Clause 19?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel SANDEMAN-ALLEN</div> <!-- member -->

	<span class='label label-info column'>547</span>
be a strong division of opinion in a case like that as to whether the alterations would be an improvement, and the position might easily arise under the present wording that an owner would not be permitted to make the alterations such as were made at Haddon Hall, and which are now admitted to be an improvement. There might be a strong division of opinion, and the owner might be overridden. I ask the Minister to see that that point of view is considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. TRAIN</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that the Minister is going to consider the Amendment of my hon. Friends along with his own Amendment. His Amendment goes a long way when it says that a dwelling-house shall not be demolished. I should like to see part of the Amendment of my Noble Friend added so that power would be given to make alterations with a view to habitation. We have head a lot about the old castle with the caretaker. I have a case of my own of an old cottage. The tramway company had a provisional order to widen the road in order to run the trams to the satisfaction of the county council, but fortunately they had not compulsory powers. Representations were made to me by admirers of Gilmour of Mongolia, a famous missionary, who was born in that cottage, that if the road were widened the cottage would have to come down. The cottage was hardly habitable, although it was inhabited by a woman of 30. I managed to resist the tramway company and preserved the cottage. When the old woman died, we had it repaired, a new thatch being put on and a sound floor being put in, and one of my own workers is now living in it. A great number of people go to see the place where Gilmour was born.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many cottages of that kind all over Scotland and England. There is Burns' cottage and the place where Livingstone was born. These have all been altered so that people can live in them. On that account alone I plead with the Minister to provide that alterations can be made to buildings of that character which, although they may not be architecturally beautiful, may have sentimental interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Amendment agreed to.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Major DESPENCER-ROBERTSON</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 20, line 24, at the end, to insert the words:
	<span class='label label-info column'>548</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"and Shall if requested by the owner so to do refer the matter to an advisory committee for the purposes of this Section for their advice."</p></blockquote>
The object of this Amendment and a consequential Amendment which appears later on the Paper is to provide for a voluntary committee which shall determine any differences arising between a local authority and an owner as to whether a building of special architectural or historical interest should be altered or demolished, or how the alteration should be made. It seems to me that the most important part of the Amendment is indicated by those words "or how the alteration should be made." We have heard a great deal about the artistic merits of rural district councils and county councils and it is common knowledge that with the best will in the world, some of these local authorities cannot be expected to know how a suitable alteration should be made to buildings of historical or architectural interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed many people who have, perhaps, higher education than local authorities, make blunders in this respect. One has only to look at the picture page of yesterday's "Times" to see what can be done by people who have presumably the best intentions in the world. For the new Memorial Theatre at Stratford-on-Avon they have erected something which looks like a factory and which is as much out of keeping with the beautiful surroundings of Stratford-on-Avon as anything could well be. I hope that in order to prevent anything like that happening in connection with this Measure, the Minister will consider this proposal for an advisory committee. There are plenty of precedents for it. The proposal is founded on the Bath Clause which the Minister knows of, and a similar committee was provided for in the Chester Corporation Act, while there is a more recent precedent in a Surrey County Council Act of last year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. E. BROWN</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. and gallant Member is under a misconception with regard to the Bath Clause. That was devised for the control of the elevations of new buildings and not for buildings of this kind. Clause 17 already provides that the Minister shall act in consultation with the Commissioners of Works which, in practice, means agreement with them, and I think that the hon.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0276">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>549</span>
and gallant Member on reflection will agree that that is the right course. The Commissioners already deal with buildings under the Ancient Monuments Act and have a special staff for the purpose. The work under Clause 17 will be similar and will have nothing in common with the control of the elevation of new buildings. That is the purpose for which the Bath Clause provides an advisory committee—a committee which does useful work in that direction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Brigadier-General CLIFTON BROWN</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is all very well to say that the Minister is going to act in conjunction with the Commissioners of Works, but the Amendment deals with the case in which there is a dispute between an owner and a local authority. An owner may have spent a good deal of money on a building. A local council then takes it over and does not agree with the owner's ideas of altering the building. Surely there should be some means of dealing with any dispute of that kind. It can be done without setting up a new body. It is exactly like a dispute between landlord and tenant in which each party values the holding and the matter is referred to an umpire in the case of a dispute. In these cases, it ought to be possible, before the matter goes to the Minister, to call in an umpire or one of these bodies already formed, to justify either the owner's opinion or the local council's opinion. Having regard to the amount of money which private owners spend on doing what they regard as the best thing in connection with these buildings, they ought not to be interfered with by some local council who may have other motives, and who certainly have not the education, knowledge and study of the private owner, putting in their oar.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. E. BROWN</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the point of the hon. and gallant Member, but this Amendment does not provide what he is arguing for. It only provides an advisory committee.

I apologise for not having this Amendment on the Order Paper, but I was surprised by the early rising of the House last night, and failed to present it in time. The effect of the Amendment will be to leave out the provision for an appeal against a decision of a local authority by 50 local government electors. I am a very convinced democrat and all that; but it seems to me that this provision allows 50 local government electors more power to interfere with other people's business than it is necessary for them to have. In practice, it really means that any one local government elector can take this action. If the Parliamentary Secretary had ever been at the Home Office he would be familiar with appeals for reprieves and the manner in which many thousands of signatures can be collected without any difficulty. It is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0277">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>551</span>
easy to collect signatures; people just ask "Is there any subscription?" and when they are told "no" the signatures can be obtained without any difficulty. This provision would mean that any individual crank in a district would have unnecessary powers of interference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand the procedure under the Bill an owner is compelled to consult the local authority before doing certain things. The owner has power to make representation to the local authority who may if they think fit agree with him and it seems to me that that goes far enough. I do not think it is necessary or desirable that 50 electors should have the power to reopen the whole matter by an appeal to the Minister. My right hon. Friend the Minister is optimistic about the effect of this Bill on local expenditure. I remain convinced that it will lead to a large extension of bureaucracy and of the expense to which ratepayers are put. These things are not done for nothing. It is possible that in the first year or even the first two or three years of the Measure's operation there would not be much increased expenditure, but, eventually, there will be additional expense. I do not know what municipal experience, if any, my right hon. Friend the Minister has had. I do not know if he has served an apprenticeship in local government as many of us on this side have done; but it is the experience of almost everyone who has been connected with local Government that while expenditure may not necessarily go up by leaps and hounds, yet, when once you appoint an official with a particular duty or a particular set of duties, that single official tends inevitably to start a department and that department tends steadily to increase in size.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The growth in the number of officials in municipalities has been, in recent years, absolutely staggering, and is becoming a burden which the country is scarcely able to bear. Under the Bill there may not be an enormous additional burden but there will be an additional burden. All this machinery and correspondence between the local authority, the Minister and the Commissioners of Works tend to increase a burden which is already excessive and intolerable. If one tries to cut down expenditure on a local authority, and if one inquires how
	<span class='label label-info column'>552</span>
it is that a certain department is employing eight clerks where formerly it only employed six, or why a department is costing £20,000 where it formerly cost £15,000, the answer invariably is "We have tried to keep it down, but the correspondence with the Minister makes this increase necessary and unavoidable." One finds that that is the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been an enormous growth in local rates due almost entirely to Ministerial requirements, and hon. Members who have not served on local bodies have no idea of the amount of officialism and of coming and going and corresponding and visits of inspectors and inquiries which can take place. A local authority with which I was associated, made a small road widening which was interfered with by a telegraph post. My right hon. Friend will hardly credit it, but before that pole was removed there had been 22 visits by officials of the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Transport, the Post Office and other authorities, and a volume of correspondence had passed which, I guarantee, could not have been carried in a wheelbarrow. That is the way in which the ratepayers' money goes. I reserve my right to oppose the whole of this Clause which I believe is a bad Clause, but I oppose this provision because it simply gives an opportunity for a certain amount of correspondence which will be largely useless, and will impose trouble and expense on owners of buildings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. BEAUMONT</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to add my plea to the Minister to accept this Amendment, particularly for the reasons which my Noble Friend so convincingly gave. The hon. Member for South Dorset (Viscount Cranborne) spoke of us as convinced democrats. If by that he means that we want to reverse the policy which brought us from being the richest country to the verge of ruin he is right, and we are proud of it. It is just the extra vast expenditure which meant nothing at the time, but which piled up and has become such an appalling drain on the country's resources. I do suggest that in this particular case there is no conceivable reason for this provision. The question of dealing with these special ancient buildings is surely a matter between the local authority and the owner. Why one crank should be permitted to put in his oar after the Minister and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0278">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>553</span>
the local authorities and the owner have threshed it out between them, I cannot conceive. I do not like this Bill and I hate this Clause, but if we are going to have it, let us have it with as little expense and fuss and worry as possible. For those reasons, I beg the Minister to accept the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Captain GUNSTON</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to ask the Minister to explain why it is necessary to have these words which the Noble Lord wants to delete. I confess that the Noble Lord the Member for West Derbyshire (Marquess of Hartington) has rather carried me with him this morning. I should have thought the local authority, when the inquiry was held, would not make an order unless it had good reason, and if it made an order it would probably be quite competent to put that order before the Minister. I cannot see why it is necessary to bring in another body. The local authority may have made a mistake and may be rather pleased to have it put right. They may not be able to do so because one of these bodies of cranks may be gingering them up the whole time. I hope the Minister will enlighten the Committee as to why it is necessary to put these words in at all. I hope he can satisfy us on that point, because many of us have been rather alarmed by this intrusion of further crankism into this Measure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir H. YOUNG</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will answer the hon. and gallant Member for Thornbury (Captain Gunston) in a word. The provision is not necessary. It is a very useful provision for dealing with matters of this sort, but obviously not part of the necessary structure of this Clause. I confess I did not guess what large, issues depended on these words until I heard the speech of the Noble Lord. But, seriously, the Clause was brought in as a useful piece of machinery to be a safeguard upon the deficiencies of local authorities in the matter of the discharge of their aesthetic duties. However, if it is not considered necessary or desirable as a safeguard, I see no objection to its omission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lieut.-Colonel FREMANTLE</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether that means that the right hon. Gentleman accepts the Amendment, but I note this extraordinary appeal by the Noble Lord opposite for bureaucracy
	<span class='label label-info column'>554</span>
Speaking as an old official for many years of a county council, there is nothing I should dislike more than that my recommendations to that body should be liable to be upset by an outside body of experts. To that extent I should be entirely in favour of the Noble Lord's proposal. All the proposals that have been made and all that has been said regarding local authorities not being elected from the point of view of their aesthetic qualifications are directly the antithesis of what the Noble Lord proposes now. I recognise that there is a large number of these local bodies which, as the hon. and gallant Member for Thornbury (Captain Gunston) says, are composed of cranks. Those are bodies with which I do not associate, but there are a large number of bodies like that who are naturally concerned with the aesthetic, historical and architectural amenities of the places. I will give an instance in my own particular area, the suburb of Barnet, where you have urban and rural district councils and the Hertfordshire County Council all interested in preserving amenities, and the main people who are keen about preserving amenities have formed themselves into the Barnet Records Society. These are the kind of people who hold exhibitions, but they are not cranks. They do not get on to public bodies. Those who are afraid, and rightly afraid, of bureaucracy should give an opportunity, in cases where you have a district council not interested in the amenities, for those interested in the amenities to make their protest or make an appeal. I do not think it is of great importance, but I share with my Noble Friend the Member for West Derbyshire (Marquess of Hartington) the intense dislike of this Clause or the need for this Clause. But as there is this need, I do not share his apprehension, and if he is trying to diminish bureaucracy there is a very good reason made out for the refusal of this Amendment. I hope the Minister of Health will not consider withdrawing what is quite a useful though minor point put into the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Further Amendment made: In page 21. line 12, leave out paragraph (

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 21, line 17, to leave out from the word "building" to the end of the Sub-section.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of these words is to limit very substantially the power given in the preceding Amendment. Where a person proposes to take measures which substantially interfere with the external appearance of a building, the local authority can control his actions just as if these words were not on the Paper. I believe that this gives these bodies excessive power of interfering with the action of the individual. We owe the preservation of these buildings to the care of generation after generation of free men, and the fact that they are threatened to-day is due very largely to excessive expenditure by the Government and local authorities. An hon. Member said that I live in the past and that something must be done. "Something must be done" is the excuse where you cannot find any valid argument for doing something and is almost invariably the precursor of doing something very foolish. Even assuming that something must be done, let us make sure it is not the wrong thing. It seems to me that this gives local authorities very large power and it is a quack remedy. My right hon. Friend in another department of his work has a good deal to do with quack remedies, and he knows what dangerous things they are. They deal with symptoms and not with the cause of the disease—putting an ointment on a cancer or something of that sort. It may make the patient a little easier for a time, but the disease goes on unchecked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To give this power to local authorities would cost a very great deal of money, and to that extent would only aggravate the disease. I believe that this power of interfering with the individual's rights should not be granted. Individuals have made mistakes in the past, and many a beautiful building has been ruined by the mistaken zeal of some owner who has restored it. But I believe that, on the whole, these matters are better left to the individual, unhampered, than to the local authority. One effect of this Clause is likely to be that people will have so much trouble in getting the thing agreed to, that they will hesitate to do anything at all.
	<span class='label label-info column'>556</span>
I do not know what my right hon. Friend's view will be, but I am inclined to think that this Clause, and especially the words which I am moving to leave out, will actually make it more probable that the local authority will take action than if paragraph (
	<i>b</i>) of Sub-section (4) were not there. It might be that a local authority who had not scheduled some building would be moved to act when their attention was called to it. I regard this provision as a bad one, but the deletion of these words would substantially improve it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. HOPKINSON</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: These words involve a practical difficulty which constitutes a good reason for supporting the Amendment. The Clause provides for the case:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where any person proposes to take any measures … which involve any substantial interference with its structure or any material alteration in its outward appearance."</p></blockquote>
In practice, it is the individual himself who is going to be the judge as to whether what he proposes materially alters the structure of the building or its outward appearance, and presumably it is only after he has actually done the thing that the functions of the Town Planning Committee arise, and the whole work may have to be undone. Surely, these words complicate the whole business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Viscount CRANBORNE</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in the happy position of being able strongly to support my Noble Friend in regard to this Amendment. I consider that these words serve no useful purpose, and are a direct contradiction of the Amendment which the right hon. Gentleman has already given us. Under his Amendment it is obvious that, if you are living in a dwelling house and do not wish to demolish it, but only to alter it, you do not have to apply to the local council. But, if these words are retained, the Clause will provide that, where any person proposes to take any measures for the protection, preservation or maintenance of a building with respect to which an order under this Section is in force, he will have to give the council notice in writing. [
	<i>Interruption.</i>] I shall be very glad if the right hon. Gentleman will clear up that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir H. YOUNG</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me clear up that misconception. The words with which we
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0280">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>557</span>
are dealing will impair to no extent whatever what I may refer to as the concession which has been made in this Clause. An Order cannot be made to prevent alterations to a dwelling house, so that no Order could cover the field in question, and the provision as to what is to be done in respect of matters which are covered by an Order cannot apply here at all. Let me reassure the Noble Lord on that point. The Amendment has only been handed to me in writing, and I have not had very much time to consider it, but, as I understand the Noble Lord's description of its purport, it is really misconceived, and the dangers that he fears are imaginary. This is a Sub-section in favour of the owner or occupier. It gives him the right to take proper measures for the protection, preservation or maintenance of a building in spite of an Order covering that building. The words which the Noble Lord desires to delete merely say that, when the person affected is going to take such measures in connection with a building covered by an Order, he has to give notice to the authority that made the order, and it reserves power to the authority, in effect, to stop him if what he proposes to do is not 
	<i>bona fide.</i> Its whole effect is to give the local authority the right to make sure that any order they have made is not abused by the doing of work which is not 
	<i>bona fide</i>—that is merely my own word, which I use to show what the provision means. This is simply necessary machinery to carry out the concession which, under the Sub-section, is made to the owner. In these circumstances, we cannot leave out the words, because by doing so we should leave an imperfect administrative machine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. BEAUMONT</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may respectfully say so, I think the Minister does not quite realise the effect that these words may have. As in the case of many other things in the Bill, there is a danger that they may have an effect, exactly contrary to the intention of the Clause, and may, indeed, lead to the destruction of ancient buildings rather than to their preservation. I agree with my Noble Friend that this Clause, like the whole Bill, is a quack remedy, because it does not remove the cause, and these words may largely accelerate the cause of the destruction, removal, or spoliation of ancient buildings. The question is an economic one—
	<span class='label label-info column'>558</span>
one of expense. It often happens that the owner of an ancient building or monument that should be preserved cannot preserve or alter it because he has not the money, or, if he has the money, can only do it in an inefficient way. If the alteration is going to be subject to criticism and veto by the local authority, there will be a still greater inducement to him to say that he cannot afford it and that it involves too much trouble, and then the building will fall down and disappear. While owners pay taxes on these buildings and are responsible for them, they cannot be forced to maintain them. As long as private ownership exists and is taxed in this country, you cannot insist that these buildings belong to the State and not to the private owner, and if it is going to be made too hard for him—and it is hard enough now—to preserve these buildings, which are not a source of profit to him, but which he keeps on merely as a labour of love, I suggest that these words may very well have the effect of destroying many ancient buildings which would otherwise be preserved, and I would ask the Minister seriously to consider that aspect of the question between now and a further stage of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Captain GUNSTON</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that my hon. Friends opposite are right up to a point, but they are apt to forget that these ancient buildings are not always in the hands of people who love them and wish to preserve them. I have in mind an old building which belonged to an old family who had to sell out owing to economic pressure, and which was bought by a man who has pulled it about and converted it into several dwelling houses, thus ruining one of the most beautiful buildings than I know. I think I am right in gathering from the Minister that, unless these words are retained, it would be possible for anyone to buy an old building and, under the pretence that they were preserving it, alter its whole character and ruin it. I understand that these words provide a safeguard against that sort of thing, and, if that be so, it seems to me that it is vital to the purpose of hon. Members opposite that these words should be retained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Marquess of HARTINGTON</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is true that inhabited dwelling houses have been excluded, and only their demolition is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1931-1932V000P0I0281">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>559</span>
being prohibited, but such buildings as a ruined or semi-ruined castle, or an interesting mediaeval dovecot, or a beautiful old tithe barn, would still come within the scope of this Clause, and the owner, by paragraph (
	<i>b</i>) of Sub-section (4), is allowed to take proper measures for the protection, preservation and maintenance of such a building. Suppose that he finds that it is beginning to fall down and needs repair. Then, unless the work is extremely urgent, he is compelled, under this Clause, to go to the local authority, who, as I understand the Clause, has the power to withhold its consent, so that in point of fact it may be the local authority, and not the owner, who has the power to say what are the proper measures for the preservation or maintenance of an ancient building of this kind. I agree that there is a case for this safeguard. One knows of the most horrible cases of corrugated iron roofs being put on beautiful tithe barns—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. HOPKINSON</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I point out to the Noble Lord that Clause 12, with his consent, was allowed to go through in such a way that any agriculturist can do whatever he likes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Marquess of HARTINGTON</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it will be found that very few ancient tithe barns in this country are actually used as barns. They are used as garages, squash courts, assembly rooms, village halls, and so on, but it is comparatively seldom that they are used as agricultural buildings in such a way as to exempt them from the operation of the Measure. If this provision is only going to stop someone demolishing a building under the guise of preserving it, I should not object so strongly, but I think my reading is correct, and that the words which I propose to leave out would give to the local authority the power to dictate to any individual what works of maintenance he shall carry out on his own property.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir H. YOUNG</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can reassure the Noble Lord on that point. I am sure that the interpretation which I put on the Bill is the right one, and the only possible one. The right to take proper measures for the protection, preservation and maintenance of a building is secured by the Bill, and all that the Sub-section which we are now considering does is to secure
	<span class='label label-info column'>560</span>
to the local authority the opportunity of seeing that that right is not merely abused by the doing of something which is not a proper measure for the protection, preservation and maintenance of the buildings. The right is absolute, and is preserved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. HOPKINSON</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is obvious that, under this part of the Clause, the initiative must come from the owner. The owner who proposes to do something has to give notice in writing in certain circumstances, and the ball does not start rolling unless the owner takes these steps. But the owner is also the judge as to whether what he is going to do comes within the scope of this paragraph or not. An owner may say, "What I am going to do does not really involve any substantial interference with the structure or outward appearance of the building and, therefore, I shall not give notice," and the provision becomes completely useless so far as concerns any protection of the amenities of the district. If these words must be retained, would it not be possible so to alter them that the man who has to initiate the whole business shall not be the judge as to whether what he is doing is against the public interest or not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It is obvious that the words will not do, because if it were thought necessary to do this, there would have to be some machinery, but it does not provide any machinery for settlement in case of dispute. The hon. and gallant Member will appreciate that under the Clause, if the work be urgently necessary, it can be done. It is unlikely, therefore, that additional expenditure would occur.

Friend the Member for West Derbyshire (Marquess of Hartington) wishes to say a few words on this Clause, but he does not want to keep the Committee long. He has been called away now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. BEAUMONT</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I add my appeal to the Minister to let us adjourn now I This Clause is of great substance. We have tried to be as brief as we can this morning. We know that we cannot compel the Minister, but it would be a great concession if he would allow my Noble Friend, who attaches great importance to it, the opportunity of speaking on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir H. YOUNG</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This gives me the opportunity of saying what I had in mind to say about the future progress of the Blil. The Committee will recognise that the question of time is becoming a matter of serious consideration in the conduct of this Measure. It is fully recognised that ample opportunities for the discussion of the Measure are required, and
	<span class='label label-info column'>564</span>
indeed have been provided, but we must recognise that before very long it will be a question for grave consideration as to what can be done in order to provide for the Committee those ample opportunities for the discussion of the Bill which the Committee undoubtedly desires. On this particular occasion, if there be more than one Member who desires to discuss the Clause, I shall be by no means prepared to ask the Committee to come to a precipitate conclusion in the absence of Members who have taken a particular interest in the Bill. I will, therefore, consent to the adjournment of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>The Committee adjourned at Five Minutes after One o'Clock, until Thursday, 14th April, at Eleven o'Clock.</p>
