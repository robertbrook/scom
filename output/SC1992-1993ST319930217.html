	<p>[SIR JAMES KILFEDDER 
	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>

	<div class='debates'>

	<section>

	<div class='legislation'>Licensed Betting Offices (Amendment) Scotland Regulations 1993</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Licensed Betting Offices (Amendment) Scotland Regulations 1993 (S.I. 1993, No. 68).—[
	<i>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William McKelvey 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kilmarnock and Loudoun)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. Perhaps I may refer you to Standing Order No. 86(2)(1) which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(i) for the consideration of any public bill certified by Mr. Speaker as relating exclusively to Scotland or of a public bill (or part of a public bill) ordered to be considered by a Scottish standing committee, the committee shall be so constituted as to include not fewer than sixteen Members representing Scottish constituencies;"</p></blockquote>
Having seen the representation on the Committee, I am astonished that, of the hon. Members on the Conservative Benches, only one holds a seat in Scotland and the rest are Anglos who, whatever their interest in racing, could not argue that they represent Scottish seats.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Forman 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carshalton and Wallington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir James. Perhaps through you I may gently point out to the hon. Gentleman that it is a well-known fact to those who have an interest in these matters that I have several distinguished Scottish constituents who closely follow Scottish affairs and who would be keen that I should be a member of such an important Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to say that the composition of the committee has nothing to do with the Chair. The Standing Order to which the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Mr. McKelvey) referred concerns membership of Committees considering public Bills, and not matters of this kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. As you will know, under Standing Orders hon. Members who are not listed to attend a Committee can do so because of the enlightened rules in this unitary Parliament of ours. Therefore, I trust that you will agree that my being here is in order, even though I am not listed as officially required to attend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member does not appear to be out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John McFall 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dumbarton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir James. I refer to your last answer. Standing Order No. 86 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Committee of Selection shall nominate not fewer than sixteen nor more than fifty Members to serve on each standing committee
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
for the consideration of each bill allocated or referred to it, or for the consideration of statutory instruments or draft statutory instruments".</p></blockquote>
Does that not encompass this Committee, and so mean that we have a point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point, but the House referred the matter to this Committee. Our function here is to consider the statutory instrument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir James. Can I get this right? Are you telling me that what I am saying is correct but that you are not going to take me on?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: According to my advice, the Committee is perfectly in order in considering this matter with the present composition of the Committee. The Committee has been appointed by the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John McAllion 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir James. Standing Order No. 86, under which my hon. friend the Member for Kilmarnock and Londoun raised his point of order, relates to measures that Madam Speaker has designated as relating exclusively to Scotland. Paragraph 1(2) of the Statutory instrument states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"These Regulations shall extend to Scotland only."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, we are dealing with a statutory instrument that refers only to Scotland. Surely Standing Order No. 86 should be made to apply in this instance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am here merely at the request of Madam Speaker and the House of Commons, as are all Members of the Committee. We have been asked to consider the statutory instrument. That is our purpose this afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Meale 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Mansfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir James. Might it not be better if we adjourned the Committee while further advice is sought to clarify the matter? The Committee will not want to sit for an hour and a half, only to find that it has been a total waste of time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the hon. Gentleman that our proceedings this afternoon will not be a waste of time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.35 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The job of Opposition Members is to make things hard for the Government, not for you, Sir James. Nobody in Scotland wants the measure. We want to impress that on Conservative members who represent English constituencies. Greyhound racing in Scotland has declined over the years. The statutory instrument, if it is adopted, could cause its demise. History shows that two years after the licensing of betting shops was introduced in 1961, afternoon greyhound racing was wiped out. Between 1960 and 1970, attendances at greyhound racing events fell from 15 million to 7 million. It has been suggested that the statutory instrument will cause a rapid fall of 15 per cent, in evening attendances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two greyhound clubs in Scotland, Shawfield and Powderhall. They belong to the National Greyhound Racing Club. Many people gain entertainment and satisfaction from going to meetings at those tracks, not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0322">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
least those who go to see the form of the two dogs belonging to my hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun, which go by the names of Graciously and Rose Gold. Graciously is such a good dog that half the time it will not leave the trap when it is opened. The other half of the time, it looks for my hon. Friend on the terraces, wanders up to him, licks his nose—and forgets about the hare.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Meale</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to disrupt my hon. Friend, but he has the wrong dog. Rose Gold is the culprit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is even more entertaining.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Gallle 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not a member of the Committee, Sir James, but I understand that I may attend a sitting and intervene occasionally. The dog referred to by the hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall), which never leaves the trap, sounds like a potential Labour Prime Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unlike the Trident who represents Ayr? I see. I recall that I was very kind and considerate to the hon. Gentleman in the last Committee of which we were both members, and he has started off this afternoon by being insulting. I shall remember that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Shawfield and Powderhall are subject to registration and legislation. There are veterinary surgeons on the premises, as well as laboratories for dope testing. If Scotland loses those tracks, we shall be left with what are called the flapping tracks. They have less stringent conditions which do not have the same safeguards. That would not be in the best interests of the punters or the dogs, whose quality would decline as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister received 11 submissions from Scotland on the regulations, from the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, the Association of Chief Police Officers, the Association of Scottish Police Superintendents, the Scottish Police Federation, the Scottish Bookmakers Protection Association, the Scottish Consumer Council, the City of Glasgow licensing board, the East of Scotland Bookmakers Association and the Shawfield and Powderhall Greyhound Association. Not one of those organisations is in favour of the regulations. COSLA, which represents all local authorities, and the police bodies are vehemently against it so why do we have it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no Scottish Conservative Back Bencher on the Committee. We are subjected to this regulation because it is a diktat from the Home Office. Did the Secretary of State set up a committee to look into it? Of course he did not. He probably conferred with his friends in William Hill, in Ladbrokes and in Coral and said, "Right, boys, perhaps you have done me favours in the past. What favours can I do for you?" The reply was probably, "Well, you can get the greyhound races televised so that we can corner the market and get more business. In the process, if small and independent bookmakers go out of business, that does not matter to us. We will tell our employees on the line that their conditions will be changed."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of those employees are women who already have commitments. I had a letter from a woman with a handicapped son who suffered from cerebral palsy. She needed to be home at night but William Hill told her that she must accept that her conditions would be changed or she would be on the street. Her choice was to work night
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
after night to earn enough to support her son or to live on income support. That is what has happened as a result of this diktat. I believe that that is wrong and so do some Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quote from the news release issued by the Conservative Member for Stockton, South (Mr. Devlin). He spoke about the consultation process at the Home Office to which 900 people responded. Few were in favour of the regulation. Among betting office staff, 4,046 out of the 4,167 who responded to the Home Office consultation exercise declared themselves against it. In addition, the Secretary of State recieved three petitions, each containing more than 2,000 signatures, from greyhound racing supporters rejecting the proposals. What does the hon. Member for Stockton, South, a Conservative Back Bencher, think is the reason for that? He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"What this whole affair shows is that a shady deal has been struck between the vested interests of the bigger bookmakers and the Government, to the detriment of independent bookmakers, greyhound racing and betting shop staff."</p></blockquote>
Does not the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland feel ashamed to be making regulations for Scotland that were conceived in England for the benefit of two or three bookmakers, and that will damage the interests of employees in the industry and their families?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I received a signed letter from someone in Scotland but I shall not give his name as he could face the sack if I identified him. He said that he was informed by William Hill of his new contract of employment, which included evening work, and told that if he refused to sign it he would be dismissed forthwith. His choice is unlimited overtime to suit the company's business needs or the dole. That is absolutely shameful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scotland's social context should be taken into account. Many urban areas in Scotland are full during the day but deserts in the evenings. What are the implications of evening opening for the employees of bookmakers' shops, who are mainly women and have to take the day's takings to a local bank in an empty shopping area at 9 or 10 o'clock at night? Has the Minister considered their safety? That will be a big issue. When some men realise that betting shops will be open until 10 pm in areas where there are not many people, women could be easy prey to armed robbery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dare the Government undertake a consultation exercise? They should ask women for their views. Some people will leave work at 4 or 5 o'clock on a Friday evening and go to the bookies to place a bet. When they find that the bookies are open till 10 pm, they will go next door for a pint, come back at 7 o'clock and place another bet, before they go back to the pub for a pint, get a wee bit more drunk, lose more money, and finally return home, drunk and without money. That process of social disintegration could happen if evening opening is permitted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there were sound reasons for evening opening, I would be the first to consider them, but three big bookmakers support evening opening simply to make extra profit. Those bookmakers are probably involved in the food and drinks industry. Social disintegration will occur to increase their profits. That should not be tolerated in Scotland. The interests of the community, the workers and the punters at greyhound tracks should be taken into account. I speak on behalf of all my colleagues. Hook forward to hearing the Minister provide one scrap
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0323">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
of evidence to show why he, in all his wisdom, believes that the regulations will be good for Scotland. Chief police officers and others reject the proposals. Scotland is unanimous in opposing them. Let the Minister explain why he intends to force them on us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.47 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The basis of our objections to the extension of betting shop opening hours has been skilfully outlined by my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The make-up of the Committee fills me with dismay. I do not say that from a nationalistic point of view; I do not worry about people's ethnic origin. Some members of the Committee, apart from the Minister, may have an interest in Scottish affairs. They may have Scottish relatives, or their granny may have run away with a Gordon Highlander. Two Tory Members are sitting in Committee and will attempt to speak about the issues. Why are they not members of the Committee? What kind of deal was done to protect the Government if our proceedings follow the die that has been cast?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The make-up of the Committee is not even vaguely democratic. I do not argue that Anglos should not sit on Scottish Committees, because they can learn something about Scotland by doing so. There are Anglos among the Opposition members of the Committee, not because they are Anglos but because they have an interest in the racing industry and know the business. If every Conservative member of the Committee has a strong Scottish connection, or expertise in greyhound or horse racing, or in the bookmaking business, I shall be interested in their comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that a decision has been taken. The Home Secretary, who wishes to be known as El Libré, said recently that he wants to liberate the betting shops. I have news for the right hon. and learned Gentleman—if he wants to liberate Scotland, starting with the extension of betting shop hours, he has started at the wrong end. It would be better to give the Scottish people a multi-purpose referendum so that they can decide how best to govern themselves. The people of Scotland should decide when and for how long betting shops should be open.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The licensing boards in Scotland are quite liberal and perform an important function. When an application is made to open a betting shop, the board to which the application is made first considers the character of those applying and then whether opening such a shop would create any social difficulty. Then it can grant a licence, because it knows that betting shops in Scotland cannot remain open after half-past six.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now we are to have foisted on us—mainly by those who, if there were a vote, would have no direct connection with Scotland in terms of representing Scottish seats—regulations which we do not want. During the consultation process, the Home Secretary was given information regarding a survey into customer opinion. Customers were questioned in 13 William Hill, 11 Coral and nine Ladbrokes betting offices. William Hill, Coral and Ladbrokes are the three biggest bookmakers. Only three independent bookmakers were included in the poll, two of which represented the Betting Office Licensees Association on the big organisations. In Scotland, all
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
bookmakers who have submitted their views are unanimously opposed to any extension of opening hours. William Hill, Ladbrokes and Coral were so confident that they had the ear of the Home Secretary that they put in no submissions from Scotland. There are no BOLA submissions from Scotland Even BOLA does not appear to want the proposed extension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are only two greyhound racing tracks in Scotland regulated by the National Greyhound Racing Club Ltd. They operate on a very narrow profit margin. If the betting shops are allowed to open until 10 o'clock, especially on Fridays and Saturdays, there is no question but that the crowds that greyhound racing currently attracts will be diminished sufficiently to put the two tracks out of business. I shall read some of the submissions that we have had from Shawfield and Powderhall later in our proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Meale</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The bookmaker inquiry into betting shop opinion covered 35 or 36 shops throughout the United Kingdom, only two of which were in Scotland. It seems that during the course of a day, the total number of people consulted in Scotland amounted to 32 people in Glasgow and 32 in Edinburgh. That is ridiculous, considering the population of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a good point, and I have tried to illustrate it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Submissions are still coming in. I have one here, hot off the fax, from two bookmakers in my constituency. They probably depend on me for a large part of their income. I recall with some fondness that when I was hospitalised, the first get well card that I had when I woke up in the morning said, "Get well soon. Hurry back, Missing you. Takings down drastically. Harry and Gladys the bookies". I know bookmakers and they know me. I use their premises frequently and I know why they are opposed to late opening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the big three get a real grip on dog racing—especially in England, where they already own five out of the 12 BAGS tracks—and take over or close the dog tracks in Scotland and obtain an additional track or two in England, they will have a monopoly—or, rather, a triopoly. It is not healthy—it is immoral, in fact—for a bookmaker to own a racing track. Bookmakers should not be able to manipulate the odds and own the betting shops. Theirs may be the only ones left, as the late night extension—according to my correspondents—could close shops.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Richard Murray, of my constituency, makes the point that the big bookmakers
	<br><blockquote><p>"have already monopolised our daily race service by their ownership and loading this service so much that staff on a Saturday are in a position that at particular points on a Saturday where they should be having lunch breaks they have to cope with twelve races going off in a ten minute interval making it very difficult for staff to work contentedly and efficiently."</p></blockquote>
Small bookmakers have to bring in more staff when they can, which puts their costs up. If they have to bring in more staff for extended periods they will be in greater difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want Conservatives to think about what I have said, if only for one reason. It is mainly women who work in betting shops in Scotland. Already William Hill has told them, "There is your contract of employment. You will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0324">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
be required to work longer shifts, until 10 o'clock on Fridays and Saturdays, and on Sundays"—they are confident that they will have Sunday racing. Staff have been told that they will not receive extra increments for those hours of work, that days off in lieu of those worked can be taken only when racing is cancelled and that such days cannot be accumulated. In other words, staff are told, "There are your working arrangements. You sign the contract. Of course, this is a democracy, and we are giving you the opportunity not to sign. If you do not want to, you are finished on Friday." It is an outrage and a scandal in a civilised country and we should not accept it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot for the world understand why the Minister, who is well known to Committee Members and whom we would all, I am sure, consider a kind, understanding and humane gentleman, sits there presiding over the Conservative Benches, knowing that no one in Scotland wants the measure. If this were not a Standing Committee on Statutory Instruments, but a court, and if you, Sir James, were presiding not only as the chairman but as a judge, the person on trial would be the Minister. A jury of Scots would hear the charges against him. Opposition Members would be the prosecutors. Two charges would be laid, after all the submissions and evidence had been read.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the Minister would be charged with conspiracy, because he is conspiring with his colleagues to foist upon Scotland something that the people do not want. Secondly, he would be charged with complacency because he does not care about the wishes of the people of Scotland, and he will allow the foisting to take place. In those circumstances, after the jury, the people of Scotland, had considered even what has been heard so far, a case would have been made. You, Sir James, would have asked the jury, "Have you considered your verdict?" "We have, Sir," they would say. "Lord James Douglas-Hamilton," you would have to say, "Will you stand and face the jury. Will the jury deliver its verdict on the accusations of conspiracy and complacency?" "Guilty on both counts."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to the end of the matter, Sir James. Finally you would probably put a black cloth on your head and say, "Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, you are to be taken from this place and paraded as a dishonourable run round Shawfield and Powderhall"—which is almost in the Minister's own constituency. That is what would happen if we were engaged in a democratic process, but nothing will convince me that that is the case, unless, on a Division, those hon. Members who have considered the evidence carefully will support the Opposition in voting against the statutory instrument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been following carefully the hon. Gentleman's remarks. He is in the position in which his colleagues frequently accused me of being—he has an interest in a matter that we are debating. The terms of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
criticism—when it is directed at me—are that because I have an interest, I cannot follow the democratic process with the impartiality that is required to make a reasoned judgment. How can the hon. Gentleman convince me that, in this context, he is not in the same position?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should have declared an interest. Let me state, from the outset, that I am chairman of the all-party greyhound group. Therefore, I have an interest in greyhounds. I own a quarter share of two greyhounds—or perhaps a half share of one greyhound, depending on which one I can dispose of—so my financial interest in greyhounds has, so far, cost me a fortune. There is a saying in Scotland, "If you have an enemy, give them a greyhound pup and you'll ruin them." I am almost on the point of ruination because of my interest in greyhounds. I certainly do not have a financial interest All that I am given is membership of the greyhound club, which entitles me to visit any National Greyhound Racing Club track in the country, with my membership card. That club is open to all parliamentarians and we have an excellent all-party group.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has just made the point that it would be in his interests if the greyhound racing tracks in Scotland were closed, before he becomes bankrupt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have answered the hon. Gentleman's question: I do it not for any particular or personal gain, but because I am concerned about the jobs that the Shawfield and Powderhall stadiums provide, about all the jobs, held mainly by women, that are threatened at the consortium's betting shops and about difficulties that they may encounter on late night openings. Although that will happen only in the summer, the staff will probably be smaller. Already, there is a growing tendency for bookmakers shops to be held up in Scotland, by people wielding hatchets, knives and, on three occasions recently sawn-off shotguns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a problem in Scotland, which will get worse if we extend hours to give people the opportunity to raid the betting shops. Although the police say that they can contain the situation, they are concerned that the later night openings may create difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even those people who accept the late-night opening of the betting shops all believe that they should not stay open until 10 o'clock. The Home Affairs Select Committee said that they should close no later than 9 o'clock, and, if possible, they should be geared down, to an 8 o'clock closing or 9 o'clock closing at the maximum. We have been forced to accept 10 o'clock opening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Every submission—the Minister will have already scrutinised them—says that we cannot and should not have betting shops open on a Saturday evening. Saturday evening would knock the greyhound stadiums off because that is the biggest and best night for them. It has been said, "Why don't the greyhound people get their act in order?" They have done so: we have the finest greyhound tracks in the world. I suggest that all Committee Members should take a trip to Walthamstow or Wimbledon to experience the service that the public is provided at those magnificent tracks. We want to keep those tracks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Scotland tried some innovations. The greatest innovation was inviting the public to greyhound racing on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0325">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
a Saturday night for free. In the first couple of Saturdays, people were piling in—Scots will go anywhere if it is for nothing—but, it started to settle down. Once the innovation was no longer an innovation, the excitement of a free night at the dogs did not appeal to those who were not really interested and attendances went back to being made up of the same group of people who are the backbone of greyhound racing, and the tracks started charging again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government ask, "Why don't they take more money off the Tote?" If the tracks take more money off the Tote to compensate for diminishing attendances, attendances will fall still further because people want a fair deal from the Tote. They do not want bookmakers to take a bigger whack of their money without distributing it We are at the limit of what we can take off the Tote. Customers will accept no further diminution of the prize money that they can win at the greyhounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are trapped, just like my dog who does not come out of his trap, because the Home Secretary has decided that as a decision has been taken for England and Wales, it will be foisted on the people of Scotland irrespective of the submissions that may be made or whether there is any justice in it. I appeal to those members of the Committee who have not already made up their minds to consider the weight of evidence, listen to the Minister's views on that and consider what will be done to an industry that has not asked for the measure. They should remember that the big three bookmakers—Coral, William Hill and Ladbrokes—have not submitted a request for late-night openings in Scotland. As there is no demand for it, why are we wasting our time going through this process in order to satisfy the whim of the Secretary of State, who wishes to be El Libré? I ask members of the Committee to consider those issues carefully. If they do, they will agree with the points that have been made by the Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Renton 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Mid-Sussex)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to the hon. Members for Kilmarnock and Loudoun and for Dumbarton with great interest. I am one of the renegade English members of the Committee, who the Opposition feel should not be sitting in the Committee at all. Renton is a Scottish name, my wife is Scottish and has a little cottage in the Hebrides, and I am lucky enough to go to Scotland very often. However, I agree with Opposition Members that my name does not give me a particular right to decide on an inherently Scottish problem. As the Opposition have requested, I come to the Committee with a singularly open mind, and that may worry my Whip. I shall listen to the arguments—I hope that they will not go on too long—and I shall vote according to my conscience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Kilmarnock and Loudoun and for Dumbarton spoke with great passion but they said two things that surprised me. In particular, I refer to the opening remarks of the hon. Member for Dumbarton. He said—
	<i>Hansard</i> will prove this—that acceptance of the measure would cause social disintegration in Scotland. That is an odd statement. I can think of other things that would cause social disintegration in Scotland. I have travelled through Glasgow and I realise that, over the years, it has suffered from problems related to alcohol and
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
too many drugs being available on the streets. They are causes of social disintegration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From my stance in Sussex, 450 miles from Scotland, the idea that the evening opening of betting shops will cause social disintegration surprises me. I thought mat the Scots were tougher than that. There are some problems, which have been aired, associated with betting shops opening in the evening, but I thought that the Scots would survive them without social disintegration. There may be problems for the Tote and for the greyhound tracks and they have been eloquently described, but the measure will not result in social disintegration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McFall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was implying the promotion of social disintegration. I referred to betting shops opening on Friday and Saturday evenings and the resulting propensity for people to gamble more. I have excellent support for my view. In its submission to the Royal Commission on betting and gaming in 1976–78, the Royal College of Psychiatrists pointed out that when
	<br><blockquote><p>"more people gamble and existing gamblers gamble more … there is a consequent increased incidence of some people gambling to excess."</p></blockquote>
Social disintegration is promoted by people going home to their wives and families with less money and perhaps more inebriated. There is a compelling reason for what I said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Renton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman is none the less exaggerating. Are there statistics from the Tote or from race horse betting to suggest that the Scots are more prone to gamble than the English? If so, I have never seen them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are the views of Opposition Members on the introduction of the national lottery? When I was Minister for the Arts I very much favoured it, as money from it could go to good causes. My impression was that hon. Members representing Scottish constituencies were generally every bit as much in favour of the national lottery as were hon. Members representing English constituencies. Have they changed their views? I do not think that that is evident from Second Reading. Hon. Members from both sides of the House were worried about the effect of the national lottery on the ability of small charities to raise money. That is perfectly fair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As someone who is married to a Scots wife and has certain roots in Scotland, I am worried by the fear of social disintegration as a result of a minor extension of betting hours. Opposition Members are making a strange point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jimmy Wray 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Provan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is obvious that the right hon. Gentleman does not have too much knowledge of betting shops. I was born and bred in an area of 66 acres in which mere were 75 betting shops and 125 public houses. It was riddled with poverty. Obviously, we do not want that to be repeated. Youngsters of 14 or 15 spent their time looking into betting shops, wondering at what age they could bet. We witnessed much hardship, misery and poverty. It is obvious that the right hon. Gentleman has not experienced that We want to get rid of betting shops, which feast like vultures on the weaknesses of men and women. It is surely enough for them to be open from 10 am to 6.30 pm. They are also a health hazard by being smoking dens. If bookmakers had any care or compassion for poor people, they would not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0326">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
allow them to huddle inside their smoke-filled shops with their two or three pounds; they would take their bets and let them go out again. We are against those shops being open until 10 o'clock at night and creating muggers' alleys for people going inside and placing bets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Renton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes an emotional point with considerable passion. My point is slightly different. Why should there be such pressures in Glasgow, Aberdeen, Paisley and Edinburgh, but not in Liverpool, Newcastle or Sheffield? It surprises me that hon. Members representing Scottish constituencies feel so strongly that this, in the words of the hon. Member for Dumbarton, will cause such social disintegration in Scotland. There are reasons for social disintegration, but I never thought that the evening opening of betting shops was one of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The national lottery will be an extension of an instinct to bet. People will buy tickets because they want to win £1 million. If they do not win, part of the money that they have staked—40 per cent., 50 per cent. or, I hope, as much as possible—will go to a range of good causes involving art, heritage and charities. I am all for that. I did not notice real opposition from Scottish Members to the national lottery.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Renton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I shall make one more point and then finish because other hon. Members want to speak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My other point is to the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun and may be slightly frivolous. He described his ownership of a greyhound, or as he said, two quarters of two greyhounds or a half of one greyhound, presumably depending on the week, the month or how the dog was runnning. As he said that he had no reason to declare an interest when responding to what was a half-jocular remark made by my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker), did he mean that he owns a greyhound—or two-quarters or one half of a greyhound—to lose money? Surely not. He may have lost money, but I cannot believe, however humanitarian he is in his wish to keep greyhound tracks going, that he intends to lose money. If I were lucky enough to own the leg of a greyhound, I would have bought it to make money, which would make it necessary to declare an interest. My hon. Friend has a point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I have satisfied the Committee that I declared an interest. Perhaps because the right hon. Gentleman is not au fait with the greyhound racing industry, I should say that those who make a fortune from it are few and far between. The Rollers that sit outside a stadium always belong to the bookies. They do not belong to the men who are running the dogs. We who run dogs, like the members of the parliamentary group, take an interest in dogs because we feel that we can give something back to the industry. It gives us a lot, taking us to visit tracks, to look at the dogs and to examine the conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the right hon. Gentleman asked me whether my dream was to have a Derby winner, I would say that I would love to have one. I would have my photograph taken and it would be seen coast to coast in the national newspapers. It would be a marvellous thrill. That is a
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
dream, but as a lifelong gambler, I often dream about things such as the pools. However, I must put the right hon. Gentleman right on one point, so that he can understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A problem of betting shops being open on Friday evenings until 10 pm is that people finish work at S pm on Friday with a wage packet in their pocket. If they go to a betting shop, at the moment they can bet on only one race. They may put their wage packet on it, but that is not usual. Most people stick two quid on the last race. If there were races at 5.30, 6, 6.30, 7, 7.30 and so on, plus greyhound racing and racing brought in from South Africa, wage packets could be spent on a Friday night in an attempt to win back what had been lost earlier. That is what would happen. It would be the beginning of social disintegration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is all very well for the right hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Renton) to make throw-away and insulting remarks about the Scottish people from the safety of deepest Sussex. He does not represent a constituency such as those on the peripheries of major Scottish cities with male unemployment rates of 60 to 70 per cent., endemic poverty, a threat to law and order and a threat to the social structure caused by the wanton free market approach to the organisation of gambling on greyhound racing represented by his Government's attitude. I should be grateful to the right hon. Member if he would accept that the people who are best placed to decide what should happen in Scottish cities and to the Scottish part of the racing industry are those who represent Scotland, and no one else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his usual intemperate concession. Unlike the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun, he has not yet learnt how to give way gracefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are not the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends making an argument for no betting shops? If we are to have them, there must be an understanding of their function. If the hon. Gentleman's argument is that gambling is dangerous and bad and will lead to social disorder because people will back their entire pay packet, it would be logical to have no betting shops.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman again shows his ignorance. I have before me a detailed analysis of the problems that will have to be tackled if there is evening opening of betting shops in Scotland. It has been compiled by the bookmakers themselves because of their concern about what will happen if their shops are allowed to open. It is not a question of not having any bookies, or greyhound racing; it is a question of proper regulation and managing, for the advantage of all and the disadvantage of none.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members are making a case for their fears about Friday night opening. I come from a mining community and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0327">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
have observed Friday afternoon betting in bookies' shops. The right hon. Member for Mid-Sussex may not be aware of the shift patterns worked in mines. It was common for people to finish work on Friday at lunchtime, with their pay packets in their pockets, and spend the best part of Friday afternoon in the betting shop and the pub, to the detriment of their families. This is not a theoretical matter, we are talking of what happens and has been seen to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our concern is justified. I am worried that what we fear will come to pass. It is a question not of what may be, but of what has been, in similar circumstances elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point. He responded to a problem identified by the right hon. Member for Mid-Susex, who seems to think that our concern is that such things will happen in Glasgow and Dundee and nowhere else. Our worry is that they will happen across the United Kingdom. That is why many of the Scottish members of this Committee were members of last week's statutory instrument Committee relating to England and Wales, and why they voted against the measure—for the simple reason that we fear that the proposals will impact badly throughout the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Meale</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend accept that not everything that the hon. Member for Tayside, North says is negative? This measure is unusual in that the Home Office has created regulations in England that will affect Scotland, and will promote gambling. That has never been the role of the Home Office; its role has been to regulate gambling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend speaks with all the authority of a member of the Home Affairs Select Committe. What he says should be heeded not only by his hon. Friends but by Conservative Members who have a genuine interest in the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have declared earlier my own interest. I am the treasurer of the all-party greyhound group in the House. I also hold membership of the Greyhound Committee, and I enjoy free access to the NGRC greyhound track. In common with my hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun, I share ownership of the two said dogs. I do not know whether that makes me part owner of the dogs or owner of part of the dogs, but it at least shows my interest in the subject being debated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was enamoured of my hon. Friend's suggestion that the Minister be led in disgrace around Powderhall to be ridiculed by the punters because of the damage that he is doing to the industry. I suspect that he would come out of trap 2, which, traditionally, is the blue trap in greyhound racing. No doubt his hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie), who has left the Committee, would come out of the orange trap, no. 5.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The serious aspect of the debate is the impact of the evening opening of betting shops on the greyhound industry. My hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton mentioned the fall in attendances which followed the introduction of betting shops in 1961. During the 1960s, attendances at greyhound tracks fell by more than SO per cent. We must remember that during that time the shops did not offer live television coverage of greyhound or
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
horse racing or some other sports. However, we must remember that nowadays there is live satellite coverage of races both in this country and elsewhere. The impact of evening opening today will be even more severe than the original effect when betting shops were opened in 1961.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People involved in the greyhound racing industry say that the likely impact is that all but two of the stadiums will lose about 50 per cent. of their profits. Conservative Members pride themselves on knowing a bit about private enterprise and the world of business. What business could survive a 50 per cent. loss in its profits? No business in Britain could survive that. The regulation will mean that all but two of the independent stadiums will suffer that loss and are likely to go under.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not worried only about Shawfield and Powderhall. Punters in Scotland bet on races at other tracks—at Walthamstow, Wimbledon and Crayford, for example. The survival of those tracks is vital to punters in Scotland, just as it is to punters in England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say "independent" stadiums, because they do not belong to the group of five tracks which are owned by the big three bookmakers, William Hill, Ladbrokes and Coral. Those five stadiums are not affected by the evening opening of betting shops because if attendance at the track slumps, the bookmakers will gain by increased patronisation of their shops. The independent greyhound tracks will not be so lucky. If attendances slump, they will not get anything from the money that has been bet in the shops. As a result, they will go under.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The prospect is that the independent greyhound racing tracks will be wiped out by the evening opening of betting shops. We will be left with the triopoly of the big three bookmakers. They will put the squeeze on everyone else. They have the betting shops and the tracks and they will ensure that everybody else goes under while they have a clear run. I cannot understand why Conservative Members should vote for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The more I listen to the hon. Gentleman the more convinced I become that there should be only on-track betting, and that we do not need off-track betting at all. That seems to be what he is saying. If so, people like me—who are not very keen on gambling anyway—wonder whether he might not be better advised to say that he opposes all off-track betting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to convince Conservative Members to vote against the statutory instrument because of the impact that it will have on the greyhound racing industry. Tory Members should consider whether, despite the Government's expertise at shutting down industries such as Leyland DAF and others, they want the greyhound racing industry to collapse. It is no small matter. The people who run the industry assure us that it will disappear, except for tracks controlled by the big three. Another 10,000 redundancies could ensue. With unemployment about to break 3 million officially—and 4 million unofficially—we do not need any unnecessary additions to the total.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Meale</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may also like to consider that it is not only greyhound tracks that are rightly concerned, because if they suffer a IS per cent, loss in turnover, they are likely to face closure. Hags are being

waved because people think that horseracing will benefit from this measure, but in the press today there is talk of importing Irish racing and that will disadvantage our horseracing industry. People who would usually bet during the day at British racetracks or in betting shops on British races will be able to bet in the evening on Irish races.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. McAllion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point. Last week when we discussed the English and Welsh statutory instrument, the Minister emphasised the fact that this measure has the support of the racing industry. The horse racing industry has the benefit of the horse race betting levy which brings it income every time a bet is laid in a betting shop on a horse race, but that is not true of greyhound racing. No agreed sum is received by the greyhound racing industry. If we switch support from greyhound tracks to betting shops, only the big three bookies will benefit. Greyhound tracks will not benefit, and if their income is diminished their survival will be put at risk, thereby undermining an important form of leisure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members have been inundated with letters from people who work in bookmakers shops and are concerned about the imposition of new working conditions by the big three bookies. This matter was raised when we debated the English and Welsh statutory instruments. The Minister's advice was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If employees do not wish to change their contracts, but the employer behaves as if they have been changed, they could sue the employer for breach of contract."[
	<i>Official Report, Fifth Standing Committee on Statutory Instuments, &c,</i> 10 February 1993; c. 13.]</p></blockquote>
He argued that contracts must be negotiated and should not be breached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I represent Dundee, a city in which the Timex plant is located. The workers there are on strike. They belong to the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union, which is one of the most powerful trade unions in this country. The strike has the official backing of the union, but it is powerless to prevent the employer from ripping up the negotiated agreement and imposing conditions on the work force. If one of the strongest unions cannot stand up to such treatment, what chance have part-time betting office staff who are not represented by trade unions because they are not recognised by the big three bookmakers? How can they stand up to imposed working conditions? Of course, they could go to court and sue then-employers for breach of contract and run the risk of losing their case. The Government admitted today that they are reducing legal aid in civil suits for people on low incomes. People who work in betting shops will not qualify for legal aid and will have to put all their belongings at risk to take their employers to court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must listen to sense. This is a bad statutory instrument. It has been introduced for the wrong reasons, and the Government have not taken full stock of its implications for one of our most important industries, Our manufacturing base has been eroded to such an extent that we now depend on the leisure industry for employment. If the Government insist on this statutory instrument, it will help to destroy the sort of leisure industry that this country badly needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I, too, have wondered why the Committee of Selection, in its wisdom, decided to put me on this Committee. But as I have sat here, my interest has been aroused. I hold no brief for betting shops. I gamble perhaps only once a year on the grand national—I cannot think of a bigger gamble than that. I must admit that I find betting shops rather sordid places; I think that they could be improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many years ago I ran an insurance broking business. An unemployed man came to see me—we had unemployment even then—and he told me a sob story about why he could not renew his car insurance. He asked me whether I would let him pay over a number of months. Being a kind-hearted chap, I said yes. Half an hour later on my way to the bank, I passed the local betting shop and saw him emerging. Presumably, he had spent the money he was going to pay me if I had not been so kind-hearted. I take the point about the opportunity for that kind of betting and its effect on social behaviour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I do not have an interest to declare in greyhound racing I have for some time been adviser to the Bingo Association of Great Britain and helped pilot two private Member's Bills through Parliament. The hon. Member for Mansfield was most helpful when the last Bill was being considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have always asserted that they do not want to do anything that stimulates gambling; every Home Office Minister has said that when the subject has been discussed. It is odd that we now have a measure that presumably is intended to encourage people to gamble in betting shops. If that is not the intention, why is the measure before us? I confess my ignorance of whether it will apply in England and Wales; perhaps it applies already and we are extending the law to Scotland. That is another example of how measures slip through the House without our knowing what is happening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is as helpful to me today as he has been on previous occasions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A fundamental issue has been raised. If the Government's stance since the Gaming Act 1968 has been that it is not their job to stimulate gaming or gambling, somebody, somewhere must stop and think where we are going. My right hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex mentioned the national lottery. Presumably, the Government will stimulate interest in that or there will be no proceeds for the various charities and sporting organisations that hope to benefit from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government have changed their attitude to the stimulation of gambling they should say so. We should look at the various measures that apply to gambling. As the hon. Gentleman said, the Home Affairs Select Committee has embarked on a long-winded investigation, starting with horse racing and then greyhound racing. It has not yet completed its full study.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should not be necessary for a hon. Member to have the luck to win the ballot for private Members' Bills to make a minor amendment to the law. If there has been a

seachange in the Government's view and they sincerely believe that people want a different regime and tremendous liberalisation, they should say so. However, that is not the response of Home Office Ministers, acting on official advice, in Standing Committees considering other private Members' Bills or in debates on the Floor of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am in difficulty because I am speaking to the wrong Minister. It is clear that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary is talking about Scotland; I am anxious about the whole country. I want a Home Office Minister on this Committee so that I can ask him a few pertinent questions, such as: when did the Government change their mind and decide that it was okay and popular to stimulate gambling? Are the Government prepared to consider other changes in the law to encourage a more sensible regime?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased that I was chosen to sit on this Committee. I do not find tremendous merit in the order, but if it already applies to England, why should we deny the Scots the miseries that we have to endure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Fry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was a jocular remark. Instead of introducing bits and pieces of proposals for gambling it is high time the Government embarked on a thorough investigation which would lead to a clear policy. If it was necessary to change the law, a major Act of Parliament, such as the Gaming Act 1968, should be debated on the Floor of the House. That would avoid the trouble caused by what is a minor matter in England but an issue of major importance to Scottish Members of Parliament. It would be much more satisfactory than the present approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall indeed, Sir James, Members of Parliament do not really control what happens in betting shops. I have known bookmakers, both legal and illegal, who gave their customers 50p in the pound to stay in the shops during raids. If we allow betting shops to open until 10 o'clock at night and if we interfere with the licensed tracks, we shall end up with flapping gaffs, and dogs being treated inhumanely. We do not want dogs to be given substances—such as purple hearts or syrups—that will stop them at the first bend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a big difference between betting shops and greyhound racing at a track, where families can go for a pleasant night's betting. A betting shop has a dozen races on the card—Ladbrokes got its name because every lad who want in came out broke. I have seen much misery caused by betting shops. I have lived in a poverty stricken area where every week wages disappeared on horse racing and on every other sort of racing. I know the problems that betting shops can create and that is why I oppose the regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People may go to greyhound racing every evening during the week but it is more common to go on a
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
Saturday evening. Betting shop employees are going to be affected if we allow shops to open until 10 o'clock at night. Surely it would be in the Government's interest to keep them closed in the evening. People who are looking for gambling money will go out and climb the rone pipe of the first house they come across to get the cash to back the last favourite in the hope of getting a drink at the end of the evening. It would suit me if the betting shops were closed altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not continue, as I know that the Minister must wind up, but I hope that he will bear in mind that the licensed tracks ensure that the dogs are well looked after and have a vet to examine them before races. We do not want a return to the old stadiums, in which dogs would run their guts out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a useful debate. It is ironic that I should be replying to it, as during the election the bookies were taking bets that I would not be re-elected. However, I am still around, like the proverbial bad penny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can tell my hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough that it is not my purpose to encourage excessive gambling. As he knows, a wide range of opportunities to gamble already exists. The existing controls on advertising are designed to prevent excessive gambling and they will remain in force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As hon. Members are aware, this matter was debated last week. Some hon. Members—the hon. Members for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard), for Sunderland, North (Mr. Etherington), and for Mansfield (Mr. Meale)—took part in that debate. I saw a photograph in 
	<i>The Scotsman</i> today of the hon. Members for Kilmarnock and Loudoun, for Dumbarton, for Paisley, North (Mrs. Adams) and for Dundee, East. They were escorting six greyhounds, although I could not tell whether Graciously or Rose Gold were among them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate hon. Members' legitimate strong feelings about the subject. However, the proposal is not a bolt from the blue. The evening opening of betting shops was discussed in the 1970s and considered by the Rothschild royal commission in a report published in 1978. In 1991, the Select Committee on Home Affairs considered the horse race betting levy and the funding of greyhound racing. It recommended evening opening. One report criticised the Government for not moving more quickly to permit evening opening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thorough consultation is necessary before sensible decisions are made about matters that affect people's livelihoods. A consultation paper was, therefore, issued in October 1991 and sent to local authorities, the churches, the police, and those who have bookmaking and racing interests. The responses and representations were carefully considered before the decision was made to permit betting offices to open until 10 pm in the summer months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Meale</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I served on all the Select Committee inquiries that the Minister mentioned. The Select Committee recommended 9 o'clock as the latest opening time for betting shops. As my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton has said, the Select Committee believed
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0330">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
that an earlier closing time should be supported when the matter was discussed in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not accurate to claim that the Select Committee on Home Affairs whole-heartedly supported evening opening. Support was conditional on the Government accepting that large amounts of money for a levy should be paid to the greyhound industry before permitting evening opening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raises two important points. We decided to permit evening opening until 10 o'clock because, in 1992, 55 horse races ran at 9 pm or later. An earlier closing time would mean that betting offices would have to close while races were in progress. That would undermine the value of relaxing controls and could cause enforcement problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the case for a levy for the greyhound industry. Extended betting shop hours do not justify a greyhound levy. The Government will consider any proposal for a levy that has the joint support of the betting and greyhound industries. I could say more about that, but I wish to make progress. Perhaps we can return to the matter later if there is sufficient time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a significant increase in the number of evening horse race meetings. In 1978, there were only 62 such meetings, but by 1992 they had increased to 144. A quarter of all meetings from April to August were held in the evening. There has been an increase in demand for off-course betting facilities. A recent Gallup survey showed that 56 per cent. of customers supported evening opening and that 72 per cent, believed that bookmakers should be allowed to choose their own opening hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to likely customer demand, the Government took account of an important argument of principle. The removal of unnecessary regulations encourages competition and gives all types of business the flexibility to meet the changing needs of then-customers. That means greater consumer choice, a matter to which the Government attach great importance. Provided that gambling is properly regulated, the Government believe that there should be adequate facilities available for those who wish to bet while horse racing is in progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Evening opening may also generate additional income for horse racing. The increase in evening racing has come about because of its popularity with racegoers and is an example of racing responding to its customers' needs. It is anticipated that evening opening will give new impetus to evening horse racing and generate new income for it via the betting levy. The development of such an opportunity is a matter for negotiation between the racing industry and bookmakers but the Government's role is to remove unnecessary regulations that inhibit it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of bookmaker—not only the big three, Ladbrokes, Coral and William Hill—believe that businesses and customers will benefit from evening opening. However, it will remain the commercial judgment of each bookmaker to decide his own opening hours. Evening opening could assist in protecting jobs and creating new employment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, when I have put the evidence before the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that more representations against evening opening were received by the Home Office than representations in favour.

Strong support was expressed by influential and representative bodies such as the Horserace Betting Levy Board, the Jockey Club, the Horserace Totalisator Board—the Tote—and the Betting Office Licensees Association as well as the big three, Ladbrokes, Hill and Coral. Of those opposed, the main representation came from greyhound racing. In Scotland, representatives of the two greyhound stadiums, Shawfield and Wishaw, expressed opposition, and some small bookmakers—in particular the Scottish SP Bookmakers Association and the East of Scotland Bookmakers Association were opposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conversely, Edgar Ramsay Bookmakers, writing from Easter road in Edinburgh, expressed support, making the point that evening opening would place betting offices on all fours with other retail interests which were not able to cover the cost of fixed items such as rates over a longer trading period each day. The vast majority of betting office staff who commented were opposed, but, as my hon. Friend the Minister of State, Home Office, said last week, the 4,427 employees who replied represent only 8.5 per cent, of all betting shop employees and one would expect those against to write in whereas those who were in favour might not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All horse racing interests were in favour of evening opening and no doubt they had in mind the fact that a significant proportion of horse racing takes place in the evening—with a substantial number of races after nine o'clock. A Gallup survey showed that 56 per cent, of customers wanted betting shops to remain open and 72 per cent. thought that the shops should be able to decide for themselves.

The police associations said that they had no objection in principle to evening opening, in Scotland, the Association of Chief Police Officers (Scotland) and the Association of Scottish Police Superintendents considered that the conduct of licensed betting offices did not give cause for concern and they did not foresee operational difficulties in the proposed extension of opening hours.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has rattled off a catalogue of statistics which, in the main, relate to England. May I remind the hon. Gentleman that we are debating a Scottish statutory instrument? Although he is now reading out details of Scottish submissions, no one there has promoted the idea of late-night betting, apart from one bookie—Ramsay. Can the Minister tell me how many betting shops Mr. Edgar Ramsay has throughout Scotland? One has positively supported the proposal; all the others may not object, but they have not actively promoted it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have given as evidence the Gallup poll result, which showed that 75 per cent. thought that bookmakers should be free to decide. The specifically Scottish representations have been circulated to the Committee. I have made it clear that as regards the law and order aspect, the chief police officers and the Scottish superintendents association thought that no operational difficulties would arise. The Association of Scottish Police Superintendents stated that it is rare for incidents which involve a police presence to occur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition are being unnecessarily pessimistic about the attractions of dog racing and the loyalty of its clientele. I note that this view does not necessarily extend across all in the industry, and that attendances at greyhound race meetings appear to have increased since the recent announcement of evening opening. Greyhound racing should not underestimate its own strengths as a marketable and attractive product for an entertaining evening out. It can offer many attractions with which an evening spent in a betting office simply cannot compete. I know that many tracks, including Powderhall and Shawfield, have made significant developments in recent years to attract new customers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested that a number of small bookmakers might suffer as a result of evening opening. As I have said, the policy allows each bookmaker a greater flexibility to determine his own opening hours. As my hon. Friend for Wellingborough said, that does not mean that any bookmaker will be obliged to open after 6.30 pm, if he or she does not want to do so. Indeed, there will be no opening on Sundays. However, in the week day evenings from April to August, there may be additional custom, which could benefit small shops.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I just develop the arguments, as there are some points that I am anxious to answer?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Small betting offices tend to be in residential areas, which could give them a competitive advantage in attracting evening trade. Let us not forget that not all the smaller bookmakers have been opposed to evening opening; some have certainly recognised the potential advantages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware of the point that the hon. Member for Dumbarton earlier made about the effect on employees. There may be greater development opportunities for some and a chance to increase their earnings. I also understand his argument that some betting office employees have been aggrieved at being asked to sign new employment contracts. Businesses of all kinds respond to changing circumstances and betting offices are not exempt. Changes in conditions of service remain a matter for companies and their staff and not for the Government. Nevertheless, I trust that sensible employers will wish to retain their experienced, valuable staff and will behave accordingly. There are, of course, suitable remedies under existing employment protection law for inappropriate behaviour. If an employer unilaterally imposes new terms upon an employee who is unwilling to accept and has completed at least two years continuous service, he may resign and seek redress at an industrial tribunal. In addition, any employee, however short his service, can sue the employer for breach of contract I recognise that these remedies may take time and trouble—as Opposition Members remarked in the other debate—but the rights do, nevertheless, exist to protect employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have dealt already with fears about crime and representation by the police. In the two minutes that I have left, I shall make one further point. Some concerns have been expressed about the effect on local residents. I think it is true to say that bookmakers have a good record on that, and those who decide to open in the evening will want to avoid any problems occurring since they might otherwise find themselves in difficulties regarding the renewal of their licence under the normal procedures whereby local residents could object. Discretion must and should remain with licensing boards to refuse to grant or renew a licence if, among other things, the location is unsuitable for use as a licensed betting office or the premises have not been properly conducted under the licence previously. There are, of course, many businesses that operate in the evening without causing a nuisance and I do not see that bookmakers cannot do the same.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
