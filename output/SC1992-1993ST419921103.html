	<div class='title'>Draft Firearms Acts (Amendment) Regulations 1992</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State For The Home Department (Mr. Charles Wardle)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Firearms Acts (Amendment) Regulations 1992.</p></blockquote>
At the outset, Mr. Cook, I welcome you in your new role. Today is St. Hubert's day. St. Hubert is the patron saint of shooters, and it may be of interest to some members of the Committee that he was also an 8th century Bishop of Maastricht.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft regulations will implement requirements of the EC directive on the control of the acquisition and possession of weapons. They will do no more than give effect to our Community obligations and are, I hope the Committee will agree, entirely uncontroversial. I shall go through each of the provisions for the Committee's benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The directive is intended to compensate for the removal of systematic border checks when the single market comes into effect in January 1993. It sets minimum standards which all Community states must achieve in their national firearms controls, but states may have stricter controls than the minimum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Successful negotiations by the United Kingdom achieved major improvements in the directive's content. As a result, no substantial changes need to be made to our current domestic firearms controls. Most important of all, I stress that there will be no relaxation of the stringent controls which Parliament has seen fit to impose on the use of firearms in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the whole, our firearms controls are stricter than the directive's minimum requirements. But there are a few instances in which that is not the case, so we need to make some minor adjustments to our legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most notable change is the extension of our existing category of prohibited weapons and ammunition to include those items which the directive says must be banned in all Community states. Draft regulation 3 raises into our prohibited category firearms disguised as other objects; explosive military missiles and their launchers; armour-piercing and incendiary ammunition for military use, and expanding pistol ammunition. Missiles for the newly prohibited types of ammunition will also become prohibited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the measures have caused some anxiety within the shooting community, but the directive requires us to prohibit those items and we must abide by it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The good news is that we have made special provision for those who have a serious interest in collecting the newly prohibited firearms or ammunition. They may have a special condition added to their firearm or shotgun certificate which will allow them to keep the newly prohibited items, provided that they do so only as part of
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
a collection. The new condition will be prescribed by rules amending the Firearms Rules 1989 which my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department intends to make shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall be running a scheme for owners of disguised firearms who are not collectors and do not wish to sell their firearms. If they held such firearms legally on 16 July, the day after the regulations were laid, and if they surrender them to the police before 1 January 1993, the date on which the regulations will come into force if approved, they will be able to apply for an ex gratia payment. Payments will be based on the market value of the firearms concerned immediately before the draft regulations were laid before Parliament. I stress that that concerns disguised firearms, for example those disguised as an umbrella or a walking stick.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also made special provision for those who use expanding pistol ammunition and I know that that is of interest to shooters. Such ammunition is widely used in this country for target shooting, vermin control and other legitimate purposes. The directive recognises that by allowing such ammunition to be used by suitably authorised persons for hunting and target shooting. Hunting must be understood here in its European sense of any shooting of wild animals, game or birds, and not in the limited way in which we would normally interpret it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Firearm certificate holders will be able to buy and use expanding pistol ammunition and like missiles for the purposes authorised by the directive. The authorised purposes are sporting purposes, shooting vermin, estate husbandry, slaughtering purposes, competitive shooting inlcuding target shooting, and target shooting outside competition. That should reassure shooters who have expressed concern about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those who wish to take advantage of the exemption will simply need to have a special condition added to their firearm certificates. Similarly, registered firearms dealers will be able to supply such ammunition and missiles to exempted certificate holders by having a special condition added to their certificate or registration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Draft regulation 4 implements the directive's requirement that no one under the age of 18 should be allowed to acquire or possess firearms except for hunting or target shooting. Again, hunting is meant in the broader European sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We propose to give effect to that requirement by providing that certificate holders under 18 may use their firearms and shotguns only for the purposes authorised by the directive, which I have outlined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Draft regulation 5 introduces the new European firearms pass. From 1 January next year British residents will need a European firearms pass to take their firearms to another Community state; for example, on a shooting trip. Firearm and shotgun certificate holders will be automatically entitled to a pass in respect of the firearms covered by their certificates and the pass will be issued free by their local chief police officer; Following a United Kingdom initiative, all Community states have agreed a common format for the pass, which should make life easier for both travelling shooters and the enforcement agencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Draft regulation 5 also introduces a second new document called an article 7 authority. British residents will need an article 7 authority to purchase or acquire on the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0474">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
continent certain firearms for which prior permission is required. Again, article 7 authorities will be issued free by local chief officers of police.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the same way that British residents will need a European firearms pass to take firearms abroad, so we must ensure that EC visitors bringing firearms here have a European firearms pass issued by another Community state.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, all overseas visitors who wish to bring firearms to this country must apply for a British visitor's permit. We intend to retain that system. Although the directive sets minimum standards, domestic firearms controls in other Community states will continue to vary widely. As long as that remains the case, we think it right that we should continue to ensure the EC visitor to this country fulfil our rigorous public safety requirement by applying for a British visitor's permit before they may be permitted to bring firearms here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Draft regulation 7 therefore, requires a prospective visitor from the Community either to produce his European firearms pass or to show that he is exempt from the need to have one when applying for a visitor's permit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Draft regulation 6 provides that the holder of a visitor's shotgun permit who is a resident of another Community state cannot purchase or acquire in Great Britain a shotgun with a magazine to take home with him unless he has a licence issued by the Department of Trade and Industry authorising him to remove the gun from Great Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Draft regulation 8 requires a resident of another Community state to have the equivalent of an article 7 authority issued by his own domestic authorities to buy firearms here. Again, as a result of a United Kingdom initiative, the 12 Community states have agreed on a common format for the article 7 authority. That will make it easier for a registered firearms dealer to recognise an article 7 authority issued by another Community state when a resident of that state seeks to buy firearms from him here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Draft regulation 9 implements the directive's requirement that a resident of one Community state who purchases or acquires certain firearms in another Community state should inform his own domestic authorities of the purchase or acquisition. Draft regulation 9 requires a British resident to inform his local chief officer of police of such a purchase or acquisition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The directive requires the Community state to set up an information exchange network to inform each other about transfers of firearms between their respective territories. Draft regulation 10 ensures that we will not be prevented by confidentiality obligations from supplying such information to other Community states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From that brief summary I hope that it will be clear that the draft regulations do no more than give effect to our Community obligations. We have consulted widely on our plans to implement the directive and I am glad to be able to say that both the police and the shooting community have welcomed the way in which we have approached the matter. I ask the Committee to support the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.39 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Cook. Having worked with you in the Opposition Whips' Office, I am certain that you
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
will bring a firmness and clarity to the Committee's proceedings which will give our deliberations fresh authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate the Minister on his appointment, and welcome him to the Committee. I also congratulate him on his gallop through the form of the regulations, although I think that we must study their content with care and ask for explanations on a number of points. For example, was choosing the name day of the patron saint of shooters significant, or was it merely a way of telling us what the date was? I accept the hon. Gentleman's point that the intention of the regulations is not controversial, but the matters which they seek to govern are important and, to some extent, controversial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said in his introduction that improvements had been won by the United Kingdom in the course of discussions with our European partners. Will he explain exactly what he means by improvements, because I suspect that one person's improvement is another's relaxation? The Minister will be aware that doubts have been expressed. A recent article in 
	<i>Everywoman</i> magazine suggested that the Home Office has given in to pressure not to be too stringent and, indeed, to relax its approach to firearms regulation which was strongly supported on both sides of the House following various incidents, not least the horrific shooting in Hungerford.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The explanatory memorandum makes considerable reference to exemptions, an issue on which the Committee needs to be satisfied. Paragraph 4 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"collectors have had to be specifically exempted, where appropriate, from the requirements of the Regulations."</p></blockquote>
How will the Government ensure that those relaxations are not abused or misused? In relation to customs and police controls, how will the Government ensure that the regulations—or relaxations—are not used in the wrong way? In other words, how will this work in practice? It is not enough to see the code words of the regulations, and I shall come later to an example in which the wording does not seem to give us much assistance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The explanatory memorandum notes on regulation 3 refer to the fact that the prohibition of incendiary ammunition does not catch tracer ammunition. Will the Minister explain the implication of that? The notes on that regulation also state that collectors will be
	<br><blockquote><p>"able to continue to collect such items by having a special condition added to their firearm or shotgun certificates. Collectors of missiles for such ammunition will need to apply for a firearm certificate with the special condition on it."</p></blockquote>
Again, the intention is clear, but how will this work in practice? How can we be sure that these quite complex regulations cannot be breached in a damaging way?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the exemptions for ammunition, paragraph 17 of the notes says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"this exemption does not allow firearms dealers to trade generally in prohibited expanding ammunition and like missiles without the Secretary of State's authority but is restricted to allowing them to supply such ammunition and like missiles to exempted firearm certificate holders and to other firearms dealers who have this special condition and therefore are able to take advantage of this exemption."</p></blockquote>
The intention is clear, but how will the system be policed? As it is the Secretary of State's decision, will it be dealt with by the Government, or by local police forces? How will the system operate when the decision is made by the Secretary of State but, as I suspect, local chiefs of police are obliged to ensure proper enforcement? What will be the practical situation for police and customs officers?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0475">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
I have a particular difficulty with regulation 4. As the Minister explained in his introduction, the intention is clear, but the content is not. The notes on the regulations are a useful starting point because they say what the regulations are meant to say rather than what they seem to say to the casual, non-legal reader. Paragraph 19 says that regulation 4
	<br><blockquote><p>"Amends the criteria for grant of a firearm certificate in section 27 of the 1968 Act to provide that a person under eighteen is to be capable of having a good reason for possessing, purchasing or acquiring a firearm or ammunition only if he has no intention of using them for a purpose other than the authorised purposes."</p></blockquote>
How does one determine that a young person making an application has intentions as pure as the driven snow?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 20 deals with the corresponding amendment to section 28 of the 1968 Act. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(which preserves the existing burden of proof on the chief officer of police to be satisfied that the applicant does not have a good reason before he can refuse a certificate) in respect of an application by a person under the age of 18 a shotgun certificate."</p></blockquote>
There is good reason for us to probe the Minister about that and seek satisfaction about what is being done. How will the procedure work in practice and how will it resolve the problem? The problem was illustrated recently when a chief police officer declared himself outraged that he had no choice but to issue a shotgun certificate to a young person aged 10. That must cause anxiety. The public's reaction is that if the law requires that, it must be barking mad. I would not accuse the Minister of such insanity. I am sure that he wants regulations that will work in practice. Will he satisfy the Committee about the Government's intention and about how the system will work in practice?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 4(1) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) Where a person under the age of eighteen is entitled, as the holder of a certificate under this Act, to have a firearm in his possession, it is an offence for that person to use that firearm for a purpose not authorised by the European weapons directive."</p></blockquote>
I understand that—a person who has obtained a firearm for one purpose must not use it for an illegal purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 4(2) deals with special provision about firearm certificates and states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the purposes of subsection (1) above a person under the age of eighteen shall be capable of having a good reason for having a firearm or ammunition in his possession, or for purchasing or acquiring it,"—</p></blockquote>
and this is where I place the emphasis—
	<br><blockquote><p>"only if he has no intention of using the firearm or ammunition, at any time before he attains the age of eighteen, for a purpose not authorised by the European weapons directive."</p></blockquote>
Setting aside the fact that that seems to imply that it would be all right if such a person intends to use the firearm for those purposes after reaching the age of 18, which can hardly have been the draftsman's intention, the provision refers only to intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 4(3) refers to special provision about shotgun certificates and states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A person under the age of eighteen shall be regarded for the purposes of paragraph (b) of subsection (1A) above as not having a good reason for possessing, purchasing or acquiring a shot gun if it is his intention to use the shot gun, at any time before he attains the age of eighteen, for a purpose not authorised by the European weapons directive."</p></blockquote>
The problem is that if the person is under 18 and intends to use the shotgun for an illegal purpose when he is over 18, that will be all right. That cannot be the intention of those who drafted the directive. It also means that it will be virtually impossible to refuse an application. To be refused, a young person under 18 would have to knock on the door
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
of the chief constable of his area and say, "Please let me have a gun, I want to break the law with it." That cannot be the Minister's intention, but the Minister will have to satisfy us on precisely how the regulations will work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, under existing law, a chief constable has had to express outrage because his hands are tied over an application, the regulations will make it worse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wardle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To deal with that point, I wish to make it clear that a chief officer must be satisfied in his own mind. If he is not satisfied that someone under 18 will be able to use the firearm without danger to public safety or peace, he should refuse the application and he is empowered so to do. The idea that an officer would be outraged because he could not refuse an application does not tally with the law as it stands, and nothing in the regulations will change the law in that respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is interesting because such outrage has been expressed in the past and I am surprised that the Minister is not aware of the public comments that have been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing today with the specific words of the regulations and the Minister has to satisfy us on those. Regulation 4(3) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A person under the age of 18 shall be regarded for the purposes of paragraph (b) of subsection (1a) above as not having a good reason for possessing, purchasing or aquiring a shot gun if it is his intention to use the shot gun, at any time before he attains the age of 18, for a purpose not authorised by the European weapons directive'."</p></blockquote>
That wording gives no discretion to a police officer unless he knows that it is the intention of the young person to use the weapon for a purpose other than that authorised. That places a bizarre requirement on chief officers of police to read the minds of young people or on a young person intending to break the law to rush up to the chief constable and say so. The regulations do not allow any other interpretation. Therefore, in practice, that regulation will make little or no sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the original EC directive was introduced, a comment was made about the different definitions of weapons and firearms in the European directive and in British legislation. At the time, it was said that, for policing purposes, both operationally and administratively, the different definitions would cause problems. Can the Minister satisfy us that that has been taken into account in the regulations and that there is no likelihood of operational or administrative difficulties arising?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the question of the various degrees of vetting and registration required for dealers who handle different categories of weapons. Dealers' registers must be maintained under the directive, but what consideration has been given to the way in which dealers' registers are maintained in other European countries and the operational problems that may arise for the police and other regulatory authorities in this country who must ensure that the directive is observed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The transfer of firearms between member states includes mail order transactions. Will the Minister confirm whether that has been dealt with satisfactorily or tell the Committee how it will be dealt with under other subsidiary legislation? The directive provides that, if an individual state prohibits specific firearms, other states will not be able to authorise dispatch or transfer of that type of firearm to states having those prohibitions. The words "will not be able to" appear to cover all eventualities, but we want to be sure that the

regulations and the policing requirements, both in the United Kingdom and in other European countries, are completely satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 15 of the directive also places a duty on member states to intensify controls on firearm entry at external borders of the Community. Considerable concern has been expressed about the changes to customs arrangements that will come into effect next year. One example of that has already affected my constituency. In the next-door constituency of the hon. Member for the Vale of Glamorgan (Mr. Sweeney), the presence of customs officers at incoming flights at Cardiff airport has led to a grossly unsatisfactory situation. It is firearms, security and drugs matters, not people returning with however many bottles, that cause concern. Although firearms control is only part of the problem, I hope that the Minister will reassure us about the arrangements that are being made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is little point introducing the regulations unless they are adequately enforced, not just by local police forces, but, as this part of the directive makes clear, by an obligation on member countries to strengthen policing at points of entry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Wardle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way, but I am bound to say to him that we are debating the draft regulations. Virtually all his comments have been about United Kingdom law as it now stands yet nothing in European law empowers us to use the regulations as a vehicle by which to change UK law. If the hon. Gentleman wants to make representations on the wider issue there are other contexts in which he can do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, the Minister is mistaken. Article 15 of the European directive places on member states a duty to intensify controls on firearm entry at external borders of the Community. If that is not covered by the regulations—I do not see that it is—the Minister must explain why it has been omitted and how the Government intend to fulfil that duty. It is not enough for the Minister to say that it has not been dealt with. The Committee must consider the adequacy of the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The requirement on individual nations is to bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provision to comply with the directive before 1 January 1993. That is why we are debating the subsidiary legislation today, but questions also arise about the practical arrangements, which are an obligation under the directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, there is the question of arrangements for the transfer of information. When the directive was published and approved it was unclear whether responsibility for transfer of information would lie with central Government or with individual police forces. Will the Minister make absolutely clear with whom that responsibility will lie?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When a holder of a European pass enters another state for the purpose of hunting or target shooting, there will be no check on the appropriateness of the firearm that he uses for the land where he is shooting, nor will there be a requirement for security arrangements for storage of the firearms to be vetted. That point is not covered in the regulations and I should be grateful for the Minister's comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that the regulations are not controversial, and I think that he is right. Clearly, the European directive is intended to regulate properly the transfer and passage of firearms and ammunition in the new situation towards which we are moving. However, it is
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
the Committee's responsibility to be satisfied that the regulations are adequate. A reading of them suggests that there are a number of points, which I hope that I have enumerated satisfactorily, on which the Minister should satisfy the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wardle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raised many points. I remind the Committee that many of those were objections to the law as it stands and we do not have the power, under the European Communities Act 1972, to make amendments to existing law which are not required by the directive. Therefore, I shall confine myself to the points relating to the draft regulations. I shall, of course, take note of the other points raised by the hon. Gentleman and will write to him about them. But for the sake of brevity, I do not wish to detain the Committee beyond what should be in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that a criticism of the Chair?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wardle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is my interpretation of the matter. It is of course for you, Mr. Cook, to tell me what is and what is not in order. I shall simply try to deal with those matters which impinge directly on the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman spoke of changes achieved by the United Kingdom in the regulations, and improvements made. On the exemption for disguised firearms for collectors and museums, authorisation must be given by the local chief police officer, who must be satisfied that the collection is bona fide and that the owner can hold that disguised firearm without any danger to public safety or the police. Therefore, a specific judgment has to be made by the local chief of police.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another change, which was widely lobbied by shooters, concerned the exemption for expanding ammunition. Again, the local chief police officer will ensure that the exemption for shooters and dealers is at all times enforced. If a person needs a section 5 authority, he will have to apply to the Secretary of State, as is the case at present. When there is an exemption from the need to have the Secretary of State's authority, the local chief police officer will grant exemption by putting a condition on the dealer's certificate. Police and customs officers will regularly check dealers to ensure that the sale and transfer of such ammunition is to other exempted dealers or firearms certificate holders only.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman talked also about young people. I repeat that what he referred to is the law as it stands. I remind the Committee that in this country people aged over 15 and under 18 may own a shotgun, but they must satisfy the local chief police officer of their suitability to own such a firearm and the uses to which it will be put. The hon. Gentleman suggested that people may say that they will use the gun for a certain purpose and then use it for something quite different. That is a matter for the chief police officer's judgment. That is the case for any firearms certificate. Children under the age of 15 cannot own but may use shotguns provided that they are supervised by a properly authorised person.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the Minister's comments. He appears to intend something different in the regulations from what he has said. It is not a matter of whether the chief police officer is satisfied but whether he has reason to be dissatisfied. The wording of regulation 4(2) and (3) shows that that is where the burden of satisfaction lies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wardle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman clarifies his point, but that is how the law stands and nothing in the regulations changes it. I made that point earlier, but I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for clarifying that detail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for accepting my clarification. As he appears to recognise that the law as it stands is unsatisfactory and that it cannot be changed by statutory instrument, does he intend to change the law?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wardle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not what I said. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman does not intend to mislead the Committee. I simply wished to say that the hon. Gentleman had recorded that the law as it stands requires the chief police officer to make a judgment. If the hon. Gentleman has a view on the law as it stands, he can make representations, write to me and consult the firearms consultative committee, which, as he knows, is made up of representatives of the Home Office, chief police officers and shooters. Nothing in the regulations bears on what the hon. Gentleman described. I shall be happy to write to the hon. Gentleman on the other points that he raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also mentioned tracer shotgun cartridges which were previously used by the military for training in shooting at moving targets such as aircraft and moving vehicles. For that training, clay pigeons and shotguns were used and as a result those cartridges are now used by shooters for sporting purposes. An exemption in respect of that has been introduced and included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman wishes to develop his thoughts on changing the firearms law, he should make representations. I commend the regulations to the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is my first experience in Committee and I am not sure about procedure, but if I transgress, I am sure that I shall be told.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point relates to regulation 4 and was alluded to in detail by my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael). Will the Minister clarify the purpose of the phrase in regulation 4(2)
	<br><blockquote><p>"at any time before he attains the age of eighteen"?</p></blockquote>
That is a variation on existing law. It clouds the issue and could be deleted without injury to the section's purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wardle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall happily write to the hon. Gentleman to clarify the precise interpretation of the regulation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Dudley Smith 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Warwick and Leamington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following on from what my hon. Friend the Minister said, I detect a far more rigourous approach by chief constables to the granting of shotgun licences because of the events of the past few years. That applies to older people as well as younger people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the regulations, which will allow reasonable people to operate and which have an anti-criminal element, but I am afraid that crime is constantly burgeoning, not only in this country but on the continent. Most of the weapons employed in crime are not obtained from individuals or through burglaries from houses, but from other directions. It is important to try to stop further criminality, but the regulations are only a small point because villains throughout the continent still seem to be able to obtain quite sophisticated weapons relatively easily.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wardle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with my hon. Friend. The point that he made at the outset of his remarks, about chief police officers being more stringent in recent years in view of the number of unhappy incidents, is correct. There is no distinction between someone who is under 18 applying and someone over that age applying. The chief police officer has a vested interest in ensuring that holders will be thoroughly responsible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To save himself a letter and to save the hon. Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Dowd) the trouble of opening one, the answer to the point that he raised is that it may be that someone under the age of 18 is issued a certificate, but the life of that certificate extends beyond that person's 18th birthday. If the hon. Gentleman is in any doubt at all, I shall write to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his reply, although it was somewhat brief in view of the issues raised. I look forward to receiving the detailed and considered response that he has promised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Warwick and Leamington (Sir Dudley Smith) was right to refer to the more stringent approach by chief constables. That approach will be approved by all of us. Our job this morning has been to examine the regulations to ensure that they will enable chief constables and others concerned to be fair, firm and stringent. We need to be sure that the regulations will not weaken the ability of the police to deal with problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I look forward to the Minister's explanation of my reference to the age of 18, which was reinforced by my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, West. The interpretation that can be put on the wording is that somebody under 18 could be given a certificate with a life that goes beyond the age of 18, but once that person reaches the age of 18, the suggestion is that there is less strict regulation on the uses to which the weapon can be put. If that is the case, we need an explanation. I am happy to await the Minister's detailed response, and I am sure that my hon. Friend will also look forward to it. I can assure him that opening one more letter from the Minister explaining that point will be a pleasure not a burden.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wardle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The whole point is that, by definition, after the age of 18, the restrictions implied by the regulations no longer apply to persons past their 18th birthday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that it is as clear as that. I look forward to hearing specifically from the Minister on which aspects are not regulated, and in which situations as the 18th birthday morning dawns, additional liberties are suddenly granted to the young person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must give us some explanations of the context of the regulations, in particular regulation 4.I am not satisfied with the phrasing of that regulation. To say that the wording of a regulation does not make sense because the law does not make sense is not satisfactory. The Minister has not given us a satisfactory explanation of how the regulation will apply. He must do so. It is regrettable that he has not been able to do so this morning, but I look forward with interest to his response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, given the shortness of time to the date when the regulations will be required and the Minister's positive intention, we are happy to agree that we have considered the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Keith Speed 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ashford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth said, the regulations are important. They will apply to visitors to and from countries in the European Community. My constituency and that of my hon. Friend the Minister are close to the continent and receive many weekend visitors. What is being done by way of publicity and promulgation, so that all concerned throughout the Community know precisely what is happening. Time is short, as the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth remarked, and we have only about eight weeks before the regulations come into effect for all visitors. I am not so concerned about this country, where we have a good sector of gun clubs, but some Community countries, whose citizens may be visiting my constituency and that of my hon. Friend, may not be so well organised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wardle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Reverting for a moment to the point raised by the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth, the regulations are self-explanatory on the point made by the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Lewisham, West. I think that the majority of the Committee see it that
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
way. However, I am more than happy to write and spell the matter out to him if that is not how he sees it. I have sought to cover the changes in the regulations brought about by United Kingdom initiatives and they are the key ones. The regulations as a whole are not controversial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ashford (Sir K. Speed) asked about publicity. Leaflets will be produced and distributed via chief police officers. Certificate holders, dealers, shooters and anyone else with an interest in these matters will receive leaflets which spell out precisely what the changes will entail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
