	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suggest that it will be for the convenience of the Committee to discuss at the same time the draft International Development Association (Fourth Replenishment: Interim Payments) Order. The Questions will, of course, be put to separate votes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of Overseas Development (Mrs. Judith Hart)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the draft instrument.</p></blockquote>
It will be certainly for my convenience, Mr. Fitch, if I may discuss both orders together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will realise that, although the discussion this morning is technical and my duty is to explain the technicalities, what we are talking about is of the most profound significance to the poorest countries, particularly in the Commonwealth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both draft orders would be made under Section 1(5) of the Overseas Aid Act 1968. If it proved possible for the main order to be made at an early date because the fourth replenishment of the resources of the International Development Association had become effective as planned, the need to make the interim payments order would fall away. I shall return to the question of the need for the interim order, but must first briefly explain the fourth replenishment itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As hon. Members will know, the IDA is the affiliate of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the World Bank, which provides credit for development projects on concessionary terms to the poorest of the developing countries, which would find great difficulty in servicing a large external debt on conventional or near conventional terms. This means that the IDA's re-
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
sources must themselves be provided on a concessional basis, whereas those of the IBRD itself are provided mainly through market borrowings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the IDA began operations in 1960, most of its funds have been provided by its Part I members, that is, the 19 richest countries which can offer their contributions in a convertible form, at roughly three-year intervals. Thus, the second replenishment was to cover the IDA programme from mid-1968 nail mid-1971, and the third from mid-1971 until now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The need for a further replenishment from the middle of 1974 was foreseen at the 1972 annual meeting of the board of governors, and subsequent discussions between member countries and the IDA, as the right hon. Member for Bridlington (Mr. Wood) is aware, as he was the Minister involved at the time, resulted in an agreement announced at Nairobi in September 1973 that countries would, subject to the approval of legislatures where necessary, provide $4,500 million for commitment in a three-year period from July 1974.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 21st January this year the right hon. Gentleman laid Cmnd. Paper 5525 before the House that described the detailed proposals for the replenishment. It proposed an increase to $4,500 million compared with the $2,400 million of the third replenishment. This is an increase fully justified by the growing needs of the poorer developing countries for aid on a concessional basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be apparent that in the interval since the replenishment was determined its value in real terms has been eroded by inflation, and at the same time the needs of the poorest countries for concessional funds have seriously increased because of changes in world economic factors, in particular, the effect of increased oil prices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Command Paper shows, the United Kingdom share of the $4,500 million would be about 11 per cent. of the total—precisely, in amount, £206,464,680. After the United States and Germany, ours is the third largest share. The United States' share, at one-third, would still be the largest though it represented a smaller percentage than its 40 per cent. of the third replenishment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0460">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
It will be noted that this time the draft orders are expressed in sterling and not as the equivalent of sums of United States dollars. This is because for this replenishment, unlike its precedessors, there is to be no maintenance of value obligation, a decision taken in view of the uncertainties and unsettled nature of international monetary conditions that prevailed when the replenishment was decided on. As a result, members would provide a stated amount of their own currency without any obligation to maintain the value of those payments subsequently, should there be a significant change in the exchange value of their currency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United Kingdom, whatever the Government of the day, has played a leading part in the replenishment of IDA resources. Indeed, I remember my own anxiety at the Ministry in 1969–70 to ensure that the third replenishment proceeded successfully. The right hon. Member for Bridlington also has been anxious that the fourth replenishment would succeed. I am sure that the House will wish to approve our participation in this latest one, and will agree that every effort should be made to increase the flow of concessional aid, to enable the IDA to play its own special and crucial role in the combined efforts of national and international bodies to help countries with their formidable short- and longterm economic difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our contribution to the IDA is, I believe, generally rated as being the most important element in the multilateral aid that we provide for development. I regard it as one of the most crucial elements in the assistance that we give, particularly to the poorest countries. I should say, too', that there is a close relevance to Commonwealth countries in the matter. They are among those most seriously affected by the oil crisis and oil prices. The IDA will undoubtedly continue to be an important source of aid for them. For example, since the IDA began operations, about 45 per cent. of IDA credits have been provided to India and Bangladesh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once the House has approved the first of these orders, we shall be able to inform the IDA that we are prepared to make our contribution and subscription to the fourth replenishment when we become bound to do so by the terms of
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
the resolution establishing the replenishment. This will mean that, once the replenishment is effective, we shall make contributions in three annual November instalments, in the form of promissory notes which will be encashed over a period as and when money is actually needed in the IDA's operations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The replenishment cannot become effective, however, until, as the White Paper sets out, l2 Part I members whose contributions and subscriptions aggregate $3,500 million have formally notified the IDA that they will make their agreed payments. The latter provision means that the replenishment cannot become effective until the United States has undertaken to make its agreed contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here I want to explain the nature of the difficulties which have surrounded the replenishment in terms of the United States contribution. Hon. Members will be aware that, for one reason or another—which it would be wise not to go into in too much depth this morning—the United States found it impossible to ratify the earlier replenishments by their due dates, and interim arrangements had to be made until it could complete the necessary legislative action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In January this year, however, the United States House of Representatives actually rejected a Bill which would have paved the way for the United States to participate in the fourth replenishment. The United States administration said that it had every intention of overcoming this legislative setback, and we have all been delighted to see that last week the House of Representatives passed the Bill by a substantial majority, the Senate having passed it by a large majority on 28th May. But the 'decision in the House of Representatives last week is very important and encouraging.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there were amendments to the Bill in both the Senate and the House of Representatives which will have to be reconciled in terms of United States legislative procedure by a Congress Committee. Apart from this—because one does not know what will occur in the remainder of the United States processing—it would be unrealistic to assume, in view of the precedent of the earlier replenishments, that the United States will be in a position to offer its contribution until an actual first appropriation has been
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0461">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
made by Congress, or appropriate Congressional assurances that it will be, have been obtained. In any case, the replenishment will not have been made effective by the due date, which has now been extended until 31st December 1974.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We and other Part I members are very concerned, particularly since the IDA, which, as was forecast, has now committed all its available resources, that the association should have the power to sanction new credits in the period before the replenishment becomes fully effective in terms of the procedures in the United States. We must not run the risk of the IDA not being in a position to make new credits, particularly at this difficult time for the poorest countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From discussions we have had with other member countries, it is clear that sufficient advance contributions should be forthcoming to keep the IDA going until the replenishment becomes fully effective. There now seems good reason to believe that it will become effective, though later than had been hoped and planned for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have, therefore, to explain the second order, the interim payments order. This would allow us to join with others and the IDA in an interim arrangement. The interim payments order seeks the approval of the House for, in effect, up to one-third of our proposed contribution and subscription, and we shall formally bind ourselves to contribute anything within this sum of about £68 million only when we are satisfied that a sufficient number of other countries have taken similar action to enable them to pledge advance contributions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, we shall be acting together with other Part I countries in making interim payments. As I said, the indications are that such support will be forthcoming, so that the board of directors of the IDA will be able to establish an interim replenishment which will enable it to carry on its essential work. If, at the end of the day, we have the approval of the House, and provided we are satisfied that other major donors will also make interim contributions, we shall inform the IDA of our support for an interim period to enable its programme to continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then, in November this year, when the first instalment of our contribution to a
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
full replenishment would have become due, we shall deposit the necessary promissory notes. Any such payments will, of course, be offset against the full amount for which we shall be committed once the full replenishment arrangements have become effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that is clear. It is somewhat technical but it is my duty to explain fully to the Committee the nature of the technicalities. I feel sure that all hon. Members will wish to speed these two orders on their way to help ensure continuity in the lending programmes of the IDA over the next three-year period. As I said at the beginning, the IDA is giving increasing emphasis to the poorest countries and to the sectors in those poorest countries which are of greatest importance to the most needy people in those countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Behind all the technicalities lies the major element in our provision of multilateral aid, and it will benefit the poorest countries and the poorest people in those countries. Thus, from the point of view of our own philsophy of aid, behind the technicalities lies something of tremendous substance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.47 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Wood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the right hon. Lady for her very clear explanation of what I have always found, and still find, a complicated subject. I think she will agree with me that it is a frustrating subject, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After the right hon. Lady's explanation, I am sure it would be right for the Committee to decide that it has considered the orders. It does not seem to be a very ambitious procedure for the Committee, but this is a step in the right direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Lady has made perfectly clear that I am irrevocably committed, and glad to be so, to the consideration of these orders. The White Paper which she has mentioned—the report of the executive directors—was published the same day as, or the day after, I told the House of Commons that the United Kingdom governor would vote for the resolution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 28 of the main report outlines the conditions for implementing the fourth replenishment which the right hon. Lady has explained to us today and, by implication, it also suggests the reason
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0462">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
for the interim payments order authorising payment of up to one-third of our total contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was convinced when I was Minister by the arguments which were put before me at the end of last year that, without such an interim contribution in the circumstances in which we still found ourselves, new lending by the IDA would grind to a halt just about in July 1974. Had I remainded at the Overseas Aid Administration, now the Ministry of Overseas Aid, I should certainly be putting forward the proposal that we are now considering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a similar but not exactly identical procedure to that which I adopted in relation to the third replenishment. The change that the right hon. Lady has made—perhaps she would say a word about this—is that the interim payment is now offered in one tranche rather than in two halves, which was the method that I chose in 1972. But, as she has made clear, this is a matter which depends on the dates. The 1972 contribution was made in July and November. This time the contribution will be payable once, in November. If that is the case, this is entirely satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the delicacy of going too deeply into the question of which Part I members will do likewise with ourselves, and we must put our trust in the right hon. Lady to satisfy herself that a satisfactory number of Part I members were prepared to take this action, and that we would not take such action on our own, or even supported by a few, but should obtain solid support before taking action. I understand that that is her intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Lady has said as much as she can about the intentions of the United States Government, which are so important in this matter. This has continued to be a worrying business for a great many of us, both in Britain and in the United States. It is a measure of the immense dependendence of the Development Assistance Committee, and of the developing countries, on the United States and of the enormous contribution which the United States has made since the war, that all our plans can be disrupted by a delay in the ratification of this kind of agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
I do not expect the right hon. Lady to say much at this time, but I think it important that she should be considering the action she will take if the ratification of the agreement continues to be delayed by the United States.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a question which is perhaps not strictly in order on these orders, except that the right hon. Lady mentioned IDA lending as being the most important multilateral contribution that we make. With this agreement in mind, can she say what percentage of our aid programme is now going through multilateral channels?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think I have said enough to make clear my complete sympathy with the right hon. Lady's objectives. As she well knows, I have not always been in such complete sympathy with all her views, but during the three and a half years that I was in her office I became more and more convinced, as she is, of the value of the contribution made by the IDA. There will in the future be a very large number of necessary development projects which are too big for the resources of any one nation. It could be that a consortia of donors would sometimes provide the necessary funds, but I formed the view that the IDA was becoming even more essential to development as the years went by.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should, therefore, like to congratulate the right hon. Lady and Her Majesty's Government on the action now proposed to see that the association's work in the future is not frustrated by lack of the necessary resources. I hope that my hon. Friends will agree to the consideration of these orders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.54 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. R. B. Cant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the first meeting of a Statutory Instruments Committee that I have attended, but I was pleased to discover that general aspects of a problem were capable of being discussed, as distinct from dotting the "i"s and crossing the "t"s of the instrument under consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point I should like to ask my right hon. Friend relates to the change in the denomination of the loan from dollars to pounds. I wonder whether my right hon. Friend can give the reasons for this, but, more particularly, whether she can say whether any estimate has bene made of the possible or prospective decline in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0463">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
real value of the aid, because, although we all belong to the Club of 19, we are slipping slightly, and the rate of inflation in this country is likely to be considerably higher than that in the United States, for example. To take a cynical view, we might have adopted the pound as the measure of the value of our aid because we fed that this will let us off a little more lightly. As one who believes strongly in aid, I think that we should be told a little about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the same context, I wonder whether my right hon. Friend can say something about the relative position of recipient countries in relation to the benefits that they have gained—which may be outside the context of this mornings' discussion—from the boom in commodity prices, as against the losses that they will sustain as a consequence of the enormous increase in oil prices.. If the answer is that relatively they will suffer, I think that we should perhaps treat more seriously the question of denominating our aid in terms of pounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, I understand that this is multilateral aid which is going to particular sectors, and therefore the poorest people in the countries and communities are helped. To what extent—this is purely a search for information—do we, when giving aid, for example, to India, make the rather critical comment that, while we are anxious and willing to give aid, we are a little surprised that a poor country finds it possible to devote such a high proportion of its resources to the development of nuclear fission and such things?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.57 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Marshall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my right hon. Friend the Member for Bridlington (Mr. Wood) in complimenting the right hon. Lady on a very clear statement, and in supporting the general agreement of the Committee about the value of these instruments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I ask the right hon. Lady one short question? I should like to say that some of us, from the work which we are doing in the Select Committee on Overseas Development, would fully support all that she has said about the value of the IDA as a continuing instrument in helping especially those countries most affected by the current oil crisis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
I was interested in the right hon. Lady's reference to India and Bangladesh, which receive 45 per cent. of current loan aid through IDA. As the third highest contributor to IDA, to what extent can we keep that emphasis and help in the forefront of IDA thinking in respect of those most affected countries? I should appreciate some guidance as to how the right hon. Lady feels that our role in IDA is being maintained and strengthened by these statutory instruments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful for the support that the Committee is giving to the consideration of these orders, and I shall do my best to answer the various points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take, first, the right hon. Gentleman's question of one tranche or two. I think that the right hon. Gentleman himself put his finger on the answer—it is related to the particular timing on this occasion. He asked the difficult question as to what the position would be if the United States, at the end of the day, continues to delay ratification because of problems in Congress. I can only say to him at this stage that, were such a situation to arise it would, of course, be very serious, and I have no doubt at all—the right hon. Gentleman will understand that I cannot say more than this—that the Part I members would want to consider very seriously what they should do in such a situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The structure of the constitution of the IDA is such that it would present a serious position but, on the other hand, the IDA is of such enormous importance that I do not think one could easily contemplate allowing total disaster to overtake it. I hope that situation will not arise. There is every hope that at the end of the day there will be ratification in time for everything to proceed in an orderly way.

One point arises here in relation to the last question of the hon. Member for Arundel (Mr. Marshall) about India and Bangladesh. It relates also to the points put by my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, Central (Mr. Cant) about the relevance of the Indian nuclear technology activities. What has happened in the House of Representatives is that in passing the legislation last week an amendment was passed that the United

States should vote against any IDA lending to any country which had not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Therefore, the position in relation to India is rather difficult. I hope that that can be solved, too, in one way or another. I am sure that members of the Committee would want to know the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not recently had occasion to ask for the precise figure for the percentage of multilateral aid and I think it is just about where it was when the right hon. Gentleman left the Department, or will be as the result of this IDA intention. My hon. Friend asked me about the expression of the new replenishment in pounds rather than in dollars. I tried to explain that this was not so much because contributors were wanting to make an effective reduction in the amounts that they were pledging but simply because of the uncertainties and because people have to be certain in relation to what they ask their own Parliaments to agree to and to be certain of what figure it is that their Parliaments are ratifying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Supposing that today's figure had been expressed in dollars a year ago, then the figure that was approved in the end by the House of Commons would not be the figure that was actually spent because of the change in currency value. So the purpose is to establish a degree of certainty rather than attempt to make any real reduction in what is provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can answer my hon. Friend's question about the effect of inflation on the amounts that are now being pledged. Broadly, although the actual figures are larger for this fourth replenishment, it is probably the case that in effective terms at constant prices this fourth replenishment is unlikely to be any higher than the third replenishment. It is just about standing still.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One further point was put to me by my hon. Friend on the position of the main recipient countries in terms of the effect on them of increasing commodity prices which they receive for their exports and the effect on them of the increased prices of oil which they import.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I can only put this in broad and general terms, what it amounts to is this. The poorest countries which are hardest hit by the oil prices are those which have benefited least from the high
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
commodity prices. Therefore, when one takes the two factors into account, one finds that India and Bangladesh have a desperate position to meet. The danger is that substantial elements of their own development plans will have to be seriously postponed simply in order to cope with the increased oil prices. Even to do that there will need to be a considerable inflow of external resources to meet the critical position that they will face during the next six months and the years to come.

I hope I am not stretching the bounds of order too much, Mr. Fitch, but I will take only a sentence or two over this. That is why it is of the greatest importance that there should be a full response to the United Nations appeal for special funds to assist. It is also why there is grave concern that there is this possible problem, which I hope will be overcome, of United States Congress aid to India.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot pretend that we consider these orders in an atmosphere in which we can hope that the developing countries will make enormous progress in the next year. They will not. The poorest of them will be very lucky if they just hold their own in the next year. But that means that our own aid programme, and whatever expenditure we can undertake, are the more relevant and the more important. But it is not a reassuring and happy atmosphere at this stage; it is a pretty desperate one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am certain, particularly in the light of that situation, that the House will at the end of the day give approval to what we are doing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
