	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. John Morris)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee have considered the Matter of Agriculture and Rural Affairs in Wales.</p></blockquote>
I am sure, Mr. Davies, that in due course you will be reminding the Committee of the need for brevity to ensure that as many as possible right hon. and hon. Members can catch your eye. That is my aim and I hope to fulfil it, and I shall start by being as brief as I can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My first happy duty is to welcome my hon. Friend the Minister of State for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to this Committee. As a Scotsman and an old friend of many of us, he is very welcome. I am not sure what sort of welcome a Welshman would get in a Scottish Grand Committee, but nevertheless he is welcome in our midst.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a departmental Minister in the Department whose head is jointly responsible with me for agriculture in Wales, I know that my hon. friend will make a most valuable contribution in winding up our discussion if he catches your eye, Mr. Davies, at the appropriate time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a very long time since this Grand Committee turned its attention to the state of agriculture in Wales and rural affairs generally. It is within the recollection of many hon. Members how we sought in opposition, particularly at the turn of the year, to get agriculture debated: to no avail. It was obvious then that difficulties were being stored up for the farming industry. There were clear signs of existing problems and of further troubles ahead. In these circumstances, one need not be surprised that we were not able to get a debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever the difficulties of agriculture today and there are difficulties, and there is deep concern, particularly in the livestock sector they do not stem from the decision of the nation on 28th February
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
to turn out the previous Government and leave us to pick up the pieces and get the nation back to work. This has been recognised by representatives of the industry, who, in expressing their complaints about the existing situation, have emphasised that their origins stem from the decisions and activities, or perhaps the inactivity, of our predecessors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When on taking office I had to decide which matters within my field of responsibility I would deal with directly myself and which I would allocate to my two ministerial colleagues, it was of course natural for me as Secretary of State to choose agriculture as one of the subjects I would handle personally. Because of the depth of my farming background, of which I am very proud, I am sure that the industry would have expected nothing else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It goes without saying that I have a deep conviction of the importance of the industry to Wales, which Alun Mabon described as "crefft gyntaf dynol ryw". If I may translate words which are familiar to so many members of the Committee and to the Ministry of State—the first craft of mankind. Nevertheless, while it is crucial to the prosperity of a great deal of rural Wales, it cannot be the sole answer to its future. Agriculture cannot operate without vital services, and I believe that the problems of rural Wales demand a comprehensive approach. It is our duty to ensure both agricultural prosperity and balanced economic development in other respects so that there will continue to be a living and vital community in the heart of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My first job as Secretary of State was to open up the channels of communication between the Government and the industry in Wales. Very early on, in the first few weeks, I met the Welsh Council of the National Farmers' Union. In Foreign Office terms, if a diplomatic communique were issued, it would have said in those early days "a full and frank discussion took place ". It certainly was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Soon afterwards, the leaders of the Farmers' Union of Wales called to see me at my agricultural Welsh Office at Aberystwyth, and they made their views equally clear. Since then, the Welsh Labour Group has been to see me, and I went again to Trawscoed to meet the Ministry's regional panels, consisting of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0399">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
representatives from both sides of the industry in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The picture that they painted to me was depressing. Point after point of difficulty was discussed, although there was, as in most agricultural discussions —and I have taken part in many over a period of twenty years—an element of exaggeration and of special pleading. Nevertheless, I recognised the deep anxiety of the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I contrasted this with the high expectations that we had when we entered the EEC, certainly with the "full-hearted consent" of the British agricultural industry. At that time, both in our speeches and in our publications, many of us on this side of the House gave a solemn warning to agriculture in Wales, but it was not heeded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My sympathies go out to the industry now that it has realised, late in the day, that the streets of Brussels are not paved with gold. It is not agriculture's fault: the responsibility lies with the right hon. and hon. Members opposite to whose siren voices the industry listened and who swallowed a common agricultural policy and turned a deaf ear over many months to the industry's pleas for help to offset rising costs. That did not occur only on 28th February. Rising costs, as hon. Members will recall, were the main topic of conversation at last year's Royal Welsh Show and earlier—certainly for those who visited the show in July.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, the sharpest anxieties are in the livestock sector, particularly among beef and pig producers. Hon. Members know, however, that the sheep sector of the industry has been remarkably bouyant and I dare say prosperous. My well-informed spies tell me that "we live on the sheep ". That is their comment and criticism of the livestock sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The industry has moved from the guarantee system to the more complex support systems of the EEC. On taking office, although the annual review had been completed and the determinations made, we were faced with the problem of making a settlement in the EEC farm price negotiations which would meet the needs of our producers and consumers: although I know that many livestock producers were hoping for, indeed expect-
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
ing, a higher beef price, consumers had already shown that they were not prepared to pay high prices, and therefore it was important to encourage a price level that would keep beef within the limits of the housewife's purse. To have done otherwise clearly would not have been in the consumers' interest; nor would it have been—I think that this should be recognised—in the producers' long-term interests. I know the producers and the long-term problems that they face.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also avoided permanent intervention by taking meat off the market, a system that was designed to maintain consumer prices. At the same time, we recognised the producers' needs by increasing the subsidies which our livestock sector received in direct aids and which was not available to producers in other member States of the EEC. In Wales alone these aids will amount to about £11 million per year. I am sure this was a wise decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognise that the £10 per head increase in the calf subsidy, negotiated as part of the agreement on EEC farm prices, will not solve the immediate difficultits of all sectors of the beef industry. So, too, do we recognise the desire of producers for a greater degree of confidence in the beef sector and we all know that this part of the industry is one that demands a certain degree of confidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At this point I should like to ask hon. Members opposite what they would have done. The common agricultural policy has just not worked and its intervention policy in Europe in creating a beef mountain some of which may end up by being sold off at our expense to third countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Anthony Meyer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether hon. Members opposite would have advocated intervention buying in this country, bearing in mind our limited storage capacity, in order to keep prices up, thus risking a repetition of the consumer resistence which has been experienced in the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir Anthony Meyer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the right hon. and learned Gentleman saying that the whole of what amounts to two days supply of beef in cold storage is a shortsighted policy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0400">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that this is a double-sided coin. If we were to store with our limited storage capacity, even though there have been advocates of that course, its effect would be minimal on prices in this country. Is the hon. Gentleman seriously advocating that substantial storage facilities be created to put first class quality beef into storage, which does not come out in the quality that it is put in, in order to keep prices up to consumers? That is a policy which has not worked. We saw what happened as regards butter only a short time ago when it was disposed of to third countries at lower prices. That is an indication of how well this kind of policy which was advocated works. During the course of this debate I should be interested to know how hon. Members opposite, had they been returned to office on 28th February, would have tackled the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are most conscious that pig producers have been facing considerable difficulties for some time, and it is right to recognise these matters. I am fully aware of the problems of livestock producers. That is why my hon. Friend the Minister of State and I, conscious as we are of these problems, knowing that we are part of the EEC, are concerned to ensure that our negotiations are conducted in such a way as to bring the maximum of benefit both to our producers and to our consumers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was because we were conscious of the difficulties faced by pig producers that we arranged for a special subsidy to be paid to them from 25th March. This subsidy represents a major move towards helping pig producers in their difficulties. But, until the market for pigs shows the improvements that we expect, the immediate situation for many producers must remain one of great difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, this special aid, coupled with a price reduction of up to £2 to £3 per ton for many pig feeds, which com-pounders have recently announced, should bring considerable relief to weaner pig producers in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend yesterday outlined to his ministerial colleagues in the Council of Ministers the ways in which we should like to see the Community's common agricultural policy altered so that it may be developed into a more
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
effective system of support. All this, of course, is part of a continuing process of negotiation which this Government are pursuing vigorously. The changes which we wish to bring about in the operation of the CAP cannot be achieved immediately, but we are nevertheless determined to bring the matter to a satisfactory conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will, of course, have seen reports in this morning's papers about the outcome of discussions in the Council of Ministers in Luxembourg. My right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture will be making a statement on these discussions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roy Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my right hon. and learned Friend leaves the point on the common agricultural policy, bearing in mind the fundamental criticism which has been made this morning of that policy obtaining in the Common Market, will he tell us whether the changes which he considers necessary are compatible with the Treaty of Rome as it stands at present? Would he not agree that fundamental amendments are needed to that treaty?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend knows, my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture is pursuing his negotiations, which began early on in the life of this Government. I understand that he is on his way back from Luxembourg at this moment and will shortly be making a statement to the House. He is pursuing those negotiations in the light of the policy upon which my hon. Friend and I fought the last election. I am confident that at the end of the day the results which he will obtain will bring satisfaction both to my hon. Friend and to myself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dafydd Wigley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have given way twice. I want to ensure that hon. Members on both sides can speak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Minister will be making a statement on these discussions and their special relevance to beef and pigs in the House this afternoon. I am sure members of the Committee will accept that it would be wrong for me to comment in advance on this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to some of the more general problems of rural Wales. A famous report in 1954 stated that in mid-Wales
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0401">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
depopulation was a form of economic adjustment. Those words are written on the hearts of many of us who hail from the heart of mid-Wales. I am determined to take the necessary steps to ensure that this process is permanently reversed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been taking a little time to ensure that the right machinery is devised to put into effect my policies. To be effective, the right policy must be acceptable. I regret very much the passing of the Rural Development Board and, because of this rejection, mid-Wales has lost a good deal of money which could have been injected into it. I want, however, to make it clear that I have no intention of resurrecting the past. Rather, want to build now for the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are, of course, firmly committed to a policy of comprehensive development in rural Wales and to the creation of the machinery need to bring this about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last Labour Government established the Mid-Wales Development Corporation and gave it the initial task of doubling Newtown's population. That Government also designated six other growth towns within which industrial and other development is being concentrated, and this itself will bring substantial benefits to neighbouring communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am, of course, only too well aware that progress in the growth towns, with the exception of Newtown, has been disappointingly slow. Factories have certainly been built. Jobs have been provided. But all too often it has proved impossible to build houses on the scale required and provide the associated facilities and services. We are, I believe, at a critical point today in rural Wales. Several of the growth towns are nearing the limit of their capacity to absorb factory developments, given their existing size. Henceforward it will be vital to ensure that labour supply grows in line with factory development. All this can be done only if there is a co-ordinated programme of industrial and housing development. Without this, the growth town policy just will not succeed.

The Committee will know that I came to office pledged to set up administrative machinery which will effectively ensure that the growth towns policy becomes a reality. In consultation with my ministerial colleagues I am considering very urgently what should be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
I think, however, I should sound one note of warning today. I sounded a number of notes of warning generally in the course of my speech when we discussed Welsh affairs on the Floor of the House. It may be that in this field, as in others, the very serious economic situation that faced us as a Government when we took office just over three months ago will limit the scope for action this year. It may be that we shall not immediately be able to do all that we would like. Those are the harsh economic realities of life today. But, having said that, let me again emphasise my firm intention to create the machinery which will make possible the vigorous development of rural Wales. In the meantime, it is vital that we keep up the momentum of industrial development, to the very limit of the growth towns' capacity to absorb new employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this connection, I am glad to be able to announce today two further advance factory building projects in the growth towns. A new 10,000 sq. ft. factory is to be built in Bala and a cluster of nursery units in Brecon. These developments will again be financed by the Development Commission. Coming, as they do, quickly after my announcement of new nursery units at Penrhyndeudraeth and a tenant for the vacant Blaenau Ffestiniog factory—I here pay tribute to the officers of my Department and those of the Department of Industry for the enormous work that was put in to ensure a tenant for this factory—they mark a further step forward in our efforts to inject new life into the growth towns and indeed into the areas as a whole, and as we said in our election document—that is our aim and that is our pledge—to
	<br><blockquote><p>"implement a co-ordinated strategy that will end the running sore of rural depopulation."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, should like to welcome the Minister of State to our deliberations here in the Welsh Grand Committee. I think that he will find that we are a very courteous body and that we certainly greatly appreciate visiting Ministers giving up their time in order to help us in our deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to start by congratulating the right hon. and learned Gentleman on fulfilling in part his expressed hope at the beginning of his speech that he would be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0402">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
brief. His speech was, indeed, quite short and I therefore hope that I shall emulate his example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. and learned Gentleman rightly talked about his association with agriculture in the past. He is by experience—having worked with a farmers' union—and by family association probably better qualified than most of us to speak on Welsh agriculture. That being so, it seems extraordinary that, despite paying lip service to the difficulties which undoubtedly exist in farming in Wales, he appeared to be totally remote from the true state of the farming industry in Wales today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was surprised to find that most of his speech was devoted to an apology for the Government's attitude towards the European Economic Community. There appeared to be a gesture of defiance to the farming community in Wales, who were chided for having in the past accepted that there would be benefits for them in the Community. I felt that was the wrong approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Eighty-five per cent. of Welsh agricultural gross output is produced in the livestock sector. A large part of that sector today finds itself in a situation which can be described without fear of exaggeration as disastrous. The right hon. Gentlemen may know that we had a Conservative conference at Llandrindod Wells on Saturday. The first debate was on agriculture, and many farmers spoke. I have rarely heard such anxieties expressed. Those anxieties were tinged with extreme bitterness. It is quite clear that the farmers in Wales are feeling very angry indeed. It seems that the right hon. and learned Gentleman has joined the rest of the Government in either failing to understand or, in his case, ignoring the magnitude of the problems the farmers and, ultimately, the consumers face.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Livestock farmers, particularly pig, beef and poultry producers, are now in a serious financial situation. Beef producers on present markets are losing between £25 and £35 on every animal marketed. Pig producers are losing £3 to £3.50 on every pig. Egg producers are losing 6p to 7p—and that is a conservative estimate for some people estimate that they are losing 10p—on every dozen eggs produced. Poultry meat producers
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
in the United Kingdom are losing about £¾million per week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the main, as the right hon. Gentleman knows, Welsh farms are small family farms with little capital backing to carry them through these difficulties. At the present time they are suffering a severe crisis. The result is that many are facing bankruptcy, the breeding stock is being depleted, slaughterings are taking place at a frightening rate, and eventually this will hit the consumer who, in due course, will have to pay more than ever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. and learned Gentleman said these problems did not begin on 28th February. Of course they did not. Enormous problems were produced by the unprecedented rise in the cereal prices last year, reaching their peak last October. Because of this, pig and dairy producers faced great hardship in the later months of 1973. That is why we as a Government brought forward the Annual Price Review by a full month. That is why we negotiated the biggest award ever on milk, £145 million, which was a substantial help, and saved what would have been a very serious situation for the dairy farmers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During that time, the end price of pigs hardened in October, November and December of 1973, but deteriorated in January. It was clear that there was a serious situation and that something had to be done about it. My right hon. Friend the Member for Grantham (Mr. Godber), who was then the Minister of Agriculture, was actively engaged in Brussels in securing a settlement that would have brought lasting relief to pig producers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course the right hon. and learned Gentleman is right: the problems existed on 28th February; but they were being tackled. I admit that we left unfinished business for the incoming Government, but our complaint is that that business has remained unfinished. It is all very well for the right hon. and learned Gentleman to try to create the impression that this problem has been caused by our membership of the Community, but that is totally wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The farmers know full well that there can be no doubt about what was the major factor causing today's crisis. It was the visit of the Minister of Agriculture to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0403">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
Brussels on 21st and 23rd March. I agree that the right hon. Gentleman was facing difficulties when he went to that meeting. He was hamstrung, as indeed is the right hon. and learned Gentleman, by his own and his party's attitude towards Europe. He was also hamstrung by their policy for cheap food and he was, therefore, in difficulty. But the package deal, which he negotiated at that meeting, has now been proved beyond doubt to have been disastrous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, he negotiated an increase of only 6.3 per cent. in the guide price for adult cattle; that included a transitional step. The rest of Europe increased prices by 12 per cent. and Ireland by 17 per cent. That has meant increased penalisation for United Kingdom exporters of beef, and increased subsidisation, in the form of transitional compensating amounts, for importers of beef from the EEC to the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can United Kingdom produced beef compete with that? Added to that, the Minister for Agriculture dealt a serious almost a death blow, to confidence: he took away all forms of market guarantee. We took away the deficiency payments guarantee on the clear commitment and understanding, accepted by the farmers, that it would be replaced by the Common Agricultural Policy guarantee. The Minister of Agriculture has now taken that away and, for the first time since 1947, there is no guarantee price for beef. The result of the right hon. Gentleman's negotiations in Brussels is lack of confidence and the undercutting of the market. What a contrast that is between the success that we had over the previous years of building up a national beef herd!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Norman Buchan)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret interrupting as my first intervention in this Committee. In the interests of greater accuracy, it would be useful if the right hon. and learned Gentleman would now finalise this section of his speech by telling us whether he would introduce intervention buying in this country. Secondly, would he please correct his statement that the taking away of the guarantee last year was backed by the farmers? It was not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: "Accepted" by the farmers was the word I used. When my right hon. Friend the Member for Grantham was negotiating at the time of the election, he was undoubtedly negotiating for an increase in the intervention price. If we had been returned to office, the farmers would have had an increase in the intervention price, not a decrease, and there would have been the intervention which would have given them a guaranteed position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. and learned Gentleman mentioned the increase in the calf subsidy from £8 to £18.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the right hon. and learned Gentleman clarify one matter? Is he or is he not in favour of intervention buying? Would that have been the policy of the Conservative Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The policy of the Conservative Government as the right hon. and learned Gentleman knows, was to renegotiate as a full member within the Community—not just for Britain but for all members of the Community—the common agricultural policy and the intervention policy which at that time was obviously one to be renegotiated. [	<i>Laughter</i>] It is one which would have been the subject of negotiation. But it is quite clear that the farmers in Britain knew that with the deficiency payment guarantee being removed, there had to be some guarantee in its place, and the intervention system afforded that guarantee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the right hon. and learned Gentleman wishes to interrupt me again he is quite at liberty to do so, but he will appreciate that I did not interrupt him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. and learned Gentleman mentioned the increase in calf subsidy and, very fairly, he said it would not solve the immediate difficulties in all sectors of beef subsidy. Of course that is perfectly clear. That calf subsidy applies only to calves born in the last six months. It gives no help whatever to farmers marketing animals today. Those farmers are losing £25 to £35 on every animal they market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Confidence has been totally lost, as is shown by the level of calf slaughtering, which is double last year's level. What is happening is that we are slaughtering our seed stock. It is plain that that can
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0404">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
lead only to shortages of home-produced beef in the coming months, and eventually to increased prices for the consumer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The truth is—the right hon. and learned Members cannot blame me for entering the party political arena—that the present Government, supported, I suspect somewhat reluctantly, by the right hon. and learned Gentleman, are playing politics with the nation's food supply. They are willing to allow the production of food in this country to decline in the interests of short-term political gain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. and learned Gentleman mentioned pigs. The situation for pig producers is as bad or even worse. The slaughtering of boars, sows and gilts has been increasing alarmingly. He mentioned the subsidy of 50p per live score. I acknowledge that that has been of help. I was glad to see yesterday that the intention is to extend it to September, but it is only a short-term measure and it has now been almost wholly eroded by further falls in the end price of pigs marketed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have the advantage of being sent a memorandum by the Farmers' Union of Wales. I thought I should read it, because I know that the right hon. and learned Gentleman would attach importance to the figures that the union gives. He will be interested to hear what this union said about the subsidy of 50p!
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is noticeable that, although sow and boar slaughterings dropped in the weeks following the implementation of the subsidy, they have increased since, and it can confidently be said that the breeding herd is now lower than at any previous point in the 1970s."</p></blockquote>
In that paragraph the document adds:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Weaners (young pigs sold for fattening) have not benefited at all, since fatteners have not been able to afford to pass any of it on to weaner producers."</p></blockquote>
As the right hon. and learned Gentleman knows, pig production in Wales, although small, is almost wholly geared to weaner production, and weaners have not benefited at all from the subsidy that he mentioned. There is no doubt that pig farmers in Wales are in dire financial straits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to this document, beef, milk, egg and pig farmers are losing money. There is a decline in their stock
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
numbers and in the breeding herd. The document states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This foreshadows lower herd numbers in the United Kingdom for some time to come, resulting in a shortfall in production."</p></blockquote>
This inevitably means that in a few months food prices will rise steeply, and that there will be
	<br><blockquote><p>"an increase in food imports of the order of tens, and soon hundreds, of millions of pounds. These trends are inevitable since the deterioration has already gone far. They can only be checked, and eventually reversed, if there is immediate Government action to prevent farmers' losses."</p></blockquote>
This is what the Farmers' Union of Wales says at the end of the summary:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Unless Government action is taken soon, 1974 will be a year of suffering for Welsh farmers. Twelve per cent. of farmers left the industry during 1973 in Wales, and present conditions can only aggravate the trend. In rural Wales it already seems inevitable that depopulation will increase and that personal incomes will fall considerably. The only certain way to prevent the further deterioration of the situation is for the Government to take action to ameliorate conditions in agriculture."</p></blockquote>
There is no doubt that action is needed to recreate the confidence that the industry so badly needs. It must be recreated if British consumers are to be protected from massive price increases in the coming months. The urgency of the situation cannot be overstated. The right hon. and learned Gentleman has spoken about his right hon. Friend's visit to Luxembourg and the statement that he will be making this afternoon. We await that statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have read the Minister of Agriculture's statement to the Council of Agricultural Ministers in Luxembourg yesterday and it is clear from it that he does not have any real answer to the present problem. I repeat that the awful truth is that this minority Socialist Government are playing fast and loose with the country's food supplies to achieve short-term political popularity. But it is only for the short term. In the near future the Government's present agricultural policy will mean shortages and high prices, and it is time that they realised that there are no supplies of cheap food available anywhere in the world and that it is of major national interest for Britain to produce as much home-grown food as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0405">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
The right hon. and learned Gentleman has joint responsibility for agriculture in Wales. I am glad that he is assuming that responsibility personally. He and his colleagues must act now to help livestock farmers, to stop the slaughterings and recreate the confidence that existed only a few months ago. That confidence took years to create; in a few months it has been destroyed. If the right hon. and learned Gentleman does not act quickly —and we pray that it is not already too late—rural Wales will suffer and the consumer will pay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Both right hon. and learned Members have anticipated the appeal I am now making to members of the Committee to observe brevity in their remarks, in order that 1 may call as many Members as possible during the sitting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cledwyn Hughes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is appropriate that we should be discussing agriculture in the Welsh Grand Committee this morning, and that for a number of good reasons. First, agriculture is the major industry in the majority of Welsh counties. Indeed, in the predominantly industrial areas of Glamorgan, Monmouth and Flint farming plays a significant role. The famous vales of Clwyd and Glamorgan have some of the best farms in Britain, and a prosperous agriculture is, therefore, crucial to the well-being of the total community in all those areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, Welsh farming is predominantly livestock in character. Cattle account for 62·2 per cent. of Welsh agricultural production and dairy farming alone accounts for more than one-third, 35·7 per cent.; sheep 16·2 per cent.; pigs 5 per cent. Cattle, sheep and pigs together comprise 83·4 per cent. of Welsh farm production. It is against that background that we have to consider our problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That leads me to my third point, namely, that if there is a crisis in the livestock sector, it hits Wales harder than any other part of the United Kingdom. Lastly, this debate is timely because my hon. Friend the Minister of State for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has just been meeting his colleagues in Luxembourg, and I shall turn to that later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two matters which should concern us this morning. They are the
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
short-term problem that faces the industry and the long-term policy that it needs if it is to make its contribution to the economy. The right hon. and learned Member for Hendon, South (Mr. Thomas) told the Committee what his Government might have done had they continued in office. I am bound to say that that does not carry much conviction. As he admitted, the problems had piled up pretty well by 28th February. But I do not propose to engage in recrimination. It is a sterile exercise that helps no one, least of all the farmer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said on the Floor of the House on 8th May, the present state of affairs is the result of a number of developments and I believe it to be the responsibility of this Committee to analyse the situation to see how these developments have come about. The first, and it has been referred to by my right hon. and learned Friend and by the right hon. and learned Gentleman, is our entry into the European Economic Community. I am not proposing to argue the merits or demerits of that at this time, but it meant that we abandoned the deficiency payments system, which had underpinned our markets since the war. Farming unions argued at the time for a long transitional period. They settled reluctantly for five years. There were meetings and arguments about the length of the transitional period at the time, and I remember the unions saying that they would like to have seven years or even more. But the fact is that events have overtaken us and the transitional period has become meaningless, a fact that Government and Opposition and farmers' representatives have to face.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second development is that the livestock farmer has come up against acute difficulties because of the disparity between the price he gets for his product and the price he has to pay for the grain and protein feed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, inflation has hit the farmer like everyone else in relation to the cost of feed, fertiliser, fuel and so on. The burden of increased costs that affects us as a nation, it is not a particularly Welsh or British phenomenon, but an international one, has been particularly heavy on the agricultural industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The charge is often made, and it is one that we should examine, that the unions have been exaggerating their difficulties
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0406">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
and helping to create a crisis atmosphere. To what extent is this true? We must bear in mind in considering this question that farming more than any other industry is vulnerable to the twin evils of disease and bad weather. Of course farmers can talk themselves into problems and there can be panic selling which can depress the market; these things happen. But it is a fact that there has been a downward trend in beef prices over the last 18 months. I would remind the right hon. and learned Gentleman that it was going on under his Government when he had joint responsibility for agriculture in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, the average price for clean cattle in January 1973 was £20.02 per live cwt. In April 1974 it was £18.47 per live cwt. But in some markets the prices have been much lower. I am informed that the price in Llangefni market last Thursday, 13th June, was £14.50 per live cwt, which was frighteningly low. We know from the figures we have read that the market again fell substantially yesterday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to look at this against the average cost of production, which is something over £20 per live cwt. I am also told that ordinary calves have been selling at a very low figure indeed in Llangefni and elsewhere. This fall in prices at this time is very disappointing as we had hoped that prices would have held and improved until beef begins to come off grass later on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore we know that the slaughterings of cows, bulls and calves are high, and we must therefore be concerned about the future of the national beef herd in the longer term. As my right hon. and hon. Friends know, I believe strongly in the selective expansion of certain agricultural products. I assert again that the policy we followed on beef in the late 'sixties resulted in the expansion of the beef herd in the early 'seventies. One cannot create a beef herd overnight. It is the product of a three-year cycle. The problem in the pig sector is acute chiefly because 80 per cent. of its production costs is accounted for by feeding stuffs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I too am glad to see my hon. Friend the Minister of State here with us this morning and I should welcome his com
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
ments on the present position of beef, milk and pig farmers. Is it accepted that they are currently losing money and is there a danger of a damaging decline in the stock numbers? This is important for the future of agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that my right hon. and hon. Friends would agree that this state of affairs should not be allowed to continue, because agricultural expansion is the declared policy of this Government as it was of the last. It is the right policy. We must expand, or we shall be compelled to import more and more, and we shall pay more and more for the imports, with all that that implies in terms of balance of payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will certainly cross swords with anyone who tries to say that this Government is the Government of the consumer as against the producers. The right hon. and learned Gentleman made the allegation and it is unworthy of him. He does not normally indulge in such remarks and it was quite wrong for him to say it this morning. It is the duty of Government and Opposition and all other parties to consider the dilemma now facing the industry, and not to cast recriminations across the floor of the Committee. Of one thing I am absolutely certain, and that is that my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, who is a good friend of the farming community, will negotiate for farmers to the best of his ability.'
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measures that the Government have taken to combat inflation are right and they should be given a try. Food subsidies, which have been criticised in some quarters, are an essential ingredient of that policy. It is a difficult policy to operate, but if it helps to combat inflation, if it helps to stabilise the economic situation, it will have been worthwhile, and it will help the farmer and the consumer as well as the rest of the nation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is one problem which we must solve if we are to avoid economic catastrophe, it is the problem of inflation. It is against that background that we have to consider food subsidies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that my right hon. and learned Friends will agree with me that it would be disastrous to allow the agricultural production of this country to contract at
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0407">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
this time. For a variety of reasons, I think that the era of cheap food as we know it is over for ever. We shall not be able to go round the world shopping for a cheap joint. It will be as hard to find as cheap oil. Welsh lamb and Celtic Sea oil may be the salvation of our problems!
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But what has frightened the farmer is that he has no floor to the market. That has created insecurity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friends brought home a creditable package from Brussels in March. The right hon. and learned Gentleman criticised it this morning, but he did not do so when the my right hon. Friend made a statement on the Floor of the House. [Hon. Members: "Oh, yes."] Certainly not. Nor did the official agricultural spokesman of the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend is now on his way back from Luxembourg. We are glad to learn that the terminal date on the pig subsidy of 50p per score has now been extended to 1st September, and this has already been welcomed by the National Farmers' Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As hon. Gentlemen have reminded us, these consultations are taking place against a background of a beef surplus of nearly 100,000 tons. It is no use hon. Gentlemen saying that is only two days' supply. It is more than two days' supply; but surely it is the growing accumulation of surplus and the overflowing centres of storage that are causing concern throughout Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friends statement in Luxembourg which has been referred to and which I have just read contains positive and constructive proposals to improve the working of the CAP. The right hon. learned Gentleman and his hon. Friends should study it more carefully. The proposals are now to be considered in detail and I hope that they will be adopted soon, although one or two of them may meet with some resistance, notably that on pricing policy. In his statement my right hon. Friend rightly said,
	<br><blockquote><p>"The common agricultural policy is under severe strain."</p></blockquote>
He also said.
	<br><blockquote><p>"No one would deny that the beef regime is under severe strain."</p></blockquote>
His proposal for a variable premium paid on slaughter is interesting. Perhaps
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
my hon. Friend the Minister of State will explain this proposal in greater detail and tell us how it will help the beef farmer in practical terms. What total sum of money, for example, does he think will be involved? I understand that it is proposed that the money would be financed by FEOGA. My right hon. Friend's second proposal of a calf production subsidy is also valuable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But my right hon. Friend understands full well that these are longer-term palliatives and they do not help in the immediate problem. It will therefore be helpful if my hon. Friend the Minister of State can tell us if any further national, as opposed to Community proposals are under consideration to provide the farmer with the security he needs over the next few months while these longer-term objectives are being reviewed in Brussels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one short point I wish to make and that relates to the O'Brien Report on the export of live cattle. Farmers are anxious to know the Government's response to it and I hope that the Minister of State will say a few words about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the farmer needs urgently is the assurance that machinery exists to avoid the collapse of the market. If the policies outlined by my right hon. Friend in Luxembourg will provide long-term security, he will have earned our gratitude. I know the farmers of my constituency pretty well. They are not the wealthy farmers of popular legend. They are amongst the hardest working members of the community. They are not tied to a 40-hour week; like Members of Parliament, they work all hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. and learned Friend quoted from Ceiriog. I shall quote, too, if I may:
	<br><blockquote><p>"MAEN CYSGU GYDAR HWYR</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>AC YN CODI GYDAR WAWR,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>A DILYN YR OG AR OCHR Y GLOG</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>A CHANLYN YR ARAD GOCH</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>AR BEN Y MYNYDD MAWR"</p></blockquote>
Roughly translated, this means that farmers work very long hours.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0408">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
after so wise and so skilful a speech as we have just heard in which, while apparently bringing support and succour to his right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Wales, he has pretty well demolished the entire Government case, in particular the contention of the Secretary of State that the troubles of the farming community arise from our entry into the Common Market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In so far as the Common Market has a part to play in the misfortunes of Welsh farmers, it is due to the fact that, as a result of a sequence of policies, the farmers are getting the worst of all worlds. The way in which the transitional period has worked, in combination with the arrangements which the Minister of Agriculture has secured in Brussels, has ensured that we get all the disadvantages and none of the advantages of membership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I propose to follow the same tone as the right hon. and learned Gentleman in not seeking to apportion blame for the disastrous situation in which the livestock producers in Wales find themselves at present, with market prices still falling in such a way as to give the farmers a feeling of real anxiety. While market prices continue to fall and show no sign of a slowing down in that fall, there is as yet no sign of a halt to the rise in the cost of concentrates, fertilisers, to the ever-mounting cost of rates and, above all, the ever-mounting cost of the water rate. Gravest of all is the continued rise in interest rates. Many farmers, basing their confidence on the expansion of the past few years, have embarked upon ambitious schemes which have involved borrowing large sums of money from the bank. They now find themselves unable to find a way of paying the interest on their overdraft.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not seek to apportion blame for this state of affairs. If any apportioning of blame was to be done, my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Hendon, South (Mr. Thomas) did it in a most magisterial and damning indictment, and I think that the case can rest there.

What is to be done? The farmers want to know what we are going to do. In this situation there is a special responsibility upon the Opposition not to cavil at or query any steps the Government may
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
take, both in order to bring first aid in the present crisis and, secondly, to restore confidence in the long-term future to the agricultural industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it so be that any measures the Government decide on are in conflict with what we on this side have hitherto maintained to be sensible, we must be prepared, temporarily, to swallow our principles. If it should transpire that a return to some kind of deficiency payment is the best way out of the impasse, it will be incumbent upon us not to taunt the Government with adopting such policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally. it is for the Government to recognise that, despite what the right hon. Gentleman has said—I hesitate to cross swords with him — the feeling is widespread inside the agricultural community that farmers are more concerned with the short-term interests of the consumer than with the long-term interests of the producer. It is up to the Government to correct this impression, not just by words, but by actions. It is to that that the agricultural community will be looking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The statement made in Brussels by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, has its merits. Unlike the Secretary of State for Wales, he has clearly been consulting his Cabinet colleagues and discovered that it is now, apparently, the policy of the Government to renegotiate with a view to success, with a view to remaining inside the Community, and to making the changes which all agree are necessary, and to making those changes from within. Perhaps this change of front will reach the Secretary of State for Wales in the near future. It certainly has not reached him this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two specific points, slightly outside our discussions hitherto, which, I think, are open to the Government with a view to restore some confidence in the agricultural industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first relates to tied cottages. Anybody who mixes in the agricultural world knows that all this airy-fairy talk that takes place on the other side of the Committee about the iniquities of the tied cottage system has no reality in the agricultural context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without some means of enabling the farmer to provide his key workers with accommodation, it is simply not possible for the dairy farmer to continue in be-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0409">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
ing. The Government must remove the anxieties which exist on this score. They must show that, if they intend to persist in this lunatic, policy, they will provide some kind of satisfactory arrangements to safeguard the legitimate interests of the farmers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point relates to the much-canvassed, much-heralded, wealth tax. It is generally agreed, even by those who accept the need for a wealth tax, that it is simply not possible to apply such a tax to farms or to non-building land in general. It simply cannot be done, because there is no means whereby they can realise a portion of their assessed wealth each year in order to pay the tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So it was, I think, with a sense of incredulous horror that some of us read the account in the 	<i>Economist</i> this week of the scheme being hatched up in the fertile brain of Lord Kaldor, whereby the farmer would, under the wealth tax arrangements, be required each year to surrender the title to a percentage of the valuation of his farm to the State, so that after a number of years, the State would be the owner of all agricultural land.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neil Kinnock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has engaged twice in scaremongering during the last two minutes—first, on the question of tied cottages. If he reads the Bill of my hon. Friend the Member for Keighley (Mr. Cryer), he will find that there are the safeguards that he wants for the farmers. Secondly, when he talks of the report in the 	<i>Economist</i> last week, may I assure him that it was only hatched up, but it was hatched up by the 	<i>Economist</i> and not by Lord Kaldor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir A. Meyer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very glad to have that reassurance. Provided it is repeated by the Minister of State, it will go a long way towards allaying the apprehension which undoubtedly persists.

	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir A. Meyer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As it is open to hon. Gentlemen opposite to deny it, we await the denial with impatience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.42 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwynoro Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must tell the hon. Member for Flint, West (Sir A. Meyer) that in Carmarthen in the last election I met scaremongering about nationalising agricultural land and what the Labour Party would do with farmland. It is totally untrue to state that Labour will nationalise farms. My right hon. Friend the Member for Anglesey (Mr. Hughes), obviously inspired by my words in Strasbourg, led the way in the Welsh Grand Committee this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I represent the most agricultural constituency in Wales with over 5,800 of my constituents working in agriculture and, on the Labour side of the House, probably the most agricultural constituency in Britain. I hope what I have to say will be listened to by my right hon. and learned Friends on the Front Bench. Some of the things I say they may not particularly like, but I hope that they will take them in good heart.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend mentioned scare-mongering among farmers. There might be an element of truth in what he said, but I should like to reassure him that the contacts I have with the farmers in my constituency clearly show that the industry is in a state which it has not been in for many years. The confidence of the industry is at a very low ebb and a considerable degree of apprehension exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to say to the two hon. Members who will wind up the debate that they should not be involved in the question who is to blame for the crisis. They should set about telling the farmers, my constituents and the Committee, how both sides of the House of Commons envisage the future for the farming industry. We do not want to hear anything about costs from Front Bench speakers. We have given them those figures. We want them to tell us how they will deal with the problem from now on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the industry there is a genuine fear and concern. Farmers responded in a big way to the call to expand two or three years ago. Interest rates were 7 per cent.,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0410">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
8 per cent. or 9 per cent. Farmers borrowed heavily to finance the call from the Government to expand. Now they are paying dearly for that policy of expansion in interest rates and in many other ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only have the costs of production increased alarmingly, but the end price to the farmer has declined, over the past 12 to 15 months. With record costs of production, and falling end prices, it is clear that confidence is bound to suffer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will absolve my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Wales from one blame, and the Opposition must do the same. He has inherited a major problem. He found the state of agriculture —the figures relating to cost of production, declining milk production, increased slaughtering and a fall in the use of artificial insemination service—all on his desk when he took over on 2nd or 3rd March. So it is an inherited problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, however, the fact remains that it is a Labour Government that find themselves in power and it is the responsibility of that Government to deal with the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not true to say that the two major parties have had the glorious opportunity for 20 years to look into the long problem facing agriculture in Britain? They have had a glorious opportunity, and both major parties have neglected the agricultural industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwynoro Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to cross swords with the hon. Member for Cardigan this morning, but I am surprised that a Member who comes from an agricultural constituency and who has been in the farming industry for most of his lifetime does not realise that successive Governments in this country from 1947 onwards have given to the agricultural industry greater security, which was not there in 1947, and vast financial support and encouragement. It is easy for the hon. Member to say that the two main parties have failed, but has he a solution? It is easy for minority parties to say anything as long as they do not have to implement the policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the major argument of cost escalation. The annual price review talked of an increase of nearly £800 mil
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
lion in costs of production in 1973–74. The Minister knows that that rate of increase has not declined since February. I have figures with me this morning to prove that since the annual price review costs in Wales have increased a further £2·8 million and that other costs of production since the last review, if totalled over the whole of Britain, would reach a figure of between £94 and £99 million. I emphasise that that is the extra cost since the last review which, during the election period, was an under-recoupment review, in that it failed to begin to meet the costs escalation of 1973–74.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The further point I want to stress to the Committee is that we want to get away from the too readily found belief that there is a dichotomy of interest between the farmer and the housewife. There clearly is no such conflict of interest. If we develop along those lines and if policies are pursued with the express intention of creating a conflict, then at the end of the day everyone will suffer. Over the last five months milk production has declined by about 5 per cent. in Wales. The use of animal feeding stuffs has declined since last autumn. There are dangerous signals on all fronts. The decline in the period January to March 1974 in the breeding herd for the first time since 1970 must bring home to us the problem. Therefore the danger signal is that in the long run the housewife will suffer as well. If there is a shortage of milk, a decline in the beef supply and breeding herd, then two or three years from now the housewife will have to bear the cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe in subsidising key parts of the household budget and I support that policy but I would remind every member of the Committee that it is no use talking of subsidising milk and other foodstuffs if at the end of the day there is a continuing decline in milk production.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Wales the increase in the cost of production has had severe consequences for the industry. Wales predominates in livestock and livestock products: 50 per cent. of Britain's total livestock value comes from Wales; 42 per cent. of her livestock products value comes from the Principality. Because of the structure of Welsh agriculture—35 per cent. of our agricultural output is milk; 26 per cent. is beef and veal—the picture is clearly a gloomy one and all the more acute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0411">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
I shall conclude by emphasising the importance of agriculture to rural Wales. It moulds our way of life and strengthens its culture. Thirty-six per cent. of my constituents who are employed, work in, or are connected with, agriculture. That is a considerable figure and the economy of my constituency receives some £10 million from agriculture. For this reason, I am happy to know that the Secretary of State for Wales is now actively considering the appointment of a body for mid-Wales agency to co-ordinate the functions of agriculture, industry, tourism and forestry. This is long overdue, and the last four years have been wasted ones for mid-Wales. For far too long we have viewed every facet of mid-Wales life, its agricultural and industrial problems, in isolation and the establishment of a government co-ordinating agency will mean that the problems will be tackled more effectively, since co-ordination of rural activities is crucial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agricultural industry's contribution to the Welsh way of life is enormous. Its contribution to total Welsh output is about 12 per cent. Its contribution to Britain's balance of payments problem could be a fundamental one and, whilst not transforming it, could go a considerable way towards reducing the balance of payments deficit, provided farmers are given the financial tools to expand. Farmers require not just confidence and words. They need financial assistance to survive the present crisis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also represent a mining community. The coalmining industry has been regarded, quite rightly, as a special case—not just the miners, but the industry. I submit that, if coal is a special case, agriculture should also be examined in the same context—as a special case needing special attention, because unless we are able to halt the decline in production and the loss of confidence, we will pay dearly in the coming years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall conclude with two brief points that I have already raised. I wrote recently to the Chancellor of the Exchequer regarding the problem of estate duty as it affects farmers. I would like to point out to my learned Friend the Minister of State for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Wales that the enormous increase in land prices in Wales over
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
the past two years is creating a major problem for the family farm. If we in Wales are going to keep the family farm, which has been the backbone of our agriculture and of our rural way of life, then, as I suggested to the Chancellor, the estate duty regulations must be amended. The son must be able to take over from his deceased father without having to meet the enormous burden of estate duty unless he realises the value of the farm by selling it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a case in my constituency of a 200-acre farm. The estate duty in 1970 would have been £6,000. It is now £35,000. The son is expected to carry that burden, although he is not selling the farm. Of course, if he decides to sell, estate duty should be paid, but not if he decides to retain the farm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I return to tenant farmers. Before the election I had a bill before Parliament designed to give greater security to the deceased relations of a tenant farmer, and greater protection against harassment. I know the Minister of State has a genuine concern in this matter because I know of his work on the Agriculture Act 1967 as it related to Scotland. I shall not outline the well known problem here, but I urge the Minister of State to pursue with vigour the aim that we in England and Wales should have the same facility as is available under the Act for Scottish tenant farmers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.56 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Edwards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I just want to say a few words on the general problems of rural Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no political pre-conceptions about the organisation that is best suited to dealing with these problems. My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Hendon, South (Mr. Thomas) when in office thought that a case could not be made for an organisation such as the Highlands and Islands Development Board. He was supported in that view by the reports produced by the Welsh Council, but the Welsh Council said that the subject would be looked at again when the new local authorities had had the opportunity to prove themselves, and I retain an open mind on that aspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. and learned Friend was able to point to some successes in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0412">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
mid-Wales—the success of the Mid-Wales New Town Development Corporation and the reversal in the decline in the farming population that had taken place over such a long period in that part of Wales. We shall await the Government's proposals, with an entirely open mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The burden of the Highlands and Islands Development Board has, been, greatly reduced by events in north-east Scotland, as I saw on a recent visit. It may be that the time is approaching for a switch of resources to the surviving problems in rural Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past, I have argued for greater flexibility in a number of respects. I have argued in Committee the need to have a more intelligent approach to the problems of designing factories in rural Wales. I could never see why the Government insisted on putting up enormous red brick constructions geared to take major industry when all we needed were small, white, well-heated buildings in which people could perform the small assembly work that is needed in so many small towns and villages in rural Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have studied with some interest a paper circulated to Members of Parliament—I am always prepared to study the views of other political parties—and called " The Rural Wales Authority ". It admits that some of its ideas may not be practical, but it contains a number of sensible suggestions. It may be that greater co-operation among farmers, which is something I have long urged in rural Wales, and the greater modernisation of the farming industry which the article advocates may have the consequence in some cases of reducing the population still further. It is one of the effects that we shall have to face.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I cannot accept—and I have argued this point in Committee before with Mr. Elystan Morgan—is the argument about the closure of village schools as advanced here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course I would accept it if it meant the removal of the children to the towns. But the paper suggests elsewhere that since it is impossible to realise the ideal of obtaining work for every town and village in rural Wales, the aim should be to make employment available within 10 miles of homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
It seems to me that the same argument can be advanced for the schools, certainly in Pembrokeshire. I have been enormously impressed by the success of the area school policy and the incredibly high standards now provided in schools such as Roch, which was opened last year in my constituency. I should be grateful if the right hon. and learned Gentleman would take note of the fact that we anxiously await news about the new area school at Wiston; it is a church school which I believe is now held up as a consequence of existing financial stringencies, but for which there is a strong demand in the surrounding villages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is only by the provision of such well-equipped modern schools that community services can be provided in many parts of rural Wales and I point again to the modernisation programme now being prepared at the Hayescastle school which will provide, for the first time, an adequate hall in the area. On this subject, I quote the Director of Education in the old Pembrokeshire County Council when, at the opening of the Roch school, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"People will want to live in the countryside if their children can attend schools like this."</p></blockquote>
At the same time, he expressed the view that the creation of such schools was essential if the Welsh language was to survive. He said that if there were an insistence on the retention of small schools, the language would die. I believer that that is a view, with his great experience, that we should respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After dealing with the depopulation in rural Wales, the Rural Wales Authority paper states that when discussing the restoration of rural Wales, one must begin by considering the future of agriculture. It is with that comment in mind that we must consider the present state of the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Farmers' Union of Wales publication says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Union is convinced that very many Welsh farmers do not have the capital necessary to survive their current difficulties, and that unless the Government is willing to act without delay, a large number of farmers will leave the industry, thus weakening further the already shaky foundations of the economy of rural Wales. This would imply a permanent contraction of the economic base of these areas, resulting in an increase in depopulation and unemployment."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0413">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
This debate is critical, therefore, for the Welsh economy. In the long term, it is critical for the consumer. It is immediately critical for the farming industry and, as we have heard, within the farming industry the gravest crisis is in the livestock sector, which is responsible for 85 per cent. of Welsh agricultural production.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is accepted that the Government inherited a difficult problem. I think that we might have heard a little more from the Secretary of State in the context of the undoubted success of the previous three years. After all, he freely acknowledges it in the Green Paper " Wales," issued this week, where on page 50 he talks of the continhed expansion of the agricultural industry in Wales in early 1973, points to the great increase in the average net income of Welsh farms in 1971–72 over the previous period, and describes the large capital investment that took place in Welsh farms during that period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We could point to a string of figures to show the increasing productive capacity of British agriculture during the period and the way the farmers responded to the call for expansion. But we accept that the Minister inherited difficult problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not intend to swamp the Committee with statistics; we have had a good many already. I do not think that the Government will challenge the conclusion of the Farmers' Union of Wales publication that its analysis of the position leads it to the conclusion
	<br><blockquote><p>"…in each sector of British livestock production… farmers are currently losing money on most of their enterprises. As a result, particularly the numbers of the breeding herd in each sector, are falling rapidly."</p></blockquote>
We accept that and there is no need to argue about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The secretary of my local branch of the NFU wrote to me last week and said that the situation was still absolutely depressing. Confidence in the industry is at its lowest ebb since I have been involved with the NFU over the past 10 years. He gave me the figures of the average store stock market prices at Haverfordwest Mart on 5th June 1973, when they were £156.59 and on the 4th June 1974, when they were £131.54. That has to be put in the context of the massive in-
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
crease in prices. Pig farmers are losing at least £3 per head, particularly in Wales where grain is not generally grown on the farms. Therefore, they are not in the same position as many farmers in the rest of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had some 10,000 sow slaughterings each week in the United Kingdom as a whole and 150,000 since March. We have had 4,400 beef animals slaughtered a week at an average loss of about £27 per animal, and all this despite the fact that we are spending £700 million a year on food subsidies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not take up the argument on food subsidies with the hon. Member for Carmarthen (Mr. Jones), except to say that a fraction of that expenditure would have transformed the situation for agriculture. We are entitled to ask what the Government are doing except talking. For instance the pig situation and the news from Brussels. Even with the subsidy, the pig producers are losing money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a circular sent to Members of Parliament recently, the NFU said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"At current levels of cost, especially feed, even the most efficient pig producers are unable to make any profit whatsoever. Since the inception of the special payment of 50p per score deadweight on 21st March, market prices have fallen by, on average, 30p per score."</p></blockquote>
and in many areas it has been more. It added:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Pig producers' total returns, including the special subsidy, are still about 50p to £1 per score on average below what is necessary to restore profitable production.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>It is no use tinkering around any longer with temporary solutions."</p></blockquote>
But that is precisely what the Government are doing. No radical Government proposals have emerged for tackling the crisis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it hard to speak critically of the Secretary of State for Wales because he is a thoroughly agreeable man. I am not unfair. I compare him with a favourite character of my youth, Ferdinand the Bull. He is a thoroughly charming and amiable creature to whom one would wish to entrust one's family. He is thoroughly estimable in every way. But let us face it: we would not put Ferdinand into the arena. Nor would we put the Secretary of State into the arena in defence of Welsh interests, or in defence of agriculture in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0414">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
The right hon. and learned Gentleman spoke of his well-known connection with farming. His family, who must initially have reacted with pride to his appointment, must by now be feeling a touch of embarrassment. As he goes into the mart or into the pub, his brother must have to face some awkward questions, perhaps we had better leave the pubs out of it. Perhaps the best he can say is "Am I my brother's keeper?" There is an odd irony in the fact that Abel was a keeper of sheep and Cain a tiller of the soil.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I spoke earlier of a lack of confidence in the industry. It is reinforced in Wales by a complete lack of confidence now throughout the Welsh countryside in the ability of the Secretary of State to do anything about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He has given no reason just words to show that he cares, no reason to think that he understands the gravity of the crisis and the growing certainty that even if he suddenly recognises the disastrous consequences of his Government's policy in rural Wales, he simply has not got the ability or the determination to do anything about the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Howells</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having had an interest in the production and marketing sides of the industry for many years, may I declare my interest? We have very little time left this morning, but I should like to discuss a long-term agricultural policy for Wales, and hope that in the near future we shall be given an extra day in the Welsh Grand Committee for further discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The farmers are worried about present trends. That is why my friends are here today, from all parts of Wales; they are worried about what is happening in their counties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Welsh agriculture is in dire trouble. The farmers are depressed; they have nearly lost confidence in the future for themselves and their families. Never have I known agriculture to be in such a depressed state. Wherever I go in Ceredigion farmers plead with me, especially the younger ones, to bring pressure to bear on the Government to recognise that agriculture is facing its worst financial crisis since the war. Why is this so?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
I had a word with an estate agent last week in Cardiganshire. Apparently, this time last year there were eight farms for sale; this year he has 80 farms on his books. Evidently something is radically wrong with our industry. We have heard from right hon. and hon. Members that we should do this, that and the other, but one thing is certain: the workers of this country are entitled to a guaranteed minimum wage. The farmers, on the other hand, are entitled to a guaranteed price for what they produce. That guarantee is what is missing from our industry today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The previous Government did away with the guaranteed price system for beef. The present Government did away with intervention support. At the moment we have not got a guaranteed system of any kind for beef producers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last Monday in mid-Wales the right hon. Member for Anglesey (Mr. Hughes) said that he had got £14 in Llangefni for best beef, but store-fed cattle in mid-Wales were sold at £13.10 on Monday. That is 50 per cent. less than this time last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind right hon. and hon. Members on both sides of the Committee that farmers in Wales are receiving 50 per cent. less than their counterparts in Europe for beef. I strongly oppose the intervention system of buying. There is something radically wrong with it. There is a vast difference between intervention support and the system of buying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am comparing this system of intervention buying with Biblical times, when meat was hoarded and livestock killed in the autumn because people could not afford to keep livestock during the winter. The main reason today for this depression in our industry is that on the Continent beef is being hoarded into cold supply. I disagree with this system. We want a guaranteed price system for beef. The previous Government made a great mistake in doing away with that system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am convinced that the majority of farmers in Wales are behind me when I say that they want a guaranteed price system to be maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that this time we have learned the lesson that we need such a system and that the Secretary of State for Wales and the Minister of State for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food will press on the

	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
Minister of Agriculture the need to improve the common agricultural policy in the near future so that it will help the Welsh farmers in the long term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have evidence about pig producers, which I shall be willing to hand over. A Cardiganshire farmer kept 248 pigs from 1st January to 30th April 1974. The net loss over a period of four months was £813. He is not the only pig producer in this country. They are all in trouble. All the beef producers are in trouble and I hope that something can be done, not in six months' time, but in the next few weeks before the calf sales in the autumn. I believe that the calves this autumn, unless something is done now, will be selling at between £30 and £40 apiece. I hope that I am wrong, but something has to be done to bring stability back to this sector of the industry of which we are so proud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel sorry that I have to say that I think that the Government are pursuing a very expensive food policy by taking no heed of the farmers who are saying that we are heading for a crisis. We are in a crisis and something must be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Strong efforts do not seem to have yet been made by the Government to ensure that Welsh farmers obtain a reasonable standard of living. I hope that we shall soon have another day to discuss agriculture, and I hope that this afternoon we shall have an encouraging statement from the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food that will bring stability back to the industry to which we are so proud to belong, the major industry in Wales and the most efficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I read in the this morning's paper that £600 million is to be given to the coal industry to increase its production by 30 per cent. in the next few years. Let us give the Welsh farmers £100 million to see what they can do to improve and increase production from the hills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a final note about Welsh hill land use; there are two schools of thought about what we should do with this land. Many believe that it should be turned into a playground for Midland people and that it should be for recreational use only. I believe that, given the right incentives for the long term, we can double or treble our output from the Welsh hills. If we had the incentives and the money, I am sure that it can be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
I hope that the Secretary of State will propose a comprehensive scheme for mid-Wales, that he has learned a lesson and will not offer us something similar to the rural development board that the previous Labour administration offered in the 'sixties and which we shall again oppose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I was not so convinced by the attitude of the Secretary of State that he was convinced of the depth of the crisis that we are now facing and I hope that the Minister of State in his reply will be able to show us that he is very concerned about the way things are developing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the Minister of State is here and I hope that we shall see, as a developing feature of the Welsh Grand Committee, the presence of Ministers from other Departments when there are joint responsibilities and that they will take an active part in our debates. The Minister will be able to show the developing thought of the Government on this issue, particularly what they are proposing in terms of immediate action in the short term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been emphasised that the gravity of this crisis is indicated by the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0416">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
depressing levels of the receipts of farmers at various markets. I will not repeat the figures we have heard. The crisis is also reflected in the accounts of individual farmers in medium-scale hill and lowland farms throughout Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is particularly painful for me, as a former active member of the Young Farmers' Club, to see the losses incurred by the young livestock producers who have learned the skills of effective stock mangement, but are totally unable to get any return from their activities. As we have heard, the crisis is also reflected in the number of breeding cattle being slaughtered and the effect that that is having on our breeding herd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also reflected in the number of farmers leaving the industry and going off the land. I hope that the Secretary of State is an avid reader of the 	<i>Farmers Weekly</i> and will have seen in last Friday's edition the strong words of Mr. Robert Davies about the number of farms now being sold and the fact that very few entrants are coming forward to buy the listed farms. Most buyers are reported to be businessmen looking for a second home, or hippy communes. In many cases the land is going out of agricultural production. This clearly is a further mark of the massive crisis we are now facing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figure we had last year was of a decline of 12 per cent. in the numbers actively engaged in agriculture in Wales. I am afraid that we have to issue a clear warning in the Committee today that if the present trends continue, that figure may well be doubled during the next year. The crisis is also reflected in the massive escalation in feeding costs and fuel costs and in all the other input costs of the agriculture industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not be drawn in what is to be a brief contribution to comment on the hypocrisy of the other Opposition party this morning. By allowing our agriculture industry to decline in this way, successive Governments are writing off 80 per cent. of the land area of Wales. They are creating what may well become an under-productive and under-populated green desert. In this area 50 per cent. of productive employment is in agricultural production, apart from those people engaged in ancillary industries in the services sector in the market towns.
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
Those of us living in small market towns in rural Wales are all totally dependent on an active and thriving agricultural sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The value of agricultural production in my constituency of Merioneth is over £5 million a year. I think that I have added to the notes of warning that have been expressed about the nature of this crisis, and I welcome the statement by the Minister of Agriculture in Luxembourg yesterday. I look forward, if I catch Mr. Speaker's eye, to commenting on it this afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be grateful if the Minister would give us some detailed answers about how the proposed alternative means of cash support which the Government are proposing will work. How will the FEOGA premiums operate? Will it be at live weight sale, or at slaughter? In which ways will this be parallel to the former fatstock guarantee system for beef, and in which ways will it differ? How will the production subsidies operate and what will their effect be, if they are introduced, on the existing range of hill cow subsidies? Will they be only for rearing calves, or will they be related to the total cost of producing store cattle? Has the Minister considered introducing in addition to the points in his general statement a price supplements scheme on feeding stuffs to meet the massive escalation in feeding costs?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a little concerned about the implications in the Minister's suggestion about lowering the intervention price for milk products in stages if the EEC stock rises above pre-determined levels. Have the Government considered in detail these implications for milk producers in rural Wales?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am even more concerned to see that there was no reference in the Minister's statement yesterday to the EEC directive of 19th and 20th November 1973 on hill and less-favoured areas. I sincerely hope that this directive will be part of renegotiation—I notice that the Secretary of State said " negotiation " this morning, not " renegotiation ". I hope that in the negotiation process the hill and less-favoured areas directive will be renegotiated—I stress the " re ". Under the present qualifying factors of the EEC scheme as laid down by the Commission, we in Gwynnedd are to be exempted. We shall
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0417">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
not be a hill farming area because we fall 1 per cent. below the EEC qualifying level. I have outlined my broad reactions to the Minister's statement and I should like to have some detailed responses, either during this sitting of the Committee or later this afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I would stress that this grave crisis cannot wait until 1975 for an overall review of Community support for beef. Beef producers need support now to prevent a total collapse in the livestock market before the autumn sales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would press on the Minister of State to restore the fatstock certification scheme to the way in which it operated prior to the great sell-out to CAP by the previous Government. This must be done immediately if we are to retain our livestock industry intact. I will follow the traditions of this Committee and quote Ceiriog:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Ni fydd hen fugeiliaid na bugeiliaid newydd ar yr hen fynyddoedd hyn."</p></blockquote>
I shall refer briefly to the Secretary of State's comments about Mid-Wales and about comprehensive development there. I was glad to see that he is now committed to a programme of comprehensive development. I should like to remind him of a famous speech by his predecessor in Llandyssul in 1970 in which he committed the Labour Government, had they been returned in 1970, to a Highlands and Islands Development Board-type structure for Wales. I hope that that has not been shelved by the present administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Secretary of State's announcement about the advance factory at Bala. I am also aware that he has been studying the operation of the Mid-Wales Development Corporation at Newtown. But I must ask him how long this review will take. How much evidence does he need before finally deciding that Newtown is a success and that the Corporation's powers can be extended to Bala and other growth areas in Mid-Wales? This is urgent. The right hon. and learned Gentleman has, within the powers of the New Towns Act and the way it operates in Newtown, an integrated development of housing and industry, the very thing that he talked about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate his concern about the lack of Treasury finance for the development of Mid-Wales, but for one-thou

Friend the Member for Carmarthen (Mr. Jones) over his claim that he represents the most agricultural constituency in Wales. What he means by "the most agricultural" I do not know, but I can tell him that we have a few more sheep than he has and perhaps a few more cows.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of who has caused the present situation and the crisis that we face is relatively unimportant. What is important is what we are to do about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister seemed to be constructive in his speech in Luxembourg yesterday. But that is a long-term programme. What concerns us today is what will happen in the next few months, and I want to impress upon my hon. Friends that we are in a crisis situation and we require immediate help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not trying to bandy statistics—they are already well known and they are pouring in from all quarters. I believe that the intervention system of the EEC is totally immoral, and I use the word advisedly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not play with that system in any shape or form. As in the past, we should use deficiency payments. That would satisfy me on two counts. I have heard it said that there can be no cheap food any more. However, we can make food as cheap as possible. We must make this basic commodity as cheap as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0418">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
Equally, I have never believed that it should be done at the expense of people who depend upon and work in agriculture. The deficiency payments system can help the industry and the consumer. Intervention can only stack up higher prices. I ask hon. Members who support the intervention system whether they do not believe in cheap food or making food as cheap as possible. It is all very well supporting one side of the argument, but why let the other side suffer in the process?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this situation, we are going through a difficult period. It is said by some that if we weather this storm, there are better times ahead. The small farmers, who are in a preponderance in our area, cannot weather the storm. They find life extremely difficult now. The have no reserve on which to fall back. I feel strongly that something should be done fairly soon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have recently met farmers who decided in the late autumn not to sell their calves. They have recently returned from market with those same animals. Because there were no buyers, or because there was an unsatisfactory price, those animals, which they had considered selling in the autumn, are still on their hands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quote one example. In October, £20 a cwt was being offered in a sale in my constituency for calves. In November, the price was under £15 a cwt. A friend of mine turned down this price. The animals that he brought back in November he had to bring back again in April because he was offered only £7 a head more for them, and they were two cwt heavier than they were in November. That is the situation that we are facing with calves and beef.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What farmers are looking for is a realistic floor to the market. It is as simple as that. Providing a guarantee is put in on the beef side, they will be satisfied. It does not have to be an astronomical price, for they are realistic about it. I implore the Minister to impress upon his right hon. Friend the need for such a price.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been getting by in our area because land prices happen to have been reasonably good. In effect, lamb has been subsidising beef for farmers lucky enough
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
to be in this joint venture. However, I must sound a note of warning. The price of lamb was coming down last week. There is a danger but we must protect against it. I know we have a floor in the lamb market, but we must beware, for more farmers will be in trouble when they have not got the lambs to fall back on. We are building up trouble for the future, in that there is so much slaughtering going on that there will he a shortage and it is the consumer who will suffer eventually. If we go into a period of shortage in a year or so, the consumer will have to pay higher prices. I beg the Minister to look at the situation, not only from the consumer's point of view, but also from the farmer's point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other things that can be done to help. I ask the Minister to consider restoring the lime subsidy. He will know how necessary lime is in our heavy rainfall areas. He will know that there is a shortage of basic slag. This is due to the changed method of production in steel. What is important is, not what has caused the shortage, but that there is a shortage in an area which provided some element of the lime needed. Now we do need help with lime for the long-term, because in a belt-tightening operation this is one of the commodities that suffers first. This is where the farmer must draw in his reins.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same is true of fertilisers. Will the Minister bring back the fertiliser subsidies so that we can prepare for the long-term? These two commodities are vitally important for the long-term health of the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point that has been put to me is that the fencing grants that are available on common lands in the uplands might be extended to lowland commons. This could help considerably in these areas. I warn my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State that we are going to approach him for some assistance with fencing of common lands relating to improvements that are to be made on the A470 in my country. We hope that he will view our supplication sympathetically and will assist the graziers in that area to ensure, not only safety, but that they can have a more profitable existence than they have enjoyed previously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0419">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
There is no need for me to dwell on the difficulties relating to credit, for instance, that the farmers are facing. Having embarked upon quite ambitious schemes, as my hon. Friend the Member for Carmarthen mentioned, using credit, they now find life difficult in trying to repay such credit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn briefly to the other aspect of our debate—that of rural affairs. Last year's Water Act gave powers to the Welsh National Water Authority and took powers away from us in this place. I beg the Secretary of State to press upon, and impress upon, the authority that its present system will not work. It is not acceptable to people in our areas. The authority must speed up the process towards changing the system. It is all very well for the authority to sit back in its office when we are the people who have to face the public and explain to the public what is going on. One cannot answer the questions on this issue when emotion takes over about the nonsense that presently exists in the charges in Wales. We must have a rapid revision of the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be grateful, too, if the Secretary of State would pass on to Ministers in the Department of the Environment the news—it should not be news to them —that the rating system is generally breaking down. The present haphazard system will no longer be tolerated. We need a complete revision of the rating system, not only the support from central Government, but revision of the way in which rates are collected and the basis on which they are collected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we can have my right hon. and learned Friend's re-affirmation of his determination to deal with the problems of rural and mid-Wales. I hope he is pursuing very urgently the White Paper on his plans for mid-Wales. Other people have mentioned the growth town policy. He will know that we have been settling this for years past with his predecessor in the former Government. We have had the need for a kiss of life in this policy for a very long time and I hope that he will give us this kiss of life so that we can have some action in this matter. I hope that he will review this matter with the utmost urgency and produce a document that we can debate in this Committee fairly soon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.40 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geraint Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope and believe that no member of this Committee would accuse me of having been excessively partisan in the past in any of the speeches I have made here. Today I hope to avoid making mere party political points because it seems to me that the situation of our oldest and greatest industry is far too serious for that sort of discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with what was said in that respect by the right hon. Member for Anglesey (Mr. Hughes). I am bound to say, however, that I should be failing in my duty, not only to the farmers whom I represent, but to the farmers of Wales generally, if I were not to emphasise certain serious faults and omissions in the Government agricultural policy and make suggestions for its speedy improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State made an able speech this morning. He gave vent to many fine thoughts. He expressed sympathy for the industry which I have no doubt he genuinely feels, but I regret to say there was little indication of action at the end of it all. What we were promised more than anything else was pie in the sky on its way from Luxembourg. We have some fore-knowledge of what that amounts to, and I hope to deal with that later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that Ministers will accept that I am making constructive suggestions and will regard what I say in that light.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I should like to re-echo what has been said from both sides of the Committee, namely, that the terrible problem now facing the industry did not begin on 28th February this year. One must ask what is the general background.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are all aware of the great expansion of agriculture since 1945. The fact that we now, with a much reduced labour force, produce more than two-thirds of the food consumed in this country as compared with rather less than one-third before the war is a measure of that achievement. I would be the last to deny credit to the Labour Party for the contributions which they made and the legislation which they passed between 1945 and 1951.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought it a little unfortunate that the hon. Member for Cardigan (Mr. Howells)
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0420">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
saw fit to criticise both parties. I do not want to go into history, but I am not aware of any great contribution that the Liberals made to support agriculture in their days of power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The unhappy position is, quite bluntly, that all this great achievement could be swept away in the course of two years or less if the present situation is not dealt with. If we are again reduced to a state of depression such as we suffered between the two wars, then we cannot fall back on cheap food markets abroad. We no longer have Empire countries—as they then were. We no longer have the Argentine and countries like that, to which we could turn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is hardly necessary in the short time at my disposal for me to repeat some of the things that have been said in the course of the debate about the problems of agriculture. Up to about a year ago there had been sustained expansion of the industry but, as with other aspects of our national economy, a grave situation developed almost overnight with the explosion in world prices. It became particularly serious at the beginning of this year. It is hardly necessary for me to remind members of the Committee of the meteoric rise in the price of animal feedingstuffs in the last 12 months. On average, it has been appreciably over 100 per cent. and that has been accompanied over the same period by increases ranging from 25 per cent. to 100 per cent. in the cost of machinery, equipment, fuel and fertilisers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To sum it all up, the net result is that, with rearing costs doubled, calves selling at half last year's price, with prime beef cattle losing between £20 and £30 a head, and producers thinking themselves lucky if they can break even. the situation is very serious indeed. In the livestock sector the only meat currently being sold at a profit off our farms is lamb.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. and learned Gentleman spoke rather complacently of the prosneritv of sheep farmers It is true that they have not suffered like other sectors of the industry. But, not unnaturally, the lack of confidence that has beset the rest of the livestock sector has impinged neon the sheen sector as well. Can the sheep farmers be blamed if they fear that what has happened in other sectors will
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
overtake them within the next year or so?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How has this unfortunate turn of events affected Wales in particular? The answer can be given in a few words. It has probably been affected more than other parts of the United Kingdom. The arable sector in Wales is, for geographical reasons, very small and not capable of expansion to any material degree. The farmers, by and large, have not been able to recoup their losses to any substantial degree as a result of the better cereal prices last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, Wales leans heavily on the livestock sector, which, as my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Hendon, South (Mr. Thomas) pointed out, accounts for no less than 85 per cent. of the gross Welsh annual agricultural output of £140 million. Of that, about 50 per cent. is produced by dairy farming, 15 per cent. by beef production, 15 per cent. by sheep, and 10 per cent. by pigs. There was a time in the past when we had a sizeable poultry flock as well, but that has virtually vanished because the situation is so bad. When I tell the Committee that nearly 99 per cent. of the farms in what used to be Denbighshire have no poultry stock at all I need say no more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I deal with the problems in the various sectors of the livestock industry, perhaps I may make a general observation with which I think no member of this Committee will disagree. Most of our farms are small: they are family concerns with little capital backing, and they are thus the least able to face up to the increasing cost of feedingstuffs and fertilisers, dumping, and high interest rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I concede that the agricultural crisis did not start with the General Election. I would not claim that the policy of the last administration was entirely free from criticism, as regards milk production. We all make mistakes and, if we are wise, we profit from them. Some action should have been taken in respect of the dairy sector during the autumn of last year. There was no lack of urging that something should be done on the part of hon. and right hon. Members on both sides of the Committee, including myself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The then Minister of Agriculture was honest enough to say afterwards that he
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0421">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
should have taken action at that time. He admitted his mistake and went a long way to restore confidence in the dairy sector by his action in the Annual Price Review which, in effect, amounted to subsidising the Milk Fund by some £145 million, thus enabling a 3½p per gallon increase to be made in the price of milk to the producer, with a retrospective increase of 1½p per gallon over a period of about six months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That provision was not received with wild excitement by the dairy sector, but it was generally regarded as being as fair a contribution as the Government could be expected to make in our present stringent financial circumstances. Certainly it went a good way to enable dairy farmers to recoup the extra cost they had had to bear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By contrast, the consumer subsidy provided by the present Government, whereby the price of milk has been reduced by 1 p per pint, has done nothing whatsoever to help milk producers. No one among the public expected this reduction and one cannot help feeling that the money required for this particular consumer subsidy would have been far better applied, in the ultimate interest of milk consumers themselves, either in the form of a further increase in the return to the milk producer of, say, 1 p per gallon now or later in the year, or, better still in the present circumstances of the industry, to the support of other ailing sections of agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is in this Committee today with those other sectors that we are primarily concerned, and I shall deal first with beef producers, who have suffered most. I have already referred to the catastrophic increase in costs and to the fall in prices. A remedy must be applied at once in the way of some form of guaranteed price. Although I rarely have the privilege of appearing on the Front Bench. I can say categorically that this is something which a Conservative Government would provide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where we, as a party, entirely part company with the Government is in the belief, which they apparently hold, that this fundamentally disastrous situation is something that can he effectively tackled by way of such measures as the calf subsidy which, indeed, is the only one adopted to assist the beef sector. It
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
seems to me that this is merely a palliative, does not get to the root of the disease, and does nothing to engender longterm confidence. After all, effective assistance must be a long-term matter. It must be remembered that the beef we are eating today started life in 1971 and 1972.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Farmers' Union has said —I entirely agree—that a solution must be found either within the machinery of the European Economic Community or, temporarily at any rate, by return to the old guaranteed price system which could, with regard to beef, be reactivated without much difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I strongly agree with what has been said in this context by my hon. Friend the Member for Flint, West (Sir A. Meyer) and assented to by my hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke (Mr. Edwards).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The terrible gap in the Government's policy, as has been effectively pointed out by my right hon and learned Friend, is that for the first time since 1947 we have no floor to beef prices. On the one hand, there is no guaranteed price. On the other hand, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has thrown intervention out of the window as a means of support. He said, in terms, that he has no intention of using the intervention barrier, and I do not think that I am being unfair to him when I say that, when he returned from his disastrous Brussels visit, towards the end of last March, he came back with much less than he set off with. It is not surprising, therefore, that one influential Welsh newspaper was moved to describe him as "having retired into a political monastery ".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The 	<i>Western Mail</i>.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case for one form of support or the other is unanswerable. As long ago as October 1972—long before the explosion in feed and fertiliser prices—a Government inquiry came to the conclusion that it was not economical to produce beef unless an animal could be sold at £20 Per live hundredweight. After the price explosion it can fairly be said that—I am being most conservative in saying this
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0422">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
—farmers need a minimum of £22 per live hundredweight to cover costs—that is, without giving any return on capital invested whatsoever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The harsh reality is, as has been pointed out in the Committee today, that in local markets in North Wales, such as St. Asaph and Llangefni, the average obtained for the best animals is no more than about £17.50 per live hundredweight. The right hon. Member for Anglesey mentioned that the price had gone down to £14.50 and I also, like the hon. Member for Cardigan, have heard of figures as low as £13 per live hundredweight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that context there seems to be a slight glimmer of light coming from Luxembourg. I understand that the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is pressing for a variable slaughter premium which, as I understand it, is a form of guaranteed price. Of course that is yet to be achieved and we have yet to know at what level it will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One way in which I can fairly sum up the beef situation is this: a price that must inevitably lead to agricultural bankruptcy cannot be right. Therefore, a remedy must be found.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I, too, would ask the Minister of State who is closing the debate to tell us about the Government's attitude towards the O'Brien Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn briefly to the problems facing pig producers. This part of the industry in Wales is small, but no one could say, with any justice, that there is any lack of organised marketing. It is almost wholly geared to weaner production, and many Denbighshire farmers have been pioneers of weaner groups. Weaner prices in Wales are linked to fattener prices across the border, which are at present very low, and it is no exaggeration to say that the plight of pig farmers in Wales is probably even worse than that of their counterparts elsewhere in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. and learned Friend mentioned that in the United Kingdom as a whole 10,000 sows and gilts are being slaughtered weekly. To give a local Welsh example, in two cases near Denbigh the sow herd has recently been reduced from 90 to between 25 and 30. Indeed, what else can one expect a
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
farmer to do when he is losing £4 or more per pig? The devastating truth is that the pig herd, after considerable expansion, particularly after 1970, is now back to the level of 1964; and if things continue in this way one can visualise the pig herd rapidly disappearing over the precipice like the Gadarene swine of old, driven this time, not by the devil, but by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Secretary of State for Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that a palliative has been applied here as well in the form of a short-term subsidy or premium of 50p per live score. Of course we must be grateful for small mercies. We welcome the introduction of that, and we welcome what we understand is going to come from Luxembourg. It is nothing very exciting: it is going to be a diminishing return and it will be extinguished altogether on 3rd November. It is no longterm solution. It is totally inadequate, and it is evident from the ever-increasing slaughtering figures of pigs that the premium has done nothing to halt to decline of the pig herd. I am sorry therefore to have to pour cold water on these little crumbs that have been offered to the industry by the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like all open-ended subsidies, this subsidy suffers from the defect that, with knowledge of its existence, a lower price is offered in the market. I am reliably informed, for example, that immediately after it was introduced the market price for pigs fell by 20p per score, and that they are now down by 30p, and so the net gain to the producer from this governmental exercise is no more than 20p per score. Clearly, an arrangement of this sort cannot begin to be as satisfactory as a guaranteed price, however that may be contrived. It was for that reason that a Conservative Government over 20 years ago abandoned open-ended subsidies in favour of deficiency payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Right hon. and hon. Members opposite are entitled to say, "You make criticisms, but what do you suggest is the answer?" I would respectfully suggest that a much more satisfactory system of support would be one based on the old feed formula. I appreciate that it may be said from the other side that this was abandoned—yes, I can see the grin on the Minister's face—in January 1973 as part
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0423">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>53</span>
of a package deal with the EEC. However, in fairness to my right hon. Friend the Member for Grantham (Mr. Godber), I must point out that he took that action long before the unexpected price explosion took place, at a time when the pig industry was in a healthy state. In view of the turn of events, consideration should be given to a reintroduction of the feed formula. It should not be beyond the ingenuity of Ministers to obtain EEC approval to such a course, if only as a relatively temporary measure, the more especially as I understand that the Minister is pressing for something very similar in principle as far as beef is concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to deal with one last matter briefly. This debate is concerned not only with agriculture but with rural problems generally. I will not say anything about the Rural Development Board, but I have been asked to raise a matter on behalf of the Farmers' Union of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Considerable ill-feeling has been caused by the fact that Wales has been left out of a study of rural roads carried out by the Local Government Operational Research Unit. This survey had the job of considering how much money should be spent on improving country roads and whether there was a need for transport depots to be set up for some of the freight that is now being transported on country roads by heavy lorries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This omission is all the stranger because, when the Conservative Government of 1955 put through the Agriculture (Improvement of Roads) Act, it was specifically intended that Welsh roads should principally benefit from it—as in fact they did—and I have always regretted that that useful little statute was allowed to lapse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should be our purpose today, irrespective of party, to do what we can to save our oldest industry from disaster, and the Opposition will gladly support any realistic measures that the Government see fit to take to that end. I am sure that they feel, no less than the Opposition, that so far as Wales is concerned there is at stake not merely the future of an industry but that of a culture, a language and a way of life.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>1.1 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State for Agriculture,
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
Fisheries and Food (Mr. Norman Buchan)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to thank you, Mr. Davies, and all the members of the Committee who have made me so welcome here. There were some unexpected sources of that welcome and I was no less pleased to receive it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am replacing another Welshman. My learned Friend the Member for Lewisham, East (Mr. Moyle) was expected to take this debate but, although nothing has yet been said, rumours are bruited that he may be moving to look after yet another part of the British Isles. So a Welshman representing an English constituency dealing with another part of the nation is being replaced by a Scotsman representing an English and Welsh Ministry. I like the unity and diversity of these isles of ours—several nations in one country—and long may they continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must therefore thank everyone for the welcome accorded to me and merely make one apology, that I am probably the only Member here who is not only unable to do so but certainly will not be quoting from the Ceiriog today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also want to say how similar this Committee has been in some ways to the Scottish Grand Committee. I sometimes felt at home were it not for the frequent quotations from Ceiriog.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all started by saying that we were not intending to indulge in recriminations; but that was the first point of similarity. The second point was that the lone Liberal who is present to decide the actions overwhelmingly supported by his own party expected us to act upon them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to deal first, not with the most serious aspect of the debate—there are serious aspects—but with a less serious aspect, although one that nevertheless must be dealt with. That was the point raised by the hon. Member for Flint, West (Sir A. Meyer), and by other hon. Members, in relation to land. It was dealt with by my hon. Friend the Member for Carmarthen (Mr. Jones) who had the same comment made, to the point of it becoming a smear; and, as we all know, smears tend to be counter-productive, as my learned Friend showed by his overwhelming majority. The hon. Member for Flint, West should perhaps take that to heart.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>
On behalf of my right hon. Friend and the Government I say that we reject the totally unfounded fears that have been expressed about agricultural land—that is, agricultural land at present used for farming—being taken into public ownership. I want to utterly reject that. Our proposal—I thought everyone knew this; and, if everyone knows this, it is more serious that the mis-statement should be made—relates entirely to development land and land which is needed for building, to ensure that the community gets the benefit of that development and not the individual who is fortunate enough to possess the planning permission. We reject the canard completely, if I may use a French word in a Welsh Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kinnock</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend leaves the subject of land, there is one aspect of it which is of particular interest to Wales. One of the worst afflictions of rural Wales is the abuse of the Agricultural Holdings Act 1948 by some large and often absentee landlords who employ agents to harass tenants by imposing heart-breakingly unreasonable default orders. Do her Majesty's Government intend to take any steps to remove what has been called this rural Rachmanism?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of the problem. I met a number of farmers before the election and raised the matter very sharply with them. One of the earliest minutes that I wrote in the first days I was in office asked for back papers on this problem. I have seen them. There is strong feeling among a number of farmers that this is happening. I cannot say that I have received really conclusive evidence that landlords are acting unreasonably. No doubt the tenants believe that they are being harassed in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make a point about the legislation, which they may find helpful. The legislation provides that, unless a notice to remedy is served, the tenant must be given a reasonable time for compliance, and the tenant can contest his liability to do the work by requiring arbitration. Moreover, successive notices to the same tenants within 12 months should be disregarded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are valuable safeguards. They should be applied and used by tenants. However, both I and my right hon. Friend
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
are watching the situation very carefully. This is a similar reply to the one I gave to the hon. Member for Cardigan (Mr. Howells).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the question of recriminations. It is always nice to start off by saying, We do not intend to indulge in recriminations, but ", and then proceed to at first, that it was rather like Satan pan the Government in power. I thought, rebuking sin, except that we do not accept the sin. What can we say, then? More than one farmer has said to my right hon. Friend and I that they know of no occasion in recent agricultural history in which agricultural Ministers have inherited such difficulties as we inherited on 28th February.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me recall a little of the background, and set in perspective, both for this Committee and others, the situation as we saw it. We saw a situation in which there had been two reasonably good years for most farmers, in terms of either cereals or livestock. None the less, they were reasonably good years at a price. I take up what my hon. Friend the Member for Carmarthen said, that we must not talk in terms of adopting a consumer policy or a farming policy. We must adopt a policy that is in the interests of the nation, and that means protection and encouragement for the farmer, and it also means protection for the housewife.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We could not have continued on that path. In any case, events pre-empted a continuation on that path because of the rapid escalation of prices. That escalation began in the autumn of last year, and it culminated in the situation we inherited—a sharp escalation in feedstuff prices which particularly affected the dairy industry and the other sections of the livestock industry in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sympathise with, I understand, and am prepared to listen to the very grave problem facing the livestock industry. We recognise that problem. It is not one of our making, but it is one that we have to cope with. I will not accept this kind of criticism from hon. Members opposite. They allowed the situation to continue throughout the late autumn and winter months. They gave a very good return in the annual price review, but they had to. The costs were recorded costs. We used to worry if we had a £40 million, £50 million, £60 million cost bill to meet. My
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0425">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
right hon. Friend could cope with this but not a figure of about £700 million. If the Opposition criticise the situation at present, they are not only confessing that they brought in the measures to deal with the milk industry too late, but they are also by implication accepting that their decisions were too little.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we were faced with the position in which our agricultural objectives and our methods of promoting them were inhibited because of our entry to the Common Market. I am not now discussing the basic issue of the rightness or wrongness of that decision. I am saying that the common agricultural policy was not in itself a satisfactory policy, as many people in Europe are now recognising. It was, above all, a policy which was not suitable for a country with as efficient a farming policy as we have, and with a very large trading and industrial content in our economy. For those reasons, we said in advance that we would re-negotiate and we set out the terms of renegotiation. I use the term "re-negotiate ", if any hon. Member is worried about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe this had one unfortunate aspect and that is that the timing of the price rise in Europe coincided with the curious accident that the Conservative Party brought upon themselves when they fought the election. The Conservatives lost the election, and it is sometimes well for them to remember that. As a result of their losing the election, we had to deal with the policy which we had advocated, a policy that made sense to the farming community, to endeavour to get the kind of support that the farming community needed and, above all, the livestock industry needed, while at the same time making sure that we were not going to be crippled in those objectives by existing aspects of the Common Market. That coincided with the price rise in Europe, and from this stemmed a greater lack of confidence than the situation warranted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I am accepting the seriousness of the situation but pointing out that on top of that there were other factors which added to the decline in confidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have just been handed a note, Mr. Davies, and I regret very much that I did not know in advance that I must sit down at a quarter past one. I am feeling in
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
very good form and thought to keep going much longer than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Very quickly I want to say one or two things. Some things I cannot say because they will be covered in the statement of my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food this afternoon. It is a question of working through the details of his speech, and I can only refer to his speech and not to any Press comments on what might have been agreed in Luxembourg. I believe that we will find this afternoon that there are aspects which will answer some of the problems and worries that we have been expressing. It is a start in the right direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By entering the Common Market under the existing terms and now deciding to re-negotiate from within we have to get these kinds of agreement in Europe before we can take certain actions to deal with our own situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On pigs, we will be able to give a great deal of support. I do not write it off as a little fleabite as did the hon. and learned Member for Denbigh (Mr. Morgan). The subsidy of 50p per score going on to the late autumn is a considerable support for the industry and a very necessary support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To have new aspects of the treatment of beef discussed in Europe is in itself a major step forward. I think that hon. Members this afternoon will find that many of their questions have been answered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I have extra time, Mr. Davies? I have been taken by surprise by the time factor, of which I was unaware, I have taken on board many of the points which have been made. I understand and sympathise completely with the difficulties expressed by farmers throughout the land. I stress that the Government are firmly committed to an expansionist programme on agriculture. My right hon. Friend the Member for Anglesey (Mr. Hughes) started off that expansionist programme, and the improved conditions in our herds over the past three years arose directly from his policy. We intend to continue with that; as it makes economic sense that we should have an expanded industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say further that, irrespective of my attitudes, for I am known as an expansionist in agriculture, any future Government in Britain must be devoted to the expansion of British agriculture. There-
