HOUSING IN WALES</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p><i>Question proposed</i>—(<i>this day</i>)—
<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee have considered the matter of Housing in Wales.—[<i>Mr. John Morris.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>4.3 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ioan Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very pleased to have this opportunity of making my maiden speech in this Parliament in the Welsh Grand Committee, although of course I have often listened to previous meetings of the Grand Committee when I was the Member of Parliament for Birmingham, Yardley. I am fully aware of the envious eyes that are cast at this assembly by representatives in England, because, not only do we have the opportunity of speaking on the Floor of the House on matters relating to Britain, but we also have this additional opportunity of dealing specifically with issues relating to Wales. This is, as it were, a second home.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Edwards) agreed with his parliamentary colleague the hon. Member for Flint, West (Sir A. Meyer). They both said that they were not proud of the record of the last Government. I am sure that they will be pleased to learn that I am not proud of it either. While it can be said that the record of the last three and a half years is deplorable, I do not go along with those hon. Members when they say that this applies to all parties, because, in considering the housing progress which has been made since 1945, the record of the 1945–51 Labour Government, that of the 1964–70 Labour Government and the way that the present Government have started show that the Labour Government compare very favourably with the Tory Party.<br><br>
The Secretary of State has given us a challenging speech. We have heard before of the need to tackle the prob-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 56</span>
lem in housing that faces us in Wales, but today we heard a promise of action, I thought. If the programme outlined in the Secretary of State's speech is to be carried out, it will go a long way towards solving the problems that face us in Wales.<br><br>
Opposition Members say that they want to keep ideology out of housing. But that cannot be done. One's ideology determines one's attitude in forming housing policy. Either we believe that houses should be built for profit, or for homes, to meet the housing needs of the people. That is where we come to the parting of the ways in our attitude to housing, compared with the Opposition.<br><br>
I believe that the Government have started well in this programme. The policies outlined in the Gracious Speech, supported by the majority of Members of Parliament, should go a long way towards solving the problem. Within days of the new Government being formed on 8th March, orders were issued freezing all residential rents at their present level for the rest of 1974. The move applied to council rents and private housing whether furnished or unfurnished. Over 270,000 council house tenants in Wales will benefit from the consequences of the Government's step.<br><br>
Mortgage rates have been held at 11 per cent. The houses we are building today in Britain are too expensive. Young couples are finding it increasingly difficult to set up homes. The Tory Party has spoken about the need for a property-owning democracy. But what we have created in the housing sector is a moneylenders' paradise. Since 1970 prices for both new and existing houses have risen on average by 100 per cent. They doubled in price during the previous administration's period of office. Many young people who have committed themselves to buying houses will think themselves lucky if their grandchildren own the houses they occupy now.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Conway (Mr. Roberts) suggested that the choice lay between buying or renting a house. That choice does not exist for the vast majority today. Houses for rent are not being built, and people cannot afford to buy one. It has been said that 90 per cent. of the houses being built are too expensive for 90 per cent. of the population.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0371">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 57</span>
Therefore, to suggest that building houses for owner occupation will solve the problem is not the case. The Government are to be congratulated on their recent action in preventing a further increase in mortgage rates to 13 per cent. It is reported in the Press and through the media today that funds are flowing into the building societies, which fully justifies the Government's prompt action, as that may prevent mortgage rates from rising further.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Conway said that owner-occupation was very dear to the hearts of the people of Wales. Under a Conservative Government it has certainly proved very dear to their pockets. In addition to the Government's step forward, we are promised further action in the future. Tenants of furnished accommodation are to be given security of tenure. That is a big step forward. The disastrous Housing Finance Act has done much to cause difficulties to municipal tenants. Local authorities had to appeal to the Government to be given dispensation not to increase rents. But the previous Government impelled them to increase rents. Now we have a Government who are acting wisely to prevent those increases from being brought about.<br><br>
Land needed for development is to be brought into public ownership. At long last in Wales we shall be able to sing, "Hen Wlad fy Nhadau" and mean it. All the proposals, I believe, will contribute towards solving some of the housing problems. Many of the houses in Wales are, however, too old and ill-equipped. That is why we should welcome the extension of the home improvement grant scheme that was to have ended on 23rd June.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Bedwellty (Mr. Kinnock) suggested that a register of builders should be compiled, so that the work could be carried out, and that the list should be maintained. Numerous complaints can be made about the way in which this work is being carried on at the present time. In Wales there are too many one-man building businesses—jobbing builders—and many of them would submit a tender to rebuild the Pyramids if they were given the chance. They are taking on more than they can cope with, and that is why I welcome this extension.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 58</span>
But I hope that there can be greater control to ensure that they carry out the work, and carry it out more efficiently, because there is a great deal of heartbreak in the way that the schemes are being carried out in many areas at the present time. I am sure that many hon. Members could relate stories of constituents who have accepted one tender, after which the individual who gave it has not been seen again until months later and the whole home improvement has been delayed.<br><br>
Although much can be achieved by improving old homes, we need the new housing drive that the Secretary of State has spoken about. We need to expand the local authority housing programme. It was interesting to hear the Member for Flint, West say that he does not need more houses in West Flint. Let me quickly say that if his allocation can be given to us in the Cynon Valley we shall be very pleased to receive it.<br><br>
I welcome the statement made by the Secretary of State that in 1974–75 an extra £14 million will be made available to local authorities in Wales to increase the housing effort and that £9 million of that amount will be earmarked for additional houses. We in the Labour Party are not anti-owner-occupier. We can take pride in the fact that we introduced the Leasehold Reform Act, and no Act benefitted owner occupiers and the people of Wales more than that one. If the growing needs for better housing are to be met, we must give the people the choice to own or rent houses. We must find methods to encourage the people who wish to own their own house, but we must also make provision for those who wish to rent their house.<br><br>
I should like local authorities in Wales to build houses for owner occupation for local authority tenants, thus releasing local authority houses which could be offered to those on the waiting list. We would then be fulfilling the need of those municipal tenants—local authority tenants—who want to become owner-occupiers, and the people waiting for a home would be provided for.<br><br>
I should like also to see more encouragement given to housing associations and to co-operative housing schemes. Reference was made this morning to what has happened in Scandinavia, but the housing problem there has been solved to a great
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0372">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 59</span>
extent by the formation of co-operative housing schemes. This is a form of collective ownership where people have the advantages of owner-occupation without the disadvantages of being tenants. I think this is something which we should consider in the years ahead.<br><br>
I should like to see an expansion in the number of homes for the elderly, the lonely and those unable to look after themselves, by encouraging those elderly citizens who would be willing to enter the homes and look forward to the opportunity. I believe it would release existing accommodation for younger families.<br><br>
I should like local authorities to get together to form building consortia to build houses for both public and private development. The Labour Party is committed to the extension of social ownership. I think this is one method by which it can be expanded, and I believe that local authorities should be brought in to a greater extent.<br><br>
In considering the question of housing, I hope we shall have increasing regard to obtaining a better environment. The Cynon Valley, which I represent, is a beautiful Valley from Hirwaun down to Ynysybwl and Abercynon. But despite the unavoidable difficulties created by industrial and mining development, the local authorities have endeavoured to improve the environment in that area. But we must ask ourselves: Is the destruction of a better environment always unavoidable? In the middle of the valley we have a great Phurnacite plant which is pouring smoke into the atmosphere. The people of the valley are prepared to put up with this pollution because it means jobs, but cannot something more be done to minimise the pollution in this lovely valley?<br><br>
The Coal Board now proposes to commence work on on opencast mine near Abernant, another lovely part of the valley, to provide the coal for the Phurnacite plant. I hope that the Welsh Office can help us in the Cynon Valley to obtain extra jobs in the area without our having to be threatened time and time again that it must be at the expense of the environment.<br><br>
The Secretary of State has rightly said that as far as the Government are concerned our priorities are to be twofold,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 60</span>
namely, housing and jobs. I agree with him, but I would add a third: let us have decent housing, let us have a good choice of jobs in Wales but let us also have an improved and continually improving environment where we can enjoy working and living.</span></p>
<p>4.17 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ceraint Morgan <span class='memberconstituency'>(Denbigh)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My first and very pleasant duty is to extend my congratulations to the two hon. Members who have made their maiden speeches in the Committee today, the hon. Member for Cardigan (Mr. Howells) and the hon. Member for Aberdare (Mr. Evans). Of course I well remember the hon. Member for Aberdare in his previous incarnation.<br><br>
I am afraid that my next comment on the meeing today cannot be quite as favourable. It is this; that it is a great pity that so much time has been taken up in this important debate with the bandying about of figures relating to houses built or improved, whether they have been built in the private sector or the public one, and so on, even going back to 1945. If there was any flaw in the able speech of the hon. Member for Aberdare it was his seeking to go back into history in that way.<br><br>
I regard this as being at best a sterile exercise. I do not think that it is in the best traditions of this Committee and it is one in which I do not propose to indulge. I associate myself with what was said by my hon. Friends the Members for Flint, West (Sir A. Meyer) and Pembroke (Mr. Edwards) when they observed that no Government of recent years, either the last one or its Socialist predecessor, had anything to be particularly proud of in their housing records.<br><br>
The short point as I see it is that there has been a decline in the number of new houses built for some seven years, and that covers the substantial span of three and a half years under each administration. There is a continuing and crying need for new houses, despite the fact that a number of houses have been improved. As my hon. Friend the Member for Conway (Mr. Roberts) pointed out—four times the number were improved last year as in 1969.<br><br>
This shortage of houses adds point to a plea which I made to the Secretary of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0373">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 61</span>
State in a quite different connection—concerning the route of the North Wales expressway. The route preferred by the Secretary of State, as we heard it recently announced, does not differ substantially from that preferred by his predecessor, my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Hendon, South (Mr. Thomas) and would involve the devastation of large areas of several towns along the North Wales coast, notably in Colwyn Bay, and this, of course, includes some of the best existing housing in North Wales.<br><br>
Let me tell him again that public feeling on this subject is very strong, that there will inevitably be a public inquiry and that when he has to make the final public decision—and I assume for this purpose that it will be he who may have the job of making it, although I am not sure of that, of course—I hope that he will take into account the threatened wholesale destruction of houses as an important factor in the argument against the route which he presently prefers.<br><br>
I want now to turn to another subject and to deal with it very shortly. It is the problem of the second home. I start with three premises in dealing with this matter.<br><br>
I think that all of us in the Committee are concerned with the preservation of the Welsh language and culture. I think that we are all agreed that it was a proper step to end improvement grants for second homes and, indeed, any other Exchequer contributions in support of them. I think, furthermore, that many of us will consider that this is a trend which in some areas of Wales we should not wish to encourage.<br><br>
Of course, these grants are now a matter of history. What I want to be assured of is that there is not going to be a witch hunt against existing owners of second homes. The creation of second homes in Wales has not been by any means an unmitigated blight. There have been economic benefits. It has been calculated, for example, that the existence of second homes in Wales has injected some £4 million per annum into the economy and has created some 1,500 jobs.<br><br>
This is not essentially a Welsh <i>versus</i> English situation, but a rural <i>versus</i> an
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 62</span>
urban one, accentuated in Wales by the Weigh national issue. What has been happening in Wales has also been happening in Devon and Cornwall and in most other attractive rural or coastal areas of the United Kingdom.<br><br>
Perhaps I am in a particularly favourable position to comment on this subject, because the Denbighshire County Council—or, rather, the county council of What was Denbighshire—made a study of this problem. Denbighshire, if I may refer to the old geographical entity still, is an area in which one can appropriately make a study of this kind, because it has its strong Welsh-speaking element and a strong English-speaking element as well.<br><br>
This study came to the following conclusions about the social effects of second homes. It is an interesting feature of its investigation that more than one half of the owners in the area surveyed claimed to have one or more close ties with Wales. I suppose the case mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke this morning is one in point. Twenty-six per cent. of those owners claimed to have someone in their families who spoke or was studying Welsh.<br><br>
I appreciate that there is local feeling on the matter and, for this purpose and in order to plumb its depths, this study interviewed a number of different people, six school teachers, six shopkeepers, three ministers of religion, three clerks of parish councils, a county councillor, a district councillor and, for good measure, a publican.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Jahn Morris)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A good measure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Good measure, indeed.<br><br>
Although it is perfectly true that about half of the people interviewed did not welcome the second home trend, preferring fin see the homes in their areas occupied by local people, they tempered that view by the comment that there was all too often, unhappily, no work for the young people, and the alternative to occupation of second homes was dereliction.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke so rightly pointed out this morning, it is often a false analysis of the problem that the depopulation of an area—he was referring to, I think, the Olchon Valley on the borders of the old
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0374">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 63</span>
Herefordshire and Monmouthshire—of its indigenous population is necessarily due to the acquisition of second homes.<br><br>
I revert to the study made by the then Denbighshire County Council. Half the people who were questioned also commented that young people in general preferred town life or council houses, that by reason of their isolation, their condition, and their poor facilities, the houses taken over as second homes were, in general, not the type to attract local people. It is broadly true, I think, that young people working in rural areas generally require either council houses or prefer, if they can afford it, to take out mortgages on a modern house more recently built. Only a very few of the people interviewed were prepared to attribute any housing shortage to second home ownership, though, of course, it is conceded on all hands that there has been an increase in property values as the result of their coming.<br><br>
Last but not least, the substantial majority thought that there was no antagonism between second home owners and local residents. I think that those remarks should be made in order that this emotional subject should be put in its proper perspective.<br><br>
There is one other matter I want to deal with and I certainly do not wish to exceed my time limit. It is this. When considering housing, it is appropriate that one should also consider the services upon which householders depend and to which they are entitled. My hon. Friend the Member for Conway this morning referred to the grotesque increase that had taken place in the water rates in Wales. This was a matter very properly and, if I may say so, effectively brought to the notice of the House itself by the right hon. Member for Anglesey (Mr. Hughes) in an Adjournment debate last Monday, and on this subject I should like to expand a little.<br><br>
I do not need to remind the Committee that this is a matter that has engendered great feeling in Wales, and as a symbol of it I have here a petition—I am not going to unroll it, for it is 17 feet long and signed by no less than 800 people from Denbigh—complaining about these water rates.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman will not sink
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 64</span>
too deep into the water question, but if it is directly relevant, it will be in order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope to keep above the surface in this context, Mr. Davies. I just wanted to make a few general remarks about it.<br><br>
If I may deal with the petition first; I shall be happy to leave that to the right hon. and learned Gentleman the Secretary of State or, if he pleases, to pass it on to the chairman of the authority. I have advised my constituents to deluge—I think that is the most appropriate word—the chairman of the authority with protests about these increases, for which I personally can see no sort of justification.<br><br>
If I may make just one comparison; in Wales as a whole the increases for measured and unmeasured supplies of water are 124 per cent. and 148 per cent. That is immensely greater than in Merseyside where the increase is appreciably under 50 per cent. Although Merseyside does not pay for Welsh water, as some people think Merseyside should, it has certain expenses to pay in the maintenance of supply pipes, so one would expect a greater increase there than in Wales.<br><br>
I can see no sort of justification for these increases, because it is not as if the charges in Wales had remained static for years and been gradually rising elsewhere. There were pretty swingeing increases in many parts of the old Denbighshire in the previous year.<br><br>
True to my principle of never encouraging party bickering in this Committee, I want to make two matters quite plain here and now. Whatever their shortcomings may be, one cannot blame the Government for these particular increases. I also accept—and I give credit to the Government for this—that they have tried to reduce the incidence of these charges indirectly by increasing the domestic element in the Welsh rate support grant.<br><br>
But while giving full credit to the Government for that, I say that they should not allow the matter to rest, because, all other considerations apart, it is no encouragement to householders to co-operate in counter-inflationary policies if they have increases of this kind imposed upon them. On the other hand, if the matter were allowed to rest, it would give
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0375">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 65</span>
every encouragement to other public enterprises, such as gas and electricity boards, to push prices up, having seen the Welsh National Water Development Authority get away with this monstrous imposition.<br><br>
A searching inquiry is needed into the authority's financial machinery and expertise, or lack of it. The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil will remember that I asked for such an assurance the other night in the Adjournment debate. I do not blame him because he did not give the answer then, for it was very kind of him to allow me to intervene at all in the circumstances. But I should like an answer on that point, and I am sure that many hundreds of thousands of people in Wales would, too.<br><br>
However, I understood from the hon. Gentleman during the Adjournment debate that the chairman of the authority would undertake a, and I quote his words,
<br><blockquote><p>"close and critical scrutiny … of the estmlates ".—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 6th May 1974; Vol. 873, c. 175.]</p></blockquote>
that are presumably the bases of these phenomenal charges. In my view he cannot do so too soon.</span></p>
<p>4.28 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alec Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It has always been a pleasure to me to follow the hon. and learned Member for Denbigh (Mr. Morgan), because, as Tories go, he is probably the best. He suggested that we should not look back and unduly worry ourselves about figures for 1946, and then proceeded to tell us that the Conservative Government had carried out more improvements last year than the Labour Government had done in 1969. But I forgive him his one political lapse on this occasion.<br><br>
I want to make a profound statement: no matter how many Housing Acts we have, no matter how many housing White Papers, no matter how many speeches we make in the House—even if we make brilliant speeches in the Welsh Grand Committee—those speeches and papers do not build houses.<br><br>
We have had a Housing Act almost every year that I have been in the House. I appreciate the point made by the Secretary of State, and I welcome the idea of a crash programme. However, despite
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 66</span>
the crash programme and general improvement areas or housing action areas, we delude ourselves and deceive our people unless we admit not only that we have a present housing problem —or a series of slightly different ones, depending on the area where we live—but that we are likely to have a housing problem for a good many years.<br><br>
I repeat the figure that I used in the debate on Monday, using my constituency as example. Although we are now improving older houses faster than ever before—it is unlikely that we can increase that rate within a short time because of lack of workers and so on—it will take about 50 years to bring our older houses up to date. Even if we were to double the rate of improvement, it would still be 25 years before houses in Rhondda could be considered to have the necessary amenities and improvements.<br><br>
Because I believe that there is a longterm problem, I welcome the Secretary of State's suggestion that we should look to the long-term objectives. I should have preferred him to use the expression "longer term ", because "long term" seems to stretch to eternity, and I shall not be here that long.<br><br>
I do not believe that the failure to house people adequately is caused by the lack of good intention on the part of housing authorities, or anybody else for that matter. I believe that there are shortages of certain essential resources. First and foremost is the shortage of money. Secondly, there is a shortage of land and materials with which to build houses. Thirdly, there is undoubtedly a shortage of skilled building workers. Somehow we have to concentrate on finding those essential resources.<br><br>
What makes housing a major political issue is the difference between the political views of parties. Housing policies cannot be divorced from the remainder of Government policies, which are based on political decisions. For instance, the taxation system itself decides what resources are to be made available for housing. If we are to tackle the land problem, land nationalisation is an issue. If we are to tackle the shortage of materials and public enterprises, there are means of doing so.<br><br>
I have considerable personal and political sympathy for my hon. Friend the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0376">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 67</span>
Member for Merthyr Tydfil (Mr. Rowlands). I understand when he has to reply in housing debates that there are bound to be difficulties. There are difficulties because on almost every issue the present Government are in a financial straitjacket. We should be foolish to pretend that that is not so. It is my view that the straitjacket was constructed and designed by the failure of the previous Government's economic policy.<br><br>
However, this straitjacket nevertheless exists. It means that we cannot do the things we want to do. That is why I think that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment was honest when he reminded us of that on Monday during the debate on the extension of the 75 per cent. improvement grant. He did not go as far as I wanted him to, but he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I would have dearly liked to go further. The reason I could not is, quite simply, money."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 6th May 1974; Vol. 837, c. 47.]</p></blockquote>
Therefore, such honesty is welcome even if it dashes some of our dearest desires.<br><br>
With that financial straitjacket, and all the difficulties surrounding Government policies right across the board, I particularly welcome the Government's decision to put in the extra £350 million and the £14 million announced this morning by the Secretary of State because resources are imported.<br><br>
I also welcome the Secretary of State's statement that we can look forward to a revision of the cost yardstick. It is possibly true that in some parts of the country the cost yardstick may not have been such a restricting influence as it has been in others. It is important that it be continuously revised so that it can never be a brake on council house building to rent.<br><br>
Our longer-term objectives for housing cannot be realised until the nation's financial resources are restored to a much healthier position. In the meantime, we ought to have a continuous close look at all our expenditure so that we do not waste any of our resources, nor use them on less important enterprises. For instance, if it comes to the choice between Maplin or homes, I know without doubt that it is homes for people, not Maplin development. I could add a few others for good measure. [AN HON. MEMBER: "The Channel Tunnel."] We now have the Channel Tunnel, too, if we want it.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 68</span>
I ask my hon. Friend the Member for Methyr Tydfil, who is partly responsible in the Welsh Office, under the Secretary of State, for housing, whether we cannot make a close examination of expenditure inside housing. I have one small example—not a massive sum of money but the well-maintained payment. We know that this idea was a sensible concept in the beginning, but I have an example in my own constituency of a row of houses at the top of Caroline Street, Treherbert, which have been so neglected over the years by their owner, the National Coal Board, that the council put a compulsory purchase order on them because the houses were unfit The whole street is now boarded up and waiting to be demolished. Despite that compulsory purchase order, of those 52 unfit houses in this street, neglected by the NCB, 41 have qualified the Coal Board for payments.<br><br>
The Coal Board is receiving well-maintained payments. It amounts to £2,500 but it seems crazy to pay £2,500 in well-maintained payments to the National Coal Board because it has failed to maintain the houses. If the houses were well-mainatined they would not be knocked down. That is the sort of wasteful expenditure on which we ought to be keeping a watchful eye in these days of shortages.<br><br>
When we talk of land, the cost is a feature even in Rhondda. One used to say that there one could have any local land cheaply, but the prices are soaring. Land prices in the last three and a half years make it absolutely essential that we move on with the Government's plan to nationalise all development landֵ. I have no objection to using the word " nationalisation ". If some want to call it public enterprise, they may if they wish. But it is essential that we move quickly so that land can be made available for the houses which we all need. Again it will take time, and in the meanwhile I ask my right hon. Friend to relate our housing problems and the need for land with his approval for the clearance of derelict land.<br><br>
On Monday I had an Answer telling me that in the proposed five-year programme submitted by Welsh local authorities there are 479 schemes at an estimated cost of £50 million. I wonder whether we may have some idea of how many of those schemes include land needed for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0377">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 69</span>
housing, and whether we are ensuring that they have a high degree of priority. The clearance of derelict land is one of the only sources of land in many of our valley communities. There just is not any other land available. Whether the requirement is for industry or housing, we must move rapidly in that field.<br><br>
If that marvellous day ever dawns when we have all the financal resources that we need and available land, we still would have to ask how we could sustain the house building programme at the size we need without ensuring the supply of building materials and skilled building workers.<br><br>
Most hon. Members will be aware—from constituency cases and perhaps from personal experience—of the existing shortages of building materials. The architect to the Rhondda Borough Council has told me of shortages of steel reinforcing rods, plaster, plasterboard, copper piping, ceramics and so on. It is true that the three-day week contributed to that shortage. But there have been shortages without the three-day week. Looking at longterm plans, if we are likely to be short of materials as years go by, is this not an area in which the Government can act for the establishment of public enterprises? We are short of building materials, and in development areas of Wales we are short of work. This seems to be an ideal source of employment for our people and at the same time provides us with desperately needed materials for our house-building programme.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bedwellty (Mr. Kinnock) suggested this morning that we might have an authorised panel of builders drawn up by local authorities. In an ideal society I would accept that, but in practical terms beggars cannot be choosers, and there are not sufficient building workers or builders available to do the work—to build new houses, to carry out improvements and minor repairs.<br><br>
Another hon. Member suggested that councils should do work by default. There are not enough people available to do this. From my own experience and from talking to others—I know my hon. Friend the Member for Newport (Mr. Hughes) has similar problems with building workers—this shortage is bound to inhibit
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 70</span>
the progress of our housing programme even when we stretch it out over many years.<br><br>
It was not only the loss of the 75 per cent. grant that caused us tremendous worry. The shortage of building workers, the applicants' difficulties in finding builders and having to accept almost anybody—this will almost inevitably mean a lowering in the quality and standard of work. I am sure that few members of the Committee have not heard of applicants who have been shamefully let down by the minority of builders, who have gone bankrupt and there they are—no work done and their money gone. So we must do something about increasing our work force.<br><br>
How many plasterers and carpenters do we really need? Have we in Wales taken a survey of this? Are we taking steps to ensure that our educational system fits in with our housing needs? I have in mind colleges of further education, Government training centres and even local authority apprenticeship schemes. Can we not urge these people to ensure that they provide us with trained skilled workers? They alone can build the houses—not politicians.<br><br>
I should like to say a word to the hon. Member for Conway (Mr. Roberts), since he referred to me <i>en passant</i> this morning, and then passed right by and forgot to call in. But we will forget that. He seemed to suggest some inconsistency between my proud reference to 80 per cent. ownership in Rhondda and my advocacy of an increase in council house building. I do not see any inconsistency in that. We have always been proud of owner-occupation in the Rhondda, and have used all available machinery to increase it, but owner-occupation has been made much more difficult in the last three years of Conservative rule than during any other period. We have now reached the position of house prices going up, mortgage rates and land prices going up, and the only thing that is going down is the number of council houses. The effect has been that the choice of whether to rent or to buy was taken away from the people of Rhondda. Economic forces compel these young married couples to say, "We can no longer afford to buy." This is what it has meant. In that period of three years the council waiting list in Rhondda
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0378">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 71</span>
has increased from 200 to 1,600. So I do not see any inconsistency. I am sure that if people had a real choice of buying a house at a reasonable price, they would accept that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wyn Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point that I was trying to make—in view of the hon. Gentleman's speech on Monday—was that the council waiting list is no indication of preference for ownership or renting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that is a semantic argument, because of the 1,600 on the council waiting list I should imagine that well over 500 have called at my surgery, and they have made the point clearly to me that they cannot afford to consider the idea of owning a house. One can argue that the 1,600 might be 1,400 or a bit more, because the waiting list may be overestimating or underestimating the situation. I suspect that in some cases people see that their chances of council housing are so remote that they do not even bother to apply.<br><br>
I make this point on this aspect. For these people—young married couples, particularly—who are in desperate need of housing, it is a Hobson's choice. Either they have a house to rent, or they will not have a home of any sort.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also suggested that perhaps we have not paid the right tribute to the 75 per cent. improvement grant. I do not think that that is true. Certainly on every occasion in the last Parliament when we discussed housing, either here or on the Floor of the House, I said that the introduction of the 75 per cent. improvement grant by the Conservative Government was a measure which I supported wholeheartedly. I welcomed it because I knew of the relief that it was bringing to my own people. Indeed, before the Government decided to extend the date to one year, I moved on the Floor of the House that they should do so. I welcomed that extension, and I welcome the present Government's extension.<br><br>
On this question of extension, however, whenever there is a deadline whether it is June 1973, June 1974 or the present Government's deadline—it is bound to discriminate between one group of people and another. It is the discrimination to which I object. I go along with the hon. Member for Flint, West (Sir A. Meyer) who suggested this morning
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 72</span>
that he could see no reason for a deadline at all, and that it might be reasonable to carry on the 75 per cent. grant right across the board. This is a view which hon. Members know I have held and expressed for a long time.<br><br>
I asked the Secretary of State about the improvement grant figures. I am doing this, frankly and honestly, not because I want to show which Government has done better than the other, but because I believe that we may be being completely misled by some of the figures that we are using.<br><br>
I have got the figures for Rhondda for each of the three years from 1971 to 1974. These show that the final approvals were 2,200. Yet during that period the jobs completed were only 1,000. There is a tremendous difference in those figures. The 2,200 figure would mean that the figures were boosted well up; but the 1,000 figure—the number of jobs completed—constitutes the real improvement in the quality of our housing stock.<br><br>
I am sorry that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has had to leave the Committee, but I understand the reason.<br><br>
We have 1,200 final approvals on which work has not yet started. There is a further complication in these cases. The work has not started because of the shortage of materials and builders. This means that there is an inevitable passage of time between the date of final approval and the date of the completion of the work. During that time lapse the cost of labour and building materials has soared, yet the amount of grant is never increased. In the Housing Bill, soon to be discussed, I submit that we should consider legislating to give power to devise grants at least so that account may be taken of genuine increases in labour and building material costs. Otherwise, if there is a lengthy delay between approval and job completion, it means that many people will not receive 50 per cent. grant of the real cost of their improvement.<br><br>
We talk about general improvement areas and housing action areas as if they are magic words that can solve our housing problems overnight. Let any Government make a suggestion and someone in Rhondda will want to try it out. The general improvement area suggestion was tried out and we called it Operation "Comfort". We chose an area that was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0379">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 73</span>
certainly not one of the worst. I wanted to go for one of the worst areas, but a reasonable area was chosen, with a cross-section of houses. We found in that area that out of 213 dwelling houses, 83 needed substantial improvement. We are talking about a relatively small area with a small number of houses and a smaller number needing improvement. Yet the time element is such that work was started in May 1972, and we are hoping to complete it by June 1974. In that limited area the work has taken nearly two years to come to fruition. Yet we were dealing with 83 sub-standard houses. If we compare that with the figure of 15,000 houses in Rhondda needing improvement, it indicates that even the general improvement area scheme is a long way from a perfect landing.<br><br>
By all means let us have our debates here, our Acts of Parliament and all possible schemes for improvement. But unless we can overcome those basic shortages of essential resources of money, land, materials and building workers, then my successor—and I shall be here for a while—will still be getting up here and talking about Rhondda's housing problem.<br><br>
Therefore, while I welcome the idea of a crash programme, I consider that we should be casting our eyes further along the highway if we are to solve the housing problems of Wales.</span></p>
<p>4.54 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. D. E. Thomas</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a privilege to be taking part in my first Welsh Grand Committee debate on the subject of housing, and particularly to follow the hon. Member for Rhondda (Mr. Jones), the heir and successor of Mabon.<br><br>
We have debated housing improvement at length but there are specific matters I want to raise regarding the implementation of the Housing Bill. I hope that the Under-Secretary will refer to them in his reply.<br><br>
Despite what my hon. Friend said on Monday on Second Reading, I am not wholly convinced that the housing action area strategy is appropriate for implementation in the type of rural area that I represent. My hon. Friend said that the declaration of housing action areas should have a finer mesh when rural areas came under consideration,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 74</span>
particularly in North Wales. However, for such a scheme to be effective in some of our towns and villages it would have to have as low a threshold area as 10. If that is not acceptable, the alternative is for a wider rural area to be designated as a housing action area. I am, in effect, proposing an alternative type of rural housing action area. Perhaps my hon. Friend would care to investigate that possibility.<br><br>
Another difficulty about house improvement in rural areas is that the cost of improving rural dwellings is usually greater than in urban areas. That is due partly to the lack of builders—a general problem for us all—lack of choice of builders. competition among them, the high cost of transporting materials, and the extra cost of drainage and the provision of water supply. The person in the rural area often gets less work done for his grant value.<br><br>
There is a further point on which I should like clarification. Could the Under Secretary confirm that the installation of septic tanks and piped water supply will qualify for an intermediate grant? As a matter of general principle, it is vital that improvement grants in towns or villages of rural Wales should go to improve the homes of people who live and work in the area. The cruel, social paradox in Merioneth on the last census night must not be repeated. Fifteen per cent. of our housing stock, that is, 2,500 houses, were standing empty on census night with all " mod cons ", whereas 40 per cent. of the houses in the area of Ffestiniog urban council lacked one of the three basic amenities.<br><br>
As for the extended deadline for improvement grants; while I am not slow to praise the decision to extend the dead line, I should like to ask the Secretary of State to look again at the position of those people who submitted their application in reasonable time to ensure completion by 23rd June 1974, and certainly in good time for approval by 30th September 1973, but where the local housing authority, for whatever reason—and in the case of one of my constituents the local authority blamed the August holiday period for the delay—delayed taking a decision within a reasonable time. Would the Under-Secretary give an undertaking that some of these cases will be considered on an individual basis
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0380">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 75</span>
and will he say whether there is any room for some flexibility?<br><br>
I warmly welcome the Secretary of State's initiative in requesting local authorities to survey the housing needs of their areas and to launch a crash programme of council house building. I put again to the Conservative Opposition —the unofficial Opposition in this Committee—the question that the hon. Member for Conway (Mr. Roberts) failed to answer this morning. He said that people had no choice between council and private housing, and I asked him how many people on council house waiting lists could in fact afford the type of private housing available.<br><br>
The <i>per capita</i> personal incomes in my constituency are half the United Kingdom average. How many people on these low wages in my area can pay £10,000 to £15,000 for a two-bedroomed bungalow, which is the going rate even in Dolgellau? When I first moved to Meirionydd, four years ago, I lived in a council house. We were one of the front-room families referred to by the Secretary of State, and we have been permanently in debt ever since, trying to pay for our own home—and we are in a fortunate position in terms of income.<br><br>
Perhaps the hon. Member for Conway is spending too much time in the gin-and-tonic belt of Deganwy. I think he should ask his constituents in Llandudno Junction, Bangor and Bethesda what they think of his attitude to local authority building. Perhaps I should invite him to come to the Lledr Valley to one of my Saturday surgeries in Blaenau Ffestiniog to see the extent of housing stress and problems and the number of applications still on the waiting list in those areas.<br><br>
I can assure the Secretary of State that he has our firm support and the support of all the district authorities in Gwyneth for his plan to expand local authority housing. I believe that Merioneth district council itself should have a target of 300 new council houses every year for the next five years. Last year's completions by the old authorities in Merioneth were nearer 50.<br><br>
These authorities are now adopting a points system for council house allocation. That is welcome, because in the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 76</span>
past rural authorities have not been using an objective method of assessing needs for council housing. Although this is not a central Government matter, I believe that it will lead to a fairer allocation according to need.<br><br>
There are one or two specific points of detail on the question of new building which I should like the Under-Secretary at least to consider. When he is having discussions within his Department and with local authorities on new building programmes, will he pay special attention to the effects on the type of houses built to Parker Morris standards and the cost yardstick? He discussed this subject when he met Merioneth district council on 22nd April and I know that it concerns other authorities, too. Parker Morris standards have ensured that local authority housing has the basic amenities, adequate room size and so on, but the operation of the cost yardstick in the past has ensured that the materials in the construction tend to be of far lower quality, and that results in a high cost of repair, which the housing accounts of many authorities have to face, particularly in high rainfall and in high wind areas, such as the area I represent.<br><br>
I welcome the decision of the Secretary of State to review the cost yardstick. I wonder how flexible he is prepared to make this yardstick, particularly in the kind of position faced by areas such as mine. Is it possible to consider introducing a repair grant for those authorities which, because of the operation of a cost yardstick in the past, have inherited deteriorating property?<br><br>
I mention briefly some specialised housing requirements that face certain social groups in Wales. I hope that the Secretary of State, in his drive for greater local authority building, will ask authorities to pay special attention to the need for sheltered housing accommodation for the elderly and the mentally and physically handicapped. Would the Under-Secretary indicate, if not this afternoon, at some other time, how many local authorities are planning new provisions for sheltered accommodation for the mentally handicapped for example? This is a matter where close liaison is required between the housing authorities and the social services departments of county councils. Too often community care is an empty commitment.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0381">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 77</span>
Next there is the need for a full assessment of the position of the homeless in Wales. I welcome the publication in February of this year by the previous administration of Welsh Circular 34/74 on homelessness. I hope that the Under-Secretary and the Secretary of State can indicate what progress is being made on the basic recommendation that the responsibility for the homeless should be increasingly transferred to the housing departments, although calling for close collaboration with the social services departments of county councils.<br><br>
I hope that the days are over when social workers have to plead over an eviction with a local authority and that we now have a better understanding of the syndrome of deprivation that affects so many problem families. How many authorities in Wales, for example, have appointed, or are moving to appoint, housing welfare officers, as suggested in paragraph 22 of the circular? How many authorities are planning improved accommodation for homeless families?<br><br>
I hope that no housing authority and no social service departments in Wales are breaking up families by taking the children of the homeless into care, unless there are specific social reasons for separating them from a parent, or relegating the parents and the children into twilight Part III accommodation, which only aggravates their environmental and social deprivation.<br><br>
I hope that the Under-Secretary can tell us that page 41 returns are now being replaced in Wales as a method of collating statistics on homelessness. I hope, too, that the periodic conferences, mentioned in the circular, with voluntary bodies such as "Help the Aged "and" Shelter " can discuss the developments that we are making in lessening the problem of homelessness. I hope that the valuable work of the joint working party on homelessness in South Wales, which was part of the survey area covered, is being maintained within the Welsh Office.<br><br>
I believe that the priority given by the Secretary of State in his speech this morning, particularly the priority for expanding local authority house building, is socially right. Our urgent need is for the planned programme of housing development which
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 78</span>
he mentioned. In implementing this programme, he will have our active support and, equally, if we feel there is any delay, we shall be equally active in bringing pressure on his Department.</span></p>
<p>5.5 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Grist</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for this opportunity of making my maiden speech in this Committee on the subject of housing.<br><br>
We have already heard from both sides of the Committee how large it bulks in the letters and complaints to Members of Parliament, and I think that there is a much greater degree of accord between the two sides of the Committee than some Members would believe. We are in agreement that too often housing becomes something of a party plaything. It certainly lays itself open to what I would call yah-boo statistics, and must plead guilty, in a past life, to being prepared to make up these statistics for other Members to fire.<br><br>
We all accept that the homeless are not interested in political theorising or philosophising. They are interested simply in getting a roof over their heads and as Members of Parliament we are certainly interested in finding it for them, be it what sort of roof it may.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Finchley (Mrs. Thatcher) stated on Monday that no Government had managed to get the supply of finance, houses, materials and labour into equilibrium, That is precisely what the hon. Member for Rhondda (Mr. Jones) said. I very much doubt whether any Government will ever manage to get those four sectors into equilibrium. That means, I fear, that we shall never have an entirely satisfactory housing policy. It is dishonest of any party to try and make out that it will provide a perfect housing policy.<br><br>
One feature overlooked today is the effect of interest rates. We have been talking in isolation, and we have to face the fact that interest rates—in this country that means in effect world interest rates—have an absolutely crucial effect on both public and private housing sectors. It is no use thinking that we can plan housing in isolation from these other factors. It has certainly nothing to do with what one hon. Member I think called "a money-maker's paradise."<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0382">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 79</span>
High interest rates are a reflection of high inflation, and I fear that until we can reduce the rate of inflation in the Western world, and reduce interest rates, we shall continue to have extremely expensive forms of financing of housing. They are extremely expensive, paid for over a long period, and in a period of high interest rates, that means a lot of money.<br><br>
I welcome the basic tenets of the Housing Bill, introduced earlier this week. One might say that its motto was "Improvement rather than clearance". That is something which I think we should all support. It certainly should apply with some force in my constituency in the central area of Cardiff. I welcome the Cardiff City Council's undertaking that it will investigate areas that were originally detailed for clearance. Those clearance areas were often unnecessary.<br><br>
The improvement principle for areas of towns or villages must be right. It is sensible in economic terms. It is certainly right in human terms to leave people in an area which they know and in houses which they own and love and which are near to shops. It is much better than pushing them out into new estates, miles away from any centre. That must be the right policy.<br><br>
I welcome, too, the tightening of controls over improvement grants. Personally, I should be happy to accept the upper limit of £25,000 for the price of a house for tax relief on mortgages. However, I hope that this figure will be adjustable as the years go by and not become stuck, despite inflation. That in itself would have a rather odd effect on houses falling below £25,000, which might be houses currently £8,000, £9,000 or £10,000, within a measurable time. There could be something of an economic disaster at that level.<br><br>
I agree with the hon. Member for Rhondda (Mr. Jones) that we should adjust the improvement grant limit itself to take account of inflation. Many people who have had long-lasting improvements carried out on their houses will have a nasty shock when the final bill comes in. Some people will be unable to pay for the improvements which they put in hand many months, or possibly even several years, ago.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 80</span>
I should like to add my weight to what was said by the hon. Members for Newport (Mr. Hughes), Bedwellty (Mr. Kinnock) and Aberdare (Mr. Evans). Indeed, I agreed so much with their remarks that I doubt whether I will agree with them on other subjects quite so readily as today.<br><br>
I add my weight to urging a much tighter control over the improvement work which is carried on by grants. The standard is often absolutely deplorable, as has already been stated, and the rate of completion of the work is equally deplorable. I am sure we all have constituents who are living in virtually tented houses while the work is carried out. It is absolutely disgraceful and can have an appalling effect on the nerves and general health of the people living in those houses. Grants should not be made available unless a proper completion date can be shown and can be tested by the local authority.<br><br>
I endorse the plea from the hon. Member for Rhondda for more labour. I hope that he will welcome the more flexible apprenticeship scheme which the building trades employers are, I understand, introducing later this summer. It will speed tin the supply of trained and skilled labour and may overcome some of the difficulties from which we have suffered in this respect in recent years.<br><br>
I welcome the increased assistance to the voluntary housing movement. But I do not honestly see that voluntary housing, although it adds a flexible element to the market—an element which is sadly needed with the increasing demise, if there is such a phrase, of the private landlord can provide more than a useful contribution to housing. It certainly cannot take the place of, or be a major threat in numbers to, local authority or private housing.<br><br>
Finally, I make a plea to planners. This may echo what my hon. Friend the Member for Flint, West (Sir A. Meyer) said earlier. I plead with them—and I am amazed that they do not already do it more readily—to imagine living in the areas which they plan, to imagine living in the area themselves. One can ask why they are not sent to live there themselves for a year or two to experience what they have created on the drawing boards.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0383">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 81</span>
Many Members will know the large estate in my constituency which is roughly called Llanedeyrn, although that name loosely covers more than it should. In many ways it is a very fine mixed modern development, mixed in one respect because the late Cardiff City Council had a policy for selling council houses to their sitting tenants, so therc is a much better social mix in the council properties than I fear we may have on the newer ones under the present Socialist administration.<br><br>
However, why, oh why, was that estate ever planned with so few community facilities? Why were they provided so late? It was a housing development primarily for younger people. Why, therefore, are there so few playgrounds or play spaces for youngsters? Why is there such a poor bus service? Why is there only one pub? Why is there no petrol station? On that huge estate it is necessary to go into the centre of Cardiff to find a petrol station. Why should parking positions on that estate be so placed that in certain areas if cars are parked, young wives coming out of their houses with their prams cannot get past the cars? That is basic planning and it is utterly ridiculous that it should occur in a modern estate.<br><br>
The right hon. and learned Gentleman briefly referred in his opening speech to the social problems that arise from bad housing. We must ensure that in any crash programme, or any other programme to build more houses, we do not replace one set of social problems by a new set.</span></p>
<p>5.14 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tom Ellis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to take part in this debate, but I found it so stimulating, and, as I understand there are a few minutes available, I thought I might take the opportunity of making a few comments on what has been said and perhaps putting in one or two thoughts of my own.<br><br>
My right hon. and learned Friend was absolutely right when he said that the top priorities were housing and jobs. He was right not merely because housing is our great social evil at the moment but because the two are inseparable, in ways more profound than may be apparent to some members of the Committee. For
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 82</span>
example—I say this in as kindly a way as I can—the reference by the hon. and learned Member for Denbigh (Mr. Morgan) to the survey conducted in Denbighshire and to the contribution in economic terms of the second home was superficial in the sense that that approach is not comprehensive. The argument boils down not to the kind of lopsided contribution a second home can make to an economy but to the failure of an economy to grow as naturally as an oak tree in the meadow, branching in all directions so that we have the jobs—not merely the right number of jobs but also the right kind of jobs, with the accompanying demand for housing indigenous to the locality.<br><br>
If one talks about housing in terms of the contribution to the economy one is, in my view, going about it the wrong way. For that reason, I was glad to hear my right hon. and learned Friend say that the two went together at the top of the priority list in his Department.<br><br>
There has been a surprising degree of agreement across the Committee on certain aspects, particularly on the feeling that housing is a long-term matter and that the sooner we all stop making party-political issues on housing statistics and so on the better for all concerned. I am sure that a lot of hon. Members will agree with that.<br><br>
The importance of realising how longterm the issue is at once shown when we see how considering housing in the short-term leads to all kinds of difficulties. For example, what about the provision of mortgages? My hon. Friend the Member for Bedwellty (Mr. Kinnock) berated the building societies as being responsible for the present high mortgage interest rate. I am not here to defend the building societies, and I believe that in order to do better in times of slump they did things at times of boom that it would have been wiser not to have done. There are, however, much wider considerations which depend for their answer on a stable long-term equilibrium, the kind of stability that the hon. Member for Cardiff, North (Mr. Grist) spoke about. In passing, I congratulate him on his maiden speech in this Committee.<br><br>
I agree that it may be possible to get that long-term equilibrium, but I believe
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0384">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 83</span>
that one has to travel in hope. The purpose of a politician is to be hopeful and to attempt to get as near the ideal as possible. The mortgage rate business is, therefore, tied up with stability.<br><br>
The whole question of the efficiency of the building industry also is tied to the slumps and booms which housing has experienced over the years. While one will, of course, get speculative builders— they tend to appear at times of boom— one reaps the whirlwind at times of slump. At the present time, I know that there are many reputable building firms in serious difficulty because of the liquidity problem which I mentioned in an interjection this morning. One highly reputable firm which employs over 1,000 people in Wales is in a desperately serious position and may well be forced to go to the Official Receiver if certain matters cannot be resolved between it and the Inland Revenue. If that happens, of course, it will mean the firm going to the wall, and 1.000 building workers will be out of work at a time when we claim that we are attempting to get our housing starts off the ground.<br><br>
That is one consequence of the slumps and booms. Another consequence, which, I think, the hon. Member for Cardiff, North (Mr. Grist) mentioned, is the quality of the housing estates which we now have. I have seen some estates in my constituency of which I am, frankly, ashamed. I can understand how it came about that they were built in that way. There was a desperate short- age of houses just after the war, and the man who got the medals from the Welsh Office, or whoever was responsible at the time, was the man who built up the number of houses per 1,000 of the population. We have long rows of barracks built since the war which I would not care to live in.<br><br>
The tragedy is that, the standard of building over the last few years—I am speaking of council building in my area— has improved out of all recognition, and some very imaginative schemes have been established because the great crisis period had gone. But we are once again entering a crisis period, and I foresee that it will be a question of building houses at all costs, with all the consequent lowering of standards.<br><br>
The trouble is that, when one gets up to speak, one begins to think of all kinds
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 84</span>
of matters. But my time is up, so I shall leave it at that.</span></p>
<p>5.20 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Raymond Gower</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not deny what the hon. Member for Rhondda (Mr. Jones) stated, that there are prominent political elements in housing, as in many other matters of public administration. On the other hand I am encouraged by this debate and the extent to which the views of hon. Members cross the barriers of party and politics.<br><br>
I commiserate with the hon. Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Wigley) and others who have been unable to participate in the debate in the time at our disposal, but several hon. Members have spoken and the Secretary of State has had a series of interesting, useful and pertinent speeches to give him a good deal of guidance from various parts of the Principality in his consideration of the way ahead in housing.<br><br>
I applaud the Secretary of State's enthusiasm and his obvious determination to do all in his power during his term of office to deal with our housing problems. I applaud, too, the emphasis which he has given to some of the outstanding housing needs. He will find that he will have not only the support of his own back benchers but also the broad support of all parties in his task of trying to persuade, cajole and encourage the housing authorities and the other various agencies to improve their performance in the months and years ahead. This is not an easy task because they are all different and their tasks are different. We have only to listen to the various speeches today to realise that housing looks different in the Rhondda from what it does in Merioneth. The problems are different in their nature, and that is not surprising.<br><br>
I hope that, in his determination to do his best, the Secretary of State will keep a watchful eye on the way in which his policy is applied, certainly in the public sector. I hope that he will achieve maximum growth commensurate with careful preparation. We do not, as my hon. Friend the Member for Flint, West (Sir A. Meyer) pointed out, want numbers of housing accommodation units irrespective of the amenities which go with them. We want a balanced development, certainly in the big estates.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 85</span>
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North (Mr. Grist) that it is valuable, if possible, to get a social mix, which usually results where there have been modest sales of some council dwellings to their occupiers. This has resulted in valuable improvement in some cases. In some of my own council estates I have noticed that, quite naturally, when a person has bought a house the first thing he tries to do is to improve it. I do not say that council tenants do not do it, too, but a tenant has less incentive to improve a property than does a person who owns it. Some of the most tragic scenes I have ever witnessed have been of people living in private tenanted accommodation who have spent money, somewhat foolishly in some cases, on improvements from which they could not benefit because, at the end of their tenure, they have left and have not had the benefit of so much expenditure of money and effort.<br><br>
Sometimes, where improvements have been made by people who have bought their houses, the process has been infectious; neighbouring tenants have imitated these improvements. It is valuable to have a social mix of this kind.<br><br>
The right hon. and learned Gentleman's intention concerning the purchase of private sites or houses by local authorities is an interesting suggestion. I am not necessarily objecting to the idea, but I have some anxiety. The reactions of people in Merthyr Tydfil for instance, the Under Secretary's constituency—I heard a broadcast recently—show that they are deeply anxious. They have paid high prices for their houses, and they are worried about the consequences of the council taking possession of some of the house in areas where they expected that the houses would all be in a homogeneous estate, having regard to the price they had paid. I only ask that the right hon. and learned Gentleman should be watchful in his approach to this matter and maintain as many safeguards as possible and not allow it to be done in a ham-fisted way.<br><br>
It is a truism—I hope that the right hon. and learned Gentleman accepts this—that all of us must regard housing as one of the main concerns of the Government and of the local authorities. As he implied, a badly housed family is often an un-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 86</span>
healthy, unhappy, discontented family, and, not infrequently, a problem family. On the other hand, good housing can reduce all sorts of strains; it can lessen the demands on the health service, it can increase industrial efficiency, and it often assists in the battle against crime and delinquency. I think that hon. Members on both sides take that view.<br><br>
This year was bound to be a difficult year for a number of reasons, not least because of the economic and financial problems which are not limited to the United Kingdom but are affecting most of the Western world. Indeed some of my friends who have recently visited some of the Communist countries have detected similar problems developing there, too.<br><br>
In response to the hon. Member for Wrexham (Mr. Ellis), who made a short and pertinent speech, I agree that one of the main banes of housing and other policies has been inflation. Inflation is a frightful problem. Nowhere has it applied more injuriously than in private housing. If we cannot immediately cure inflation, but can lessen it, we as a country—this would apply in other countries, too—shall be making a most important contribution to better housing in the future.<br><br>
This year, as I say, was bound to be a difficult year, for that reason. Also, it was bound to be somewhat difficult because of the hiatus—the pause, the difficult period—between the ending of the old housing authorities and the assumption of responsibility for the first time by the new. This would inevitably create problems.<br><br>
While objective criticism is always valuable, I feel that none of us, as my hon. Friend the Member for Flint, West (Sir A. Meyer), pointed out, should be too dogmatic. My hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke (Mr. Edwards) emphasised this, too, as did the hon. Member for Wrexham when he spoke of the danger of making facile political points across the Floor.<br><br>
I admit that I have my own predilections, and, if I were a housing dictator and a conjuror at the same time, I suppose that I should be tempted to arrange that 90 per cent. of our people would be owner-occupiers. That situation I should love to see, but I fear that that will not come for a long time. However, I am
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0386">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 87</span>
encouraged by the obvious predilection of many people in Wales for home ownership. They like home ownership, they want it, and I am therefore unhappy at the difficulties that some of them are facing.<br><br>
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke, I am not at all happy about the situation for those who want to buy their own homes for the first time. In my interviews, I sometimes try to discourage constituents from being too ambitious at too early an age. When a young husband of 23 or 24 contemplates buying a new house or bungalow for £14,000 or £15,000 and taking on a mortgage of £12,000—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Neil Kinnock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What can he do?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Gower</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the case I am thinking of, he has bought a much smaller and cheaper house in a side street. Instead of having a mortgage of £11,000 or £12,000 he has one for £5,000, which he can manage in his present well paid occupation, with his wife also earning. Some people are too ambitious at too early an age.<br><br>
Not only the young but some older people are facing great difficulty. It will not be solved by a sudden reduction in house prices. Indeed, this could create problems for people who have bought in the last two years and now have large mortgages. If there were a sudden fall in prices, these people would be placed in an intolerable position. The difficulties we face here are enormous, but if we can stabilise and prevent further vast and sudden inflation in housing, the right hon. and learned Gentleman will make an invaluable contribution.<br><br>
I understand some of the Secretary of State's criticisms, but I am glad that my hon. Friend the Member for Conway (Mr. Roberts) quite properly tried to redress the balance. Indeed, if he had not replied in detail, with some of the figures, we might have had an inaccurate picture. I do not think that the right hon. and learned Gentleman consciously sought to create inaccuracy, but that could have been the result.<br><br>
I hope that the Secretary of State recognises—indeed, he did admit it—that, whatever the defects in the public sector, there was an encouraging upturn towards the end of last year, and this has been sustained during the first few months of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 88</span>
this year. Thus, in some ways he has inherited a situation in which the figures are low but the trend is in the right direction, which is much better than the situation that our Government inherited in 1970, when the trend was downwards. At least, there are chances of improvement.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Conway was right to emphasise that about 49,000 houses were built or improved in Wales in 1973.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kinnock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it not a fact that the upturn that we discern in public sector building was coincidental with a downturn in the private sector and might not have been largely due to the downturn in the private sector, because people have been priced out of buying houses and the builders knew it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Gower</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There may be an element of that. I do not dispute it. But I believe that there were other reasons. Some of the authorities' schemes had been planned and were coming to fruition. There was that upturn, and it is continuing. The hon. Gentleman has underlined the obvious relationship between the two, and I want to see maximum encouragement in both respects.<br><br>
My hon. Friend was right to point out that, contrary to some of today's speeches, the 11,000 houses built in the private sector was the largest number ever built in one year. I hope that the right hon. and learned Gentleman recalls this, because I do not think that he or his colleagues gave—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Edward Rowlands)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He said so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Gower</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But with some reluctance. It is the highest figure ever achieved.<br><br>
The growth in improvement grants has been a significant feature of recent years —to 31,000 or more in 1973. This was acknowledged. I support the hon. Member for Merioneth and others who pressed for sympathetic and possibly individual consideration of those applications which have been left unsettled, sometimes because of delay by the local authority. I have one or two such cases myself, and my hon. Friend mentioned it, too. In some senses those are heartbreaking cases. I do not know to what extent the right hon. and learned Gentleman's
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0387">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 89</span>
powers enable him to take action in such cases, but I hope that he will do all he can. I imagine that a considerable number of cases exist. The hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick) referred to several.<br><br>
Like the Secretary of State, we are aware of the different needs. There are those who cannot or will not contemplate private ownership, and they will exist for a long time. There is the steadily increasing body of people eager to buy for the first time. There are, in addition, all the special categories of the elderly, sick and disabled.<br><br>
I welcome the £14 million extra that the Government will advance to housing authorities to help them, and likewise I welcome the Minister's appeal to authorities to press on with new schemes. We cordially support the degree of assistance already given by the Minister's right hon. Friend and by him to building societies. As I remarked, we look with some anxiety on one or two aspects of the scheme for purchase of private houses by local authorities. We ask for greater help for every agency concerned with providing finance for house purchase, such as building societies, local authorities and other agencies. I hope that as soon as conditions permit, the Government will reconsider the Macmillan formula, by which special help was given to those buying older houses.<br><br>
That action was taken some 15 years ago and made a valuable contribution that enabled people to buy the houses for which the building societies in those days were not readily advancing money. I suggest, too, that the right hon. and learned Gentleman might consider calling together the representatives of housing authorities, master builders and finance agencies such as building societies, to see what might be done to speed up the supply of housing and facilitate further growth in private housing. He has taken steps to deal with the public sector. I ask for similar urgency in the private sector, too. I therefore appeal to the Minister to look at that matter with equal urgency. We want a balanced picture.<br><br>
There are parts of Wales where fortunately our problems are somewhat different in kind and character from the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 90</span>
worst parts of London and the great cities in England. Of course, we have bad problems in the industrial valleys and in rural areas. But we are spared some of the worst horrors of the special housing problems of the great conurbations in England. Therefore, we must not be despondent. In some ways our task may be less difficult than in other parts of the United Kingdom.<br><br>
With a great deal of good will, and provided that there is not too dogmatic an approach to the subject, the Minister and the Government can go ahead with an assurance of a cordiality of support not always given in matters of this kind. We in the Conservative Party wish him will in his task. We want to see the Welsh people better housed. We want them to have better amenities, and we want this to be done within a growing and more prosperous economy.</span></p>
<p>5.39 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Edward Rowlands)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Many hon. Members have said that we should approach the subject of housing with a degree of humility. I certainly approach the task of winding up the debate with a degree of humility, because in many ways it has been a remarkable debate. Some of the best speeches I have heard have been made in the Welsh Grand Committee today by hon. Members from both sides of the Committee.<br><br>
I shall try to answer most observations. I shall not be able to cover every point. I shall not dwell on the subject of water, mentioned by the hon. and learned Member for Denbigh (Mr. Morgan). I do not like water very much. Although I do not live in the gin and tonic belt, I prefer gin and tonic, a drink apparently greatly drunk in parts of Conway, in the constituency of the hon. Member for Conway (Mr. Roberts).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wyn Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not even aware that it existed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Gin and tonic is not the subject of the debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member stretches the credibility of the Committee.<br><br>
I shall not comment on what my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdare (Mr. Evans) said about jobbing builders willing to tackle pyramid building if grants are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0388">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 91</span>
available. I can assure the Committee that it is not our intention to build pyramids, even for the tourist trade in his constituency.<br><br>
I want first to deal with the major aspect of the debate. The hon. Member for Conway somehow implied that the Government, through our published circular and our policy statements, had some kind of conspiracy against home owner- ship, intention or otherwise. Let me lay this bogey to rest once and for all.<br><br>
The Government are committed to the principle of home ownership as much as is any other party, and our record stands there to be recalled by all. We were the Government who passed the Leasehold Reform Act. We were the Government who introduced option mortgages. We have given £100 million a month over the next five months to hold down mortgage interest rates and also to assist mortgage finance for building societies. Local authorities are allowed to lend as much as they like to help home ownership, and it is no satisfaction to us to have to recount, as my right hon. and learned Friend did today, the present state of the private house market in Wales. It is not of our creation. It was not the creation of our circular, and it has not been the creation of any single action by the Government.<br><br>
It was a situation that we inherited and that existed prior to the Labour Party coming to power. We should love to go back to the days when mortgages were 6 per cent., or 7 per cent., and the average house cost £4,000 in Wales. Now mortgages are 11 per cent. and the average house price is £8,000 or more.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Barry (Sir R. Gower) spoke of a modest mortgage of £5,000. I have a modest mortgage of £5,000. Nearly a year ago it cost me roughly £39 a month. It now costs £50 a month and for a person on average income £50 a month is a large sum, to dock out of his gross weekly pay packet. I am sure that we all feel the pinch.<br><br>
So it gives us no satisfaction to see the present situation in the private housing market. We are quite unapologetic about taking action to save the situation. The action which has been under discussion today is the acquisition of sites and largely unsold private housing estates. This is not a policy which we adopted as such.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 92</span>
It is not a policy which we initiated to get nationalisation by stealth or public municipalisation. Many builders have been knocking on our doors and clamouring for local authorities and the public to bail them out.<br><br>
We are saying that we shall do it. We shall do it for two reasons. First, we cannot stand idly by when we have housing queues, as several hon. Members have said, longer than Members can remember in all their days as Members of Parliament. Secondly, we cannot watch large housing estates, half constructed with sewerage facilities and drainage already in, sterilised as a result of the market.<br><br>
I hope and pray that the market will improve, and I see from today's reports that there is a thaw in home loans and a gradual improvement. All our forecasts, all the evidence coming in from the builders, from those who have been in private house development, have been reporting a rather gloomy situation. Therefore, we are quite unapologetic in saying that we shall give every encouragement. The message going from the Committee, from the Secretary of State and myself, is to encourage local authorities and builders to get together as a matter of urgency to build wherever possible on sites once earmarked for private development.<br><br>
However, our main general policy objective in general terms is to get back to the housebuilding levels of the mid-and late-1960s when we were building between 17,000 and 20,000 houses a year with a ratio of 50:50–50 from the public sector and 50 from the private sector.<br><br>
What has gone wrong over the past two or three years is that this balance has been sadly tilted. I say that not because I am not in favour of record house building figures for the private sector, but because we now know, as our surgeries Saturday after Saturday show us, that private development cannot accommodate or cater for the needs of thousands of people in Wales. It is the lack of an alternative form of accommodation in the way of a local authority house to rent that is one of the causes of the real personal and social housing crisis.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wyn Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the subject of the turning point in public sector house building; would not the Minister agree
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0389">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 93</span>
that that turning point was January 1968 when there were the public expenditure cuts that included housing?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think so. There are a variety of reasons. I agreed with hon. Members opposite to draw a veil over the past if they wanted that. I can understand why the Opposition want to draw a veil over the past. The only advantage in looking at the past is to find what lessons one can learn from it. I believe that the Secretary of State drew some lessons from the past, particularly the immediate past, in outlining the policy statements for the future.<br><br>
What is now needed as a matter of urgency is a crash building programme. There is no pleasure in saying that, because many hon. Friends have expressed the concern and anxiety that I would express about the possibility of facilities not being provided, or building estates and not communities. I appreciate those points. But anyone who sits on a Saturday morning in his surgery knows that what those who come to us would dearly love to have is a house, wherever it might be—perhaps in Llanedeyrn, in Cardiff—an estate I know very well—or anywhere else. A home is the basic necessity, but it is a necessity that a large number of people are unable to obtain, or have the prospect of achieving.<br><br>
It is therefore a matter of curiosity and concern that J heard the hon. Member for Flint, West (Sir A. Meyer) say that he did not want any more houses built in his constituency. Considering that 1 recently visited the new Delyn district council, which covers part of his constituency—it certainly covers an area round his constituency—and found the waiting list of that authority was 1,450 people, I do not understand how he can be so sanguine about the situation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alec Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: More tents?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend suggests more tents. I did not find that. I found councillors who represent areas of his constituency and my hon. Friend the Member for Flint, East (Mr Jones) were saying to me—as every housing district councillor would say—that they urgently need more houses. I should not like to query the hon. Gentleman's assessment of the needs and problems of his own constituency, but I doubt whether he speaks
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 94</span>
for a large number of people who are desperately in need of homes in North-East Flintshire
The hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Edwards), and I believe others, said that we had not a national housing problem, but a variety of local problems. We have bath We have a national housing problem. There is a uniform problem in Wales which can be found everywhere—the need for more homes. The housing queues are all growing proportionately to population. In the whole county of Pem-brokeshire last year only 26 council houses were built. I know that the hon. Gentleman takes no satisfaction from that, and nor do I. It is both a national and local housing problem.<br><br>
Many Members have referred to the difficulties of cost yardsticks—I believe my right hon. and learned Friend has done much to allay the fears of the Committee in that respect—and of the problems of getting contractors. It is hard to get contractors to build even 26 houses in one year in any area, even with the special problems in Pembrokeshire. That is why we need a consistent regular annual building programme in each area over a longer period than one or two years —say over five years—with the prospect of offering continuity of employment and continuity of building to both contractors and to workers in the industry. I hope therefore, that the announcement today by my right hon. and learned Friend of a survey of grass roots requirements and the need to establish a consistent building programme over the next five years for each authority will be welcomed.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Conway wants us to have done it by yesterday, apparently. I must tell him that the previous administration repeatedly refused to carry out any form of survey of needs or assessment of needs, despite the number of occasions on which we asked them to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wyn Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It has been pressed for a long time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was never carried out, I am sorry to say.<br><br>
I was touched by the regular references to my previous intervention on housing as a Minister. I take some satisfaction from this and hope that the same degree of solicitude and attention is paid to this
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0390">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 95</span>
contribution. I recall looking at the speech, the main part of which was a plea that we needed to carry out an assessment of real needs over the next few years. The one real lesson of the past three years is that the absence of any genuine assessment of need by local authorities has led them to believe that they have solved the housing problem when it is clear that they have not done so.<br><br>
I shall now answer one or two points before turning to the final stages of my speech. They concern house improvement and the Housing Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick) mentioned the Housing Finance Act, particularly the lodger charge. The Government thought that the anomalies created by this charge were a monstrosity, as indeed were other provisions of that Act. I can tell my hon. Friend that the lodger charge will be swept away along with the rest of the Housing Finance Act as soon as possible.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Merioneth (Mr. Thomas) mentioned special housing and the problems of homelessness. That would be worth almost a Grand Committee debate on its own. I am glad to say that at least one in four tenders coming into the Welsh Office now are for special housing needs for sheltered accommodation and others. The problem of homelessness is, alas, still with us, and is still growing.<br><br>
I turn to the subject of house improvement. I come first to the extension of the 75 per cent. grant. Many hon. Members have welcomed this extension, although, naturally, some would have liked us to go further. It was a difficult decision to make on the balance of the use of the allocation of resources. If, as the figures indicate, every month of extension would cost £1 million in Welsh terms alone, we should have to decide whether one should carry on in that way, or redirect the resources to those areas in most urgent need.<br><br>
One of the sad things revealed by our evidence and surveys is that the 75 per cent. grant was as much a success in what has been demonstrated as in its limitation in the form it was introduced and the form of its operation. I was depressed at the start of my new responsi-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 96</span>
bilities to see the unpublished house condition survey for 1973. We are working on it to have it published, but it is a detailed and complicated document.<br><br>
The interim finding of the 1973 sample survey shows that, at that time, there were 150,000 houses in Wales, which would be considered unfit if this figure is correct. I have great suspicion about the figure and we have raised some queries. Even if that figure were modified, it shows that, despite the 75 per cent. grant and despite the fantastic rate of house improvement during the past few years, we have not yet been able to arrest a decline in the deterioration of housing stock in the Principality.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda said that at the present rate it would take 50 years to carry out the backlog of work in his constituency alone. For that reason we now have to direct the resources available on the house improvement side into areas in most urgent need of improvement. The 75 per cent. grant, with all its success, has clearly not gone to those most in need, or to the properties most in need of improvement.<br><br>
The action to be taken now is to ensure that, rather than being a passive grant-improving body, the local authority should be an active promoter and developer and, if need be, a compeller of house improvement in areas in most need of rescue. That is why we have agreed to reintroduce the Housing Bill with its housing action area concept, as a matter of urgency. With the support of hon. Members opposite, I hope that that Bill will become law before the summer is out.<br><br>
I take the point made by many hon. Members about questions of the application of the Housing Bill. The hon. Member for Merioneth said that we had to exercise it flexibly and that in his constituency a housing action area of 10 houses might be more applicable. I went to North Wales and I have given the assurance, which I confirmed in the debate on Monday night, that there is no reason why a small village scheme with about a dozen houses should not be a part of a housing action area concept. In fact, it will be vital in some of the rural villages of North Wales that that sort of

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 97</span>
small housing action area is declared and action taken.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bedwellty (Mr. Kinnock) put forward a number of interesting suggestions about the way in which the organisation of the Housing Bill should be conducted. His idea of housing action units within local authorities is welcome. In a modified form, it is what I have strongly recommended in my personal visits to housing authorities. There is no doubt that unless local authorities themselves take action on the Housing Bill, deterioration in our housing stock will continue, and we shall never be able to solve our housing problem, or even get it within manageable proportions.<br><br>
I come finally to the subject of second homes. The hon. and learned Member for Denbigh (Mr. Morgan)—he has disappeared, perhaps for a gin and tonic—spoke of second homes, as did the hon. Member for Merioneth and my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnor. The Government certainly would not support any witch hunt of those who own second homes. There is no value in that and there is no reason why it would succeed, or even be particularly helpful. What we are saying is that there is every possibility and every reason why local authorities should buy homes coming on to the market—potentially second homes—where their own housing need is paramount.<br><br>
That power has been available. Indeed, in the Dolgellau RDC, in the constituency of Merioneth, an extremely active policy was carried out by the local authority. Other authorities who have often shouted loudest have done least in this respect.<br><br>
I also outlined on Monday evening the application of the housing action area approach to potential second homes. This applies to properties that might fall empty within housing action areas and, where necessary, the housing authority—conforming as it should to the terms and framework of the Housing Bill—could compulsorily purchase those properties that might come on the market in order

that the proper and effective management of the housing action area could continue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dafydd Wigley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary talks of houses that may come on the market. Does that mean that councils may not acquire property unless it is coming on the open market?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not necessarily. It does not mean that they have to be empty houses. I believe, however, that this is where the most fruitful market will lie, because I believe that there will be a host of problems associated with acquiring houses which are already owned and the precious possession of people, albeit that they are outsiders. I am sure that the hon. Member for Pembroke would not like to have his mill house acquired. Each case will have to be dealt with on its merits, but the Housing Bill gives power to the authorities to take action where deemed necessary.<br><br>
I end on a personal note. It has been a privileged to wind up for the second time in my political career a debate on housing in the Welsh Grand Committee. It is a privilege because it has always been my main parliamentary interest, but I think—as all the speeches of hon. Members here today have conveyed—that the whole idea of democratic representation, of fighting for one's patch, of listening to the problems of one's constituents, of listening to people at home on a Saturday morning—what sickening stories we all have heard over the past few months of people who suffer from the lack of a home—has left an impression upon us all.<br><br>
Returning from my Saturday morning surgery I go home and see my own children in a good home—wrecking it, of course, but in a good home—and it makes me feel all the more determined, despite some of the procrastinations of today, to work and fight to start to beat the housing problems facing us.</span></p>
