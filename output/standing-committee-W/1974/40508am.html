<p><i>Resolved</i>, That the Committee do meet again this day at Four o'clock.—[<i>Mr. John Morris</i>.]</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it will be convenient for me to remind the Committee at this stage that the House has permitted the Committee to rise this afternoon not later than six o'clock.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. John Morris)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move
<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee have considered the matter of Housing in Wales.</p></blockquote>
My first privilege, Mr. Davies, is to congratulate you once again on taking the Chair. The second is to congratulate the two hon. Members, the Member for Conway (Mr. Roberts) and the Member for Barry (Sir R. Gower), as I understand they are hoping to catch your eye, Mr. Davies, and to speak on the Front Bench during this debate.<br><br>
Wales is facing, as we all know, one of the worst housing crises since the war. This is primarily the result of the disastrously low rate of house building in 1972–73—the worst since 1946—in the public sector. That is our start line, and it is from there that we move to examine the situation as a whole. The sooner that is accepted and understood, the better. Almost all local authorities report a massive increase in their waiting list, wherever one goes in Wales. The totals are 5,000 in Cardiff, over 3,000 in Swansea and Newport and 1,500 in the Rhondda. In North Wales, 1,900 in Arfon and 1,450 in Delyn.<br><br>
Wherever one goes, from discussions with local authorities, large or small, cities, valleys and in our rural counties, the same depressing pattern of growing housing queues has emerged. It does not matter whether one talks to housing authorities in Merioneth or Merthyr, pro-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
portionatley all are suffering form housing stress.<br><br>
Many young couples, priced out of the home ownership market, awaiting council accommodation with little hope of getting it, are forced to live with parents in overcrowded conditions and all the social complications they involve. The growing needs of what, for a better term, I must call "front room families" are filling our constituency surgeries time after time. We know the problem; we see it, day after day. Tension resulting from such overcrowding is, I am sorry to report, turning occasionally, and far too frequently, housing problems into personal and marital problems for very many of our young married people. These are the realities of life in the constituencies that we all represent.<br><br>
The private housing market hag not provided the alternative solution, as was once believed possible. Although the high level of private house building has prevented the total collapse of the housing programme in Wales, it has failed to make up the deficiency in local authority house building.<br><br>
Owner occupation has been placed beyond the reach of a very large number of people—particularly the young married couples with children. We all know that since 1970 the price of the average house in Wales has doubled. Some of us will recall the very pertinent Questions which were put down month after month by my hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, East (Mr. McBride)—to whom I am sure the whole Committee will send their best wishes for a speedy recovery. He followed the course of house building prices in Wales most diligently month after month, and the point which he has been making is only too regrettably true.<br><br>
That strikes home particularly hard in Wales, where we have such a strong tradition of owner occupation—the highest in Great Britain. Not too long ago, in many of the older areas, young couples could have purchased an older house for not far off £1,000 and improved it with a grant to secure a good home—it was a first rung on the ladder—but not any more; we all know that. Indeed, that kind of property is averaging £4,000 and more. The shortage of mortgage facilities and the high interest
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0343">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
charges combined with the astronomical rise in house prices have driven many young couples out of the home market, only for them to find that the local authority is unable to provide for them. Can anyone describe the situation of such couples except that they are caught in what I term the "housing trap"—the same kind of trap as the other traps about which we have heard recently?<br><br>
I should like to pose three questions to the Committee. As a good Presbyterian, I should be allowed so to do in the course of my sermon! They are questions which the Committee and the whole of Wales should ask and attempt to answer when we discuss the housing policies of the Principality.<br><br>
First, why has such a situation occurred? Secondly, what can be done now to alleviate the immediate problems? Thirdly, what are the long-term lessons to be learned from the sad story of the last three years? Those are my three Calvinistic points this morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cledwyn Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hear them endorsed by another good Calvinist, the right hon. Member for Anglesey (Mr. Hughes).<br><br>
First, why has such a situation occurred? It is now evident that following the high building programme of the 1960s—over 100,000 houses were completed between 1964 and 1970—many local authorities concluded that the end of their problem was in sight. I am sure most of us read the perceptive article in the <i>Western Mail</i> on 7th January which pointed out that local authorities did net foresee the dramatic change in the market which transformed the situation, and it is also true to say that few steps were taken to assess real housing needs—a point to which I should like to return at the end of my speech.<br><br>
This outlook accorded with the previous administration's philosophy in favour of private housebuilding. Additionally, the introduction of the complex and controversial Housing Finance Act absorbed the administrative energies and efforts of local authorities. We are paying the penalty of that today. At the same time, the housing cost yardstick, originally a valuable instrument of cost control, had become so inflexible—hon. Members have cases in their own con-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
stituencies—in a period of rapidly rising prices that it stifled local authority house building schemes. This is the practical experience of so many of us in our discussions with our own local authorities. There were few positive measures under way until 1973 to stir local authorities into activity. This has now been changed.<br><br>
Secondly what can be done to alleviate the immediate problems? Even in the first days of this Government, a clear message has gone out to local authorities to persuade them to build again. The Government believe that the only solution to the problem of the growing waiting list is to build more homes and to build them quickly.<br><br>
The council house building programme began at long last to revive in the second half of 1973. Approvals for housing authorities and new town corporations for 1973–5,265 compared with a bare 2,000 in 1972—confirm this, and I am glad to be able to tell the Committee that this upward trend has been maintained in the first four months of the current year. But they still do not meet the present need, as I shall indicate shortly.<br><br>
The Government are therefore urging local authorities to bring forward all the housing schemes they have in the pipeline, and they will do everything in their power to assist in getting these schemes under way so that plans and statistics can be turned as rapidly as possible into bricks and mortar, into homes to meet the needs of our people. Extra resources have been made available to enable local authorities to make an immediate further increase in their house building programmes. Needless to say, the maximum encouragement will be given to them by my Department.<br><br>
We recognise also that there have been and still are practical difficulties facing local authorities, particularly the problem of obtaining tenders from contractors in the face of the restrictions imposed by the housing cost yardstick. Further, we are embarking on a review of the cost yardstick, and we hope to make an announcement of a new system as soon as possible which will be more realistically linked to the cost of housing.<br><br>
In the meantime, my Department has been instructed to act with maximum
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0344">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
administrative speed to iron out obstacles and to obtain approvals for all schemes submitted at reasonable cost. My Department has been pursuing this aim vigorously since the Government took office, and I am glad to be able to tell the Committee that of the 5,265 dwellings already referred to in local authority tenders approved in 1973, construction work has, in fact, started on all but 70. That is an indication of the housing drive that is now taking place. I can also tell the Committee that following an urgent review by my Department it has been established that more than 2,300 dwellings are, in fact, covered by local authority schemes approved in the first four months of this year.<br><br>
I assure the Committee and local authorities that no administrative problem will be allowed to hold up the crash house building programmes which we would wish local housing authorities to undertake. There will be no red tape, and I have instructed my officials and technical officers to bring every problem that may get in the way of the programme to the attention of my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil (Mr. Rowlands), the Under-Secretary of State. For this purpose I would hope that he is "Mr. Housing" in Wales to ensure that this crash programme really does get under way, as I have already stated.<br><br>
I believe it my duty, however, to inform the Committee that even with all these efforts we shall be unable to shrug off the legacy of an appalling council house building record this year. We inherited a council house building programme which totalled at the end of 1973 no more than 5,000 properties under construction. That frankly means that we shall be lucky if council house completions this year exceed 3,500 to 4,000. This is woefully inadequate to meet the needs of all those families in the housing queue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roy Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. and learned Friend appreciate that this would barely meet the needs of Newport alone?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have already referred to Newport's housing situation—3,000 on the waiting list. I am most grateful to my hon. Friend. This is the dark and appalling picture that we have inherited.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
I wanted to make it clear, and my hon. Friend has endorsed my remarks, that this is pitifully inadequate, but it is our start line.<br><br>
I regret to have to report to the Committee that if the picture as far as local authority housing is concerned is gloomy, the prospects facing the private housing sector are equally worrying. Even before the industrial crisis and the three day working week, the writing was on the wall. Starts in the private sector in the last quarter of 1973 were 25 per cent. down on the previous quarter and on the same period in 1972. The effect of the industrial crisis has been to plunge into even worse chaos an already critical situation. In the first two months of 1974 starts fell by over 30 per cent. compared with the same period in 1973.<br><br>
It is clear that despite the urgent Government intervention to restrain mortgage interest rates and to provide funds for the building societies, this year will be a very bad one indeed for the private sector. We shall be fortunate if half the number of houses are completed in 1974 compared with the total last year.<br><br>
The Government will do everything in their power to assist private house building in the immediate crisis. The Government have announced a series of interventions to do just that.<br><br>
As an emergency measure to ensure that urgently needed houses continue to be built, to prevent unsold properties lying empty, and to save many builders from bankruptcy, the Government have informed local authorities that they will assist with the purchase by agreement of sites and homes where appropriate and helpful to meet a local need. I shall be dealing in a moment with the full financial implications of our housing policies as a whole, but I can say now that for these purchases I have agreed with my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer that extra resources will be available to local authorities in Wales. The basic objective will be to obtain the fullest public advantage of empty houses standing on largely unsold private sites and, by agreement, to persuade builders who have land available and who are prepared to build for the local authorities to do as a matter of urgency. Proposals involving some 1,000
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0345">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
dwellings have been approved or are under consideration in the Welsh Office.<br><br>
This is a new field for local authorities, and I would like the message to go from this Committee to the local authorities that it is my wish to encourage them to co-operate with the building industry to ensure that houses and—what I should say are more important than houses—homes do not stand empty or even half built or sites remain undeveloped.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tom Ellis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the disastrous situation which my right hon. and learned Friend has just outlined, would he say, so far as concerns liquidity and the building firms which are in serious trouble, what the Government propose to do to ensure that these firms are able to overcome their immediate problems?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What I have now spelled out will, I think, be of enormous value to builders as regards liquidity. There are—I have had figures, and my hon. Friend is turning up some of them now —right across Wales these estates built or half-built which remain unsold. People, on the other hand, are dying for homes. If some of these houses can be got off the hands of builders, the money will be in their pockets, they will be liquid and they will be able to continue building again.<br><br>
What more important step can there be than this to help the builders once again to become liquid?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Raymond Gower</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would it not also be extremely helpful to these private builders on private sites if the Government could provide extra money for the local authorities to advance on mortgage at competitive rates to enable some of these people who want to buy houses to buy them on these estates which, after all, were planned for private occupation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the mortgage position generally, the hon. Gentleman is aware of what the Government have sought to do and the way in which the Treasury has sought to assist the building societies to ensure that money is available and that the rate does not go up. As regards my hon. Friend's query earlier, there is a proposal which has been approved for the purchase in this way of 146 homes in Newport itself.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Neil Kinnock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I regret delaying my right hon. and learned Friend at this point, but it may save the time of the Committee later. Will he, in considering permissions to buy houses that were allegedly originally built for private sale, be very stringent in his examination of these applications, because the growing feeling in areas like mine is that there are builders who will build houses specifically with the idea in mind that when they fail to sell them they will be making approaches and offers to the council, hoping that the public fund will do what the private funds have proved unable to do?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising that point. Obviously great care has to be exercised here. Perhaps my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will deal with this matter a little later in more detail. It is important that we should not be put in the position of having to bail out the private sector, but one must weigh on the other hand the consideration that there are homes here and that there are people wanting and desperate for homes.<br><br>
I want to refer to the question of second homes, which has aroused a great deal of interest and, indeed, burning passion in many parts of Wales. Perhaps it would assist the Committee if I were to run over the ground.<br><br>
The question is frequently asked whether local authorities can acquire houses which come on the market and might be sold as holiday homes. No new powers are needed to enable them to do this. Part V of the Housing Act 1957 already authorises local authorities to acquire land or houses for the purpose of providing housing accommodation to meet the housing needs of its district. This applies whether there is any second home element or not. The cost of any statutory acquisition of housing will rank in the normal way as reckonable expenditure attracting the full rate of subsidy.<br><br>
Perhaps it is right to spell that out and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil pointed out in the debate on Monday, it is proposed to give local authorities powers to acquire compulsorily properties within a housing action area, to secure the improvement of the housing accommodation in the area as
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0346">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
a whole, and the well being of the persons for the time being residing in the area and the proper and effective management and use of that accommodation. While this provision is not specifically directed at second homes, some housing authorities may find the powers appropriate to deal with second homes in certain circumstances.<br><br>
Hon. Members will already be aware that the Government propose to withdraw all financial support from public funds towards second homes. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in his Budget Statement that tax relief would no longer be available on mortgages for second homes, and it is specifically provided in the Housing Bill that improvement grants shall not be paid on second homes. That perhaps completes the picture of our proposals.<br><br>
I come now to the cost of our programme. As the Committee knows, we are faced with a difficult budgetary situation, and the calls on public expenditure are many. However, we have been determined to give housing an overall priority. We have, in fact, increased the public expenditure provision ceiling placed by the last administration on housing. I have agreed with my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer that in 1974–75 an extra £14 million will be made available to local authorities in Wales to increase their housing effort. The larger part of this sum, some £9 million will be earmarked for additional houses, whether by expansion of existing building programmes, or by purchases from private developers. Wales will be receiving its fair share of the additional resources that the Government are making available. I hope that will commend itself to the whole Committee.<br><br>
I come now to home and community improvements which are so fundamental to the future solution of the Welsh housing problem. The figures speak for themselves. In the 1971 census it showed that nearly 25 per cent. of the housing stock in Wales lacked one or more of the basic amenities. We all know that within this overall figure many of our oldest communities have a much higher proportion. In most valley communities of South Wales, for example, the figures range from 30 per cent. to, in the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
Rhondda, as my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda (Mr. Jones) would be the first to tell this Committee, 50 per cent.<br><br>
I readily acknowledge that one of the very few bright spots in the last administration's housing programme—and I seek to present the facts as fairly as I can to the whole of the Committee—was the boost to house improvement given by the 75 per cent. grant. I am glad that we have been able to make an announcement extending the dealine of 23rd June for at least some of those householders who, through no fault of their own, have been unable to complete the work by the arbitrary deadline imposed under the previous legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alec Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that both sides of the Committee welcome the idea of the 75 per cent. grant, but on many occasions we were given figures of the number of grants approved. Is it possible to have the number of works completed during any period? Otherwise we may be talking about grants which were never really used.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State will check whether we can look at the problem posed by my hon. Friend and see whether we can provide an answer in the course of the debate.<br><br>
I realise that this announcement will not help all. Let me be perfectly frank on that issue. I believe, however, that it will make a significant contribution to those householders who could have most reasonably expected to have completed the work by 23rd June. As my hon. Friend said in the debate on Monday, we now realise that the general 75 per cent. grant in itself has not arrested the serious deterioration of our oldest housing stock, and new and more drastic measures are required to save our oldest and best loved housing areas and communities. That is why we have retained the concept of the housing action areas, prompted by our predecessors, in the new Bill which has been introduced as a matter of urgency. We felt that there should be no time lapse between the phasing out of the existing 75 per cent. grant system and the introduction of the new system incorporated in the Bill.<br><br>
My hon. Friend will say a little more about these aspects in winding up. However, I should just like to say this. One of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0347">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
the immediate lessons that can be drawn from the painful experience of the last two years is that house improvement is no substitute for house building. I think one of the most bogus statistical tricks that have been attempted, but which have not succeeded, by our predecessors was the totting up of grant approvals on top of house building, as if together they amounted to a massive housing programme. I am sure that in retrospect—and I say this with the utmost of charity —hon. Members opposite must be rather shame-faced about the juggling of these figures. I can tell them that such juggling provided no comfort for those waiting in the growing housing lists for the past two years. I think that is understood right across Wales.<br><br>
The third question I put in opening this debate was: What are the longer-term lessons to be learned from the sad story of the past three years? Our immediate aim as outlined today must be to get a crash house building programme going, and our longer-term objectives must he to establish a properly planned housing programme for the whole of Wales. Only in this way can we really avoid the painful experiences of the past two or three years. Only in this way can we overcome the practical problems of the house construction industry. Only in this way can we ensure that we do not have a boom followed by a slump process as we have witnessed during these past two or three years.<br><br>
I am therefore asking all housing authorities to survey, as a matter of urgency, their needs for the next five years, and to inform us what they feel their annual house building rate ought to be over this period. One of the greatest mistakes of the previous administration was to abandon any attempt to forecast and plan a regular programme of house building, particularly in the local authority areas.<br><br>
I am as conscious as anyone of past failure to make accurate estimates of need, as also the pitfalls in establishing targets. However, what we desperately need now is to establish our medium-term requirements and housing needs—figures not plucked out of the air from suspect global statistics but from proper grass roots assessments of housing needs.<br><br>
As a result of these assessments made by housing authorities we can really
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
begin to rebuild the firm partnership between Government and local authorities to ensure that the consistent annual housing programmes of authorities are achieved; that land will be available, that the building resources will be organised, that central government priorities on essential services to achieve 'these programmes, such as sewerage, are established in order that together we march in step towards achieving the housing objectives we all share.<br><br>
We, on this side, regret 'the speculation of the past two or three years in this area of social need and wish to establish housing, not as a purely commercial enterprise but essentially as a social service.<br><br>
The measures I have outlined today, and those we intend to bring in the coming months and years of this Administration, are designed and aimed to achieve that purpose.<br><br>
To my hon. Friends and me in the Welsh Office, jobs and homes in Wales are the number one priorities. Provisions of jobs in my case dominate my political life as a constituency member of Parliament. I am equally mindful of the vital importance of homes. What we will do, all of us knowing these needs in our areas, drawing on our experience, I hope, of all my colleagues in the committee, is to use what tools are available to ensure that we provide for those that so desperately need provision.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wyn Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I echo the right hon. and learned Gentleman's congratulations to you, Mr. Davies. I thank him for the congratulations that he has extended to me and to my hon. Friend. I regret the absence of my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Hendon, South (Mr. Thomas) which has been explained to you, Mr. Davies, and to the Secretary of State.<br><br>
We have heard a great deal this morning and, indeed, since the election, about the Government's housing objective. Almost every statement of them has been preceded by a general denigration of the Government's inheritance from the previous Government. My first role this morning is of course to defend the previous Government's record.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil (Mr. Rowlands) was in much the same position as I now find myself in in the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0348">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
Welsh Grand Committee of 21st January 1970. With his usual acumen, he selected for comment the smallest statistical fall he could find between 1968 and 1969 and said:
<br><blockquote><p>"That is not a dramatic fall. It is not the tremendous collapse of house building that hon. Gentlemen opposite seemed to indicate."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Welsh Grand Committee</i>, 21st January 1970; c. 48.]</p></blockquote>
Certainly that fall was not dramatic, but it was about the only one that was not.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman and the Secretary of State for the Environment have been using that word "collapse" again recently to describe the house building programme that they have inherited, including the 20.772 houses under construction at the end of last year, the largest number since 1967. At this stage all I would say to them is that such a description, this talk of "collapse", is hardly calculated to instill confidence into the building industry, a confidence which must not be sapped and which will be much needed in the difficult months ahead.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Hereford (Mr. Gibson-Watt) set the Conservative record straight in our Welsh affairs debate on 21st March 1974, when he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"…housing in Wales or anywhere else cannot be looked at only in the context of the public sector. It is the public sector plus the private sector. plus the improved houses that should he considered, because they form the total housing stOCk."— [OFFICIAL REPORT, 21st March 1974; Vol. 870, c. 1439.]</p></blockquote>
It is no use arguing, as did the Secretary of State this morning, that improvements do not count. We have a high proportion of pre-1918 dwellings in Wales —46·7 per cent., and 34·8 per cent. compared with Great Britain as a whole. Many of those dwellings have been saved from becoming unfit by improvement grants. We had a graphic account of the value of improvements grants from the hon. Member for Rhondda (Mr. Jones) in the debate on Monday evening.<br><br>
The totals of new houses completed and improved under the previous Government show a record that is extremely impressive, as I am sure most hon. Members agree. In 1970, the figure was 25,893; in 1971, 26,853; in 1972, 42,693; and in 1973, 45,902. Far from being a tale of neglect by the previous Government, those figures are a saga that can be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
sung with pride. They deserve an ode at the National Eisteddfod.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alec Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman is using this aggregation of figures, perhaps he can tell us whether he is including approvals of improvements grants or work actually completed. If it is only approvals, the arithmetic is meaningless.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am a fairly sure that the figures for 1972—the total figures which I gave, for example, of improvements, 27,923 have been taken—were more than approvals.<br><br>
When hon. Members opposite say, as they are so fond of saying, that public sector completions last year were, the lowest since 1946, why do not they add that private sector completions in Wales last year were the highest ever achieved 10,957, nearly 11,000 new houses completed in the private sector. Again I ask why right hon. and hon. Gentlemen do not acknowledge this record of achievement. It is not that they do not know, because the figures for the two sectors are published side by side.<br><br>
So they sit there convicted of being dealers in half-truths. When they attack us for the decline in the public sector, why do not they admit the point, made by my hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke (Mr. Edwards), that public sector starts have been declining steadily from 1964, and that they themselves, when last in office, nearly halved the public sector achievement between 1964 and 1970.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. D. E. Thomas</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could the hon. Gentleman tell us how many people on the council house waiting lists could afford the privately built accommodation that he is praising?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to that matter later. I do not think that the Government know the answer to that one.<br><br>
There has been very little acknowledgment until recently of the tremendous increase in the number of houses improved every year under the Conservative Government and of the part played by the Housing Act 1971. That Act made the 75 per cent. improvement grant available to development and intermediate areas. As a result of that Act, the number of houses improved shot up from 11,752 in 1971 to 27,923 in 1972. The number of houses
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0349">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
improved last year was nearly four times the number improved in 1969.<br><br>
I am saddened—this is an important matter—by the fact that local authorities in Wales did not take as much advantage of the Act as did English local authorities. The proportion of public sector improvements to private house improvements in England is about one to one, and about one to three in favour of the private sector in Wales.<br><br>
As the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydvil knows, I raised the question on Monday and he advised me to look at more recent figures, recorded in c. 109 of HANSARD on 6th May. They show that in the past 12 months or so local authorities in Wales have been active. The latest figures available to me are those in the housing and construction statistics. I have looked at the figures for the first nine months of 1973 and the point that I made is still valid. In Wales, the number of improvement grants approved were 6,331 for local authorities and for private owners in housing associations 17,536.<br><br>
The hon. Member went on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"We might not want to encourage them excessively, because the vital area, the salvation of the housing stock most urgently in need of improvement, still lies in the private sector, in the oldest owner-occupied properties and homes. If those are not saved the housing problems of the future will be very much greater."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 6th May 1974; Vol. 33, c. 109.]</p></blockquote>
There, if we need it, is a tribute to the value of improvement grants and a contradiction of the comment made by the Secretary of State.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kinnock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must have learned his trade in statistical juggling from the former occupant of the Opposition Front Bench in this Committee. From his knowledge of Wales, does not the hon. Gentleman recognise, first the high level of owner-occupation, especially of the kind of houses about which he is talking? That means that a higher proportion of applications is received from those private owners than from the public sector. Secondly, does he not agree about the comparative novelty of a large amount of public housing stock in Wales, which means either that those houses did not qualify, or did not need improvement?<br><br>
Thirdly, a lot of the older public housing stock in Wales was purchased from
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
such authorities as the National Coal Board, a process which takes time. The policy has had only five years to evolve. If the hon. Gentleman considers the valleys, he will find that the equalisation is taking place between former privately owned houses using improvement grants and houses that are still in private hands. The hon. Gentleman is completely mistaken about the picture in the Principality.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There may be some validity in the hon. Gentleman's observations about the greater extent of owner-occupation in Wales. On the other hand, I know from personal experience of certain local authority improvement schemes that were not proceeded with because the old local authorities were coming to an end. I accept that the hon. Gentleman's comment had some validity, but I submit that there is more validity in my comments<br><br>
Is it not unfair to say that it was only When right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite saw that political kudos could be gained from pressing for an extension of the 75 per cent. improvement grant beyond 23rd June 1974 that we in the former Government realised how much they appreciated that form of grant. There were plenty of feathers flying about in our debate on housing in the Welsh Grand Committee in May 1972. But there was no feather for my right hon. and learned Friend's cap for the highly successful operation of the 1971 Act and its extension that made the 75 per cent. grant available throughout the Principality until June of this year.<br><br>
One does not expect a high level of generosity from political opponents, but one is entitled to a fair presentation of the facts. I am glad that the right hon. and learned Gentleman was striving in that direction, as he told us this morning. We need a fair presentation from the Government both here and on television. Perhaps we shall have a truer, fairer picture of housing now that the prospect of a June election is receding and now that the Government are daily becoming more accountable to the electorate for the current situation.<br><br>
On the subject of improvement grants, we welcome the Government's decision to allow the 75 per cent. grant to those whose applications were approved on or
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0350">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
before 30th September. Since Monday of this week, we know why the Government cannot extend the concession—the Secretary of State for the Environment told us simply that it was because of the money, the cost. Nevertheless, as hon. Gentlemen have already pointed out, it will pose problems for a great many people, and I urge the Government to look at the matter again, even if it means cutting expenditure in some other direction.<br><br>
I urge the Government to do everything possible to curtail the period after 23rd June when only the 50 per cent. grant will be available until the Housing Bill is passed and implemented. As that Bill is a development of our Housing and Planning Bill, I am sure that the Opposition will give it a fair wind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Without being charged again with being unfair, I regard the hon. Member's plea in the last few moments as a sheer piece of humbug and hypocrisy. I remind him of a circular by the previous administration dated 14th September 1973. I quote:
<br><blockquote><p>The Secretary of State wishes to emphasise that there is no question of the provisions of the Act of 1971 being extended."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I have that circular before me. One must remember that there was an extension of the operation of the 1971 Act and the terminal date should have been 23rd June 1973; it was extended to 1974. I am glad that the right hon. and learned Gentleman drew attention to the date of that circular. It was a very early warning, 14th September 1973, that there would be no further extension beyond June 1974.<br><br>
The right hon. and learned Gentleman spoke of the Government's plans for further investment in housing in Wales. Of course we welcome the news of the £14 million that is to be available to local authorities. I do not think the right hon. and learned Gentleman explained that this was part of the £350 million already announced nationally; nor did he say over what period the £14 million would be available. May I take it that that is for one year only?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>indicated assent</i>.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We welcome that announcement.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
I wish to draw the Committee's attention briefly to the growth of recent Government financial contributions to housing in Wales. These contributions, both towards the building of new permanent houses and towards improvement grants, grew greatly, as anyone may see from Table 57 in the Digest of Welsh Statistics, page 42.<br><br>
In 1969–70, total Government contributions to new dwellings and improvement grants were nearly £8 million. In 1970–71, they were £9½ million. In 1971–72 they were over £12½ million, and in 1972–73 they were £12 …1 million—although I understand that the 1972–73 figures are not exactly comparable. Nevertheless, in so far as they are, they show a one-third increase from 1969–70.<br><br>
The Conservative Government's contribution towards new permanent houses was £10…9 million in 1971–72 compared with £5…9 million in 1968–69–nearly double. The Conservative Government's contribution last year towards improvement grants was more than double that of the previous Labour Government in 1968–69.<br><br>
The Commons Library staff have calculated for me how these sums compare as constant prices. Our total contribution in 1971–72 compared with 1968–69 —these being the last two statistically comparable years of each Government—shows that the Conservative Government's contributions were 46 per cent. greater. I repeat, that is at constant prices.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member asked me earlier whether the £14 million was for one year. I agree that it was. I said earlier that it was for the year 1974–75. which confirms what I said. There is a further point raised by the hon. Gentleman which perhaps I should also clarify. The £14 million—except for £1,250,000—is additional to the £350 million in England. That is my point—that it is an additional figure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to the right hon. and learned Gentleman. I believe that I clearly established the point of the tremendous increase in Government financial contributions towards housing in Wales during the period of Conservative administration. I can therefore once again say that the Opposition can
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0351">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
be proud of our housing record in Wales. The figures that I have given have not been challenged by Labour Members and so the record stands. If the Labour Government are proud of their record in 1970, they can be proud of ours, too.<br><br>
I come now to the present Government's strategy, if it can be dignified by that title, for dealing with the housing shortage, which undoubtedly exists. The Opposition at least acknowledge the need for new housing, although we are told there are now 30,000 new houses unsold in the whole country. I believe that the Secretary of State implied that there were about a thousand houses unsold in Wales, or at least under consideration for purchase by local authorities.<br><br>
The Opposition do not try to explain these away by saying that there is a statistical surplus of houses, as one Labour Member did in 1970. Nor do we try to explain falling housing figures in terms of a mythical diminishing demand. as the right hon. Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. Thomas) did at that time. Of course there is a continuing need for new housing. It is surprising that the Government have embarked, at least verbally, on a housing drive apparently without analysing the nature of the need. I believe that the Government are well aware of this.<br><br>
In reply to a Written Question of mine, answered on 29th April, asking the Secretary of State what steps he had taken to ascertain the annual number of new houses needed in Wales between now and 1980 and whether he would give estimates of requirements in the public and private sectors, the Secretary of State said that he had asked the Under-Secretary of State to initiate personal discussions with the new Welsh housing authorities and that he would be better able to assess housing requirements when those consultations had been concluded.<br><br>
That is all very well, but meanwhile the drive is on. Although Ministers were saying initially that they did not care particularly in which sector building took place, it is now clear that the main emphasis is on the public sector and that we are to have more council houses whether or not people want that type of rented housing in preference to their own.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
I was impressed by the speech of the hon. Member for Rhondda (Mr. Jones) on Monday. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"In my constituency 80 per cent. of the dwellings are owner-occupied. We are very proud that our people want to buy their own homes and have done so to such a great extent."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 6th May 1974; Vol. 873, c. 100.]</p></blockquote>
Yet he argued for more rented accommodation. I think that he was unduly impressed by the growth of Rhondda's waiting list in the sense that waiting lists for council houses certainly indicate housing needs, but they do not indicate whether people would prefer council accommodation or private ownership.<br><br>
As far as I can see, there will be little choice. There has been no further analysis of council waiting lists—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alec Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: and the Government have accepted, I believe, a figure of 40,000 at its face value. I have given way a great deal. I should like to press on because I know that other Members wish to speak.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will allow me one comment. Is the message to go out loud and clear from the Opposition Front Bench that they are against an increase in council house building? Does the hon. Gentleman confirm the words of the previous Secretary of State for Trade and Industry:
<br><blockquote><p>"I hope Conservative councils will take great care to resist the temptation to go on building council houses for all sorts of seemingly good purposes."</p></blockquote>
Is that still official Conservative policy?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, it is certainly not our policy that there should be no more council house building. I shall develop my theme and I shall come to the right hon. and learned Gentleman's point in due course when I speak about the public sector.<br><br>
Welsh Office Circular 111/74 shows how desperately anxious the Government are to increase the public sector housing stock at all costs. It provides for the acquisition of new houses from developers by local authorities for renting, as well as new houses completed in the private sector. There is also a statement in the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0352">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
circular that it may be possible to get some early contracts by attracting the services of private builders who own land for private house-building, but who in present circumstances may be prepared to contract to build local authority houses on their land.<br><br>
The Government's policy of extending social ownership of rented accommodation is at the expense of further development of owner-occupation. It is with us with a vengeance, and there may be worse to come if we are to believe the Government's prognostications of future legislation.<br><br>
We have always known that Labour Members were reluctant converts to owner-occupation. They revealed their true nature by opposing the sale of council houses, and they went along with owner-occupation only because it was such a success, especially in Wales where 554 per cent. of all dwellings are owner-occupied, a higher percentage than for Great Britain as a whole. The growth of owner-occupation represents one of the biggest changes in Wales in this century. There is no doubt in my mind that it represents a type of progress that is particularly dear to the people of Wales, and I do not have to quote any bards or songsters to enhance that comment.<br><br>
We are entitled to ask right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite what on earth has got into them to block this path of progress for the people of Wales at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Edward Rowlands)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What blocking are we doing?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It looks to me as though they have blindly followed the lead of the Secretary of State for the Environment, who is rightly concerned—as we were—with the priority needs of urban areas of social stress. Welsh Office Circular 111/74 is identical with the DOE circular 74, but are the problems of England and Wales the same? More important, are the best solutions the same? Renting is fine from the GLC, but it is owner-occupation—private ownership—that we want in Gwynned, Powys and many other parts of Wales. There is a clear preference for owner-occupation in Wales.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Row lands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Member give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have given way a great deal and I must get on.<br><br>
That is not to say that there is no scope for the new local authority rented accommodation, for of course there is, but the Government's emphasis on it is far too strong and it does not reflect the needs or the wishes of the people of Wales. They have a clear preference for owner-occupation.<br><br>
Furthermore, it goes against the regional construction forecast to 1977, commissioned by the National Economic Development Office, which anticipated a growth rate of 3 per cent. per annum in private housing completions between 1971 and 1977 and a decline of 10·5 per cent. per annum over the same period in public sector completions. That would give about 3,000 public and 11,000 private sector completions in 1977. These trends are clearly to be changed by deliberate Government policy. It is time that the people of Wales got to know about it, because to many an owner-occupier in future it will mean—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They are changed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What it may well mean is that if an owner-occupier wants to own a new house in a different district, he is likely to end up with a council house for rent, if he is lucky.<br><br>
My second serious criticism of the Government's house building strategy, following the fact that it is a blind drive on the public sector front based on little or no analysis of housing needs and preferences, and clean contrary to the preferences of the people of Wales as I understand them, is that I doubt very much whether the strategy will be successful, because the means to achieve it are inadequate. Even the Government have to admit, and do so frequently, in their circular that their measures will take time to work through. The phrase occurs at least three times in the circular and the Government are aware, therefore, that time is not on their side.<br><br>
When they consider the factors that delay house building—and one must remember that the time lag between start and completion has been growing and is now 21 months in the public sector
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0353">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
compared with 13 months in the private sector—they find that many of them are within their control. Expanded house building programmes depend on appropriate programming of main services, says the circular, and, of course, they do.<br><br>
Some of us have had the experience of being asked to jog the memories of nationalised industries to provide gas or electricity to sites that they appear to have forgotten. The Government's main concern currently, however, is water and sewerage, both to be provided by the new water authorities.<br><br>
There have been a number of complaints recently about the new water rates and the Government blame their predecessors. They know full well, however, that the power to change the situation is in their hands and they have clearly decided to leave matters as they stand and to review for the future. What steps are they taking, therefore, to ensure that main services are available for house building?<br><br>
Then there is the cost yardstick and approval procedures. The Welsh Office will do all it can, says the circular,
<br><blockquote><p>"to give speedy decisions and generally to avoid unnecessary delays in considering schemes".</p></blockquote>
Is that an admission that there have been such unnecessary delays? Be that as it may, there is a promise to speed up action in future—suitably qualified of course.<br><br>
How can time be bought? [<i>Laughter</i>] I have had a lot of interruptions and I am entitled to take a little extra time. There are some short-term measures for boosting the public sector completions, namely, buying privately built houses and sites, and of course we can expect a fresh surge of energy from the new housing authorities. The old authorities tended to postpone major developments towards the end of their lives and must take some share of the blame for the recent decline in public sector building.<br><br>
However, as public sector starts have declined steadily for the past decade and even in the 1960s private sector starts were ahead in eight out of the ten years and completions in seven out of the ten years, one can but wonder whether in backing the public sector produced houses the Government are not backing the wrong horse. To get maximum building they should have encouraged the private sector.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
Finally, it seems to me that the Government are going ahead without sufficient regard to factors that may well be outside their control to a certain extent. I am referring particularly to material shortages, which look like being acute this year. Plaster and plasterboard are still in short supply and steel reinforcing rods still have to be imported.<br><br>
I think that the three-day week has been excessively blamed by the new administration and they have not paid sufficient attention to material shortages. Material prices have increased on average by 46 per cent. between 1970 and the third quarter of 1973, and that excludes the expected increase in cement prices, which will certainly hit building particularly in North Wales. Shortages, rising prices not only of materials but of labour — up 69 per cent. since 1970— rising prices of land and of course of borrowing are major dampeners on house building, and they are bound to affect the public sector, too.<br><br>
How does the building industry view the prospect? After forecasting that capital investment this year in the building industry would be significantly lower in volume than in 1973, the April issue of the <i>National Builder</i> says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The situation should be developing more favourably during the course of 1975, given the prospect of a decline in interest rates and some easing of credit generally later in the year".</p></blockquote>
I think the <i>National Builder</i> is far more optimistic on these scores than I. Private housing completions, though, above the 1974 level may still be lower than in 1973. It went on:
<br><blockquote><p>"local authority housing may show some small improvement over 1974 as a whole because tenders approved in the second half of 1973—under a Tory Government—were substantially higher."</p></blockquote>
This is attributed to the exemption of housing from the Conservative Government's expenditure cuts, unlike the all-embracing cuts suffered under the last Labour Government in January 1968. That is the view of the industry.<br><br>
To sum up, I began by referring to the last Government's record, which was very exciting, especially in the area of improvements. I know whole villages that have been renovated as a result and scores of first homes, where families have lived for generations, that have been given a new lease of life. We must not lose sight of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0354">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
the use made of these grants in the abuse of the grants.<br><br>
There is our record of housebuilding for owner-occupation and the figure of 11,000 for last year. The advances in both these areas were advances that were needed by, and had the full backing of, the people of Wales. The emphasis now is on public sector building. There is need for it up to a point, although most people would prefer to own than to rent. But if it is a question of a home to rent or no home at all, people would obviously prefer to rent.<br><br>
I wish the Government success in their drive for new housing, but let them not forget the order of preference. In the end, what people want is a home that not only can they call their own, but which will be theirs in the fullness of time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I am to call all who wish to speak, I hope that hon. Members will have due regard to the length of speeches. May I also mention that I have received an apology from Mr. Deputy Speaker, who, as the Committee will have observed, accompanied me on the platform for the first part of this meeting. As a long-standing member of the Committee, I am sure that hon. Members will join me in congratulating him on his appointment to such a high office.</span></p>
<p>11.43 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roy Hughes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Member for Conway (Mr. Roberts) on what I believe is his maiden speech from the Opposition Front Bench. I do not wish to be uncharitable to him, but after listening to him I cannot forecast any long-term future for him in that capacity.<br><br>
In the earlier part of his speech the hon. Member for Conway made great play of the success of the last Government with improvement grants. In my own area there have been many dissatisfied customers among people who have taken up this scheme. Much greater control is needed, particularly bearing in mind all the millions of pounds of public expenditure involved. We should have better value for money. We know that this work essentially has to be carried out by small builders. But, as I pointed out in the debate in the House on Monday
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
night, too many "cowboys" have got in on the act. They have taken ordinary people for a ride. I feel that it is our job to see that local authorities have far greater control over these builders and the scheme generally.<br><br>
Housing is the gravest social problem of our time. It has become an intolerable scandal. I make no apology to the Committee for speaking in such emotive terms. Each year, we know that the number of new houses being completed is falling. I was glad to hear the slightly more encouraging news given by my right hon. and learned Friend in this respect. We know, too, that we have had soaring house prices in recent years. It has now become almost impossible for an average wage earner to obtain a mortgage to buy his own home. I would not underestimate in any way the natural desire of people to own their own homes, in contradiction to what the hon. Member for Conway said.<br><br>
The problem basically as I see it is about the allocation of resources. The house building know-how is there and I was glad to hear my right hon. and learned Friend speak of the additional funds to be allocated to local authorities for this purpose. However, much more still needs to be done, as I am sure he will readily agree.<br><br>
When one looks at the proportion of public expenditure allocated to housing in the past 20 years, one finds that it has fallen from 6·8 per cent. in 1952 to 5·3 per cent. in 1972. I am speaking about the country as a whole and not specifically in Welsh terms. There has also been a mortgage famine, with rising interest rates, and that has been harmful to new private building prospects.<br><br>
I turn now to building societies. They have not exactly been a success story in recent years. I have no wish to debate the merits of any takeover of building societies by the Government. However, stricter control is needed, together with the creation of a stabilisation fund.<br><br>
Turning to the public sector, we know that completions are at a low ebb and that waiting lists are soaring at present. As has been mentioned already in Swansea, Cardiff and Newport, it looks as if there are clear indications from those waiting lists of the fact that insufficient
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0355">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 29</span>
priority has been given to housing. We know—if I may philosophise for one moment—that man needs food, clothing and shelter in order to survive. Therefore, housing is one of the three basic needs. When we refer so glibly to the affluent society in which we allegedly live, with all its "mod cons", it is well to remember that a lot of people are losing out.<br><br>
On 4th February this year I initiated an Adjournment debate in the House on the housing situation in my constituency. I gave a number of specific examples of deplorable conditions in which people are living at present. 1 repeat that they were only examples, because when I take up these specific cases, I am told by the housing manager that many other people in the town are living in similar conditions.<br><br>
For some years the housing situation in Newport has given me grave cause for concern. An insufficient number of houses have been built, and many families have suffered badly as a result. One hears of damp houses and of parents taking their children to the hospitals with bad chests. Likewise young housewives with stress conditions attend to St. Cadoc's, the local mental hospital. I have quoted instances of mice crawling over children in their beds, houses beimg pulled down around them, with playing facilities almost non-existent. What an indictment this is of the type of society in which we live.<br><br>
Up to now the system of allocation in Newport has been based on the length of period on the waiting list. Even in the gravest housing cases, this list has been extended over three years. Exceptions have been made only after the most stringent medical evidence. Next month the new authority will introduce a points system. I hope that this will improve the situation and that these deprived families will now be helped.<br><br>
There now seem to be signs of improvement in Newport, in as much as many houses are being built. I urge on my colleagues, and the local authority in Newport, to press on with this work and give it the utmost priority.<br><br>
Since 1st April we have had local government reform which will be costly to ratepayers and taxpayers. One receives many complaints against the local
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
authority about housing problems. As I have said, I have been concerned with the housing department and, to some extent, with the way it is administered. One does not wish to attack public officials. We all appreciate their difficulties over lettings. But instead of the jargon one gets, what is needed for the person living in these conditions is a sympathetic letter, and a reply angled towards the individual case which gives a little hope to such people.<br><br>
One notices, too, that chief officers of local authorities are not now signing letters individually. Our Ministers always do so. I praise the Civil Service; they have a separate file for complaints from Members of Parliament, and this is quite right.<br><br>
I return to the point from which I started. There must be a massive increase in house building in the public sector. This, in turn, will relieve the situation in the private sector, as I will never believe that there is any division of interest here between the two sectors. I hope there will be no further delay and restriction to the cost yardstick scheme. I was glad of the information which the Secretary of State gave the Committee this morning.<br><br>
Then there is the basic question of the supply of land. Again, without arguing the pros and cons of the nationalisation of building land, I say that the power must be there to see that adequate land is available for house building.<br><br>
In our debate on Monday in the House I noticed that little detailed attention had been given to the actual organisation of the building industry. We have heard talk about liquidity and so on this morning, but there is this great need to attract craftsmen back to the industry. Certainly there is a need to train more apprentices, in order that craftsmen will be available in the future. As for the building industry, there is need for a certain amount of reorganisation. Whether it should be through some national housing corporation in the future or more direct labour schemes, I do not know, but certainly something needs to be done. We need to ensure also that adequate supplies of building materials are available.<br><br>
In conclusion, surely it is not beyond the wit of man to bring all these factors
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0356">Image</span>

together. We must get our priorities right and solve this housing crisis.</span></p>
<p>11.56 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Anthony Meyer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Newport (Mr. Hughes) did well to remind us that a debate on housing is basically a debate about people and their fears and anxieties and the daily miseries they have to put up with. I suggest that the finger of blame for this situation should be pointed not at my party or the party opposite but at all of us in politics and public life for housing policies over decades which have aroused, and cruelly aroused, expectations that could never possibly be fulfilled.<br><br>
I was glad that the hon. Member took the debate away for a moment or two from a discussion of crude totals of housing completions and starts. These figures are totally meaningless in a Welsh context. They may be meaningful in the context of one constituency, but totally meaningless in a Welsh context. Were the present Government to succeed in building 5,000 houses in my constituency during the coming year, it would, no doubt, look very pretty in the statistical tables. But it would do nothing to improve the situation in my part of the world.<br><br>
It would drag in 5,000 house owners from outside Wales who would probably be working outside Wales, and be a net drain on the local revenue. It would probably only complicate the housing situation in the area from which they came, and it would certainly make no contribution to the housing situation in my part of the world where, frankly, our need is not for more houses but for more public facilities—schools, community centres, shops, pubs and the rest. It is, therefore, pretty meaningless to discuss this matter in terms of global totals.<br><br>
But, if we are to talk for a moment about global totals, I am glad that my hon. Friend the Member for Conway (Mr. Roberts) laid such stress on the value of the contribution made by the policy of successive Governments on improvement grants. I think I am right in saying that the first step in this direction was taken by Mr. Greenwood—Lord Greenwood as he now is—when he began the policy of reclaiming decayed property which, without subvention, would fall into total dis-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
repair. I am glad that the previous Conservative Government laid increasing stress on this.<br><br>
There are areas where there is an urgent need for the building of new houses, but there are many other areas where far higher priority can be, and should be accorded to doing up old property which is capable of being made agreeable. During the last election campaign, I visited a row of houses in Mold which were as delightful and attractive as any row of houses could be—all of them condemned and at the mercy of the itchy fingers of the planner, who was longing to pull them down and put in their place some glass and concrete horror from which, logically, people could only hurl themselves from the balcony and commit suicide. People do not want to live in what the planners have been trying to give them during the recent decades. They do not want to live in great multi-storey blocks. Every day, as I travel to my constituency through the borough of Flint and I observe the two ludicrous skyscrapers stuck up into the sky in an area where there is no great shortage of building land, I am reminded of the inexcusable vanity and folly of housing planners who insist on giving people what —the planners think is good for them and take no notice of what people want. People want to go on living where they have been living. They want familiar surroundings. They want shops round the corner and a pub near by. They want the neighbours they have known all their lives.<br><br>
We are, I am glad to note, rapidly switching the emphasis away from the policy of mass demolition. I was glad that the Secretary of State for the Environment described himself the other day as a passionate opponent of indiscriminate clearance. More power to his elbow.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Entlyn Howson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it not right that the bulldozer era in the post-war period destroyed hundreds of thousands of houses that could easily have been improved? Further, did not that create the housing shortage? The hon. Gentleman is right. Everyone was to blame.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir A. Meyer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I could not agree more with the hon. and learned Gentleman. When I first came into politics, a young couple would begin their married lives in a fairly run-down second-hand house
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0357">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 33</span>
that they probably picked up then for £1,000 and obtained a mortgage on most of it. Governments of both parties have been busy sweeping away those perfectly fit dwellings and then boasting that they have done a splendid job of slum clearance. I confess that I have now reached the point of wishing to reach for my gun when someone starts talking about slum clearance.<br><br>
I echo what the hon. Member for Rhondda (Mr. Jones) said in the debate in the Chamber on Monday about improvement grants. I raise on loud cheer—not more than one—at the Government's decision to make a limited extension of the period for the 75 per cent. grant. I hope that, when they study the possibilities open to them, they will have second thoughts and will come to the conclusion that a further and wider extension of the scheme might be allowable. I am sure that they would find it good value for money. When we consider the relation between the average cost of making a house habitable through improvement grants compared with the cost of building a new house—I think the ratio is something like 200 to one—we realise that that policy has everything to commend it.<br><br>
This is, above all, an area in which it behoves all of us to be very modest. Sir William Armstrong said the other day that Governments flatter themselves that they have a vast amount of influence, and, thank God, they have very little. In housing policy, the influence of successive Governments has been almost uniformly disastrous, at any rate since the time of the First World War. It has been disastrous for one simple reason, that the competition between both parties, to boast that they have done more for housing than their predecessors or their successors, has all been based on trying to convince people that they can have a house for purchase or rent at a cost in resources lower than is actually required to provide that house.<br><br>
If individuals believe that they have a sacred right to a house cheaper than it actually costs to provide it, then ineluctably we as a community must believe that we have a right to housing cheaper than it can possibly be provided, which means that, as a community, we are simply not prepared to put into hous-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
ing the resources necessary to house our people properly.<br><br>
I submit that hon. Members on both sides should be thoroughly humble in their approach to the problem. We ought to neglect no sensible way of helping people with what are individual problems. We should abandon ideology on both sides, and think of this purely in human terms.</span></p>
<p>12.5 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Caerwyn E. Roderick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Flint, West (Sir Anthony Meyer) has once again not disappointed us in producing some surprises. He always amazes us in his approach to any subject, and, whereas there were some points on which I could agree, I am surprised to learn that he wants no more houses in his constituency. Perhaps that is something the Welsh Office should consider. He contended that an influx of houses would be no use. He said that his constituency did not need more houses. I know that, as politicians, we are prone to exaggeration, and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not want that to go on the record.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir A. Meyer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I would.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roderick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Oh, indeed. I hope it will.<br><br>
First, I welcome the Secretary of State's statements on the housing cost yardstick. This follows up the statement made in the circular to which he referred. But I hope that in the meantime, when conducting their review of the system, the Government will be exceptionally generous in their outlook and that they will use their good sense in accepting reasonable costs for additional allowances—as mentioned in that circular.<br><br>
We have had many problems with the housing cost yardstick, and I am glad that these problems have now been recognised. They have held up jobs. The hon. Member for Conway (Mr. Roberts) mentioned this and I think he was trying to score a point, but, surely, it has been holding up jobs in the past under both administrations. There was nothing particularly political about that.<br><br>
I take exception with the hon. Gentleman on his comment that the Welsh Office circular 11/74 was identical to the Department of Environment Circular 70/ 74. If the hon. Gentleman traced back
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0358">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 35</span>
in the period of office of the past administration, I wonder how many times he would find different circulars had been put out on the same subject from those two Departments? Was it not the practice to have a common policy in England and Wales? The Welsh Office was simply an issuing station for the circular, and there was no reason for the policy to be substantially different.<br><br>
I welcome the new emphasis and the more positive and aggressive powers being given to local authorities in housing—particularly the new emphasis on local authority housing. The hon. Member for Conway ignores an important point if he does not recognise our need for much more to be done in the form of of local authority housing. The hon. Gentleman does not recognise the present day cost of private houses. It debars so many of our people from good housing which they cannot afford to purchase. True, people already in private houses are not so much affected by rising prices, because if they need to move they sell at a higher price in order to buy at a higher price The people most affected are those buying for the first time, and they are completely put out of the market. I do not know how I should manage to buy a house today if buying one for the first time. It is almost impossible. Those are the people we should care most about.<br><br>
I welcome the purchasing of new private houses by local authorities. I know of areas where estates have been built and the builder has had to slow down the building because he cannot sell. If the local authorities can play a part here, so much the better. But I join in the warning that we do not want local authorities to be paying out too freely—they must beware of being taken for a ride, so to speak. The prices they pay must be realistic.<br><br>
There has been very little said today about the action taken by the Government on mortgages. Fortunately, that action appears to have been appropriate and we are at least halting the rise in interest rates. I look forward to the time when he can reduce them. High interest rates cannot be tolerated much longer.<br><br>
The rent freeze has not been mentioned. Many of my constituents welcomed the immediate action on the part
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
of the Government in bringing the Housing Finance Act to a standstill, because another increase was just about due. The Government are to be applauded for their prompt action in that respect.<br><br>
There is, however, one matter in that connection which affects and annoys many of my constituents, namely, the so-called lodger charge. Under the old local authorities, many of them paid an extra 50p to £ 1 per week rent to cover a "lodger". Often, that lodger was a son or a daughter, who subsequently moved out. These people are still paying that charge under the Housing Finance Act, and all our entreaties to the previous administration to correct this anomaly were unsuccessful. What do my hon. and right hon. Friends propose to do about it? My constituents cannot tolerate it, and we shall have a difficult time ahead if this continues much longer. For a person without a lodger to pay the charge and see a neighbour in similar circumstances not paying it is quite ridiculous.<br><br>
Now, second homes. About two years ago in the House I suggested that local authorities might step up the purchase of second homes, be they for renting on a long-term—if there is a demand in the area—as holiday homes, or for other purposes on a short term. They could well be involved in this matter. There is much condemnation of second homes for holiday purposes, used infrequently for weekends, because this drains villages of their lifeblood. There may not be a demand for local people to live in them, but they should be given the chance. We really ought to see whether local people want them. I know of many cottages in locations so remote that no one could live in them permanently and go to work. All right. But the opportunity should be allowed. Often, local people cannot afford to buy, but the local authority might do so.<br><br>
I plead for that course for the simple reason that the houses would be occupied for longer periods if they were rented to different people all the time—during the summer, for instance—rather than have one person visiting them infrequently. This would be useful to keep people in the communities, albeit different people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. D. E. Thomas</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Member agree that, in the letting of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0359">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 37</span>
second homes, local authorities in areas suitable for recreation should give priority to people living in inner city areas and areas of housing stress? At present we find that people living out in suburbia in good first homes are using the second homes, but there might be a case for recreational development, using second homes in remote areas for this purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roderick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with the hon. Member. They could be used for a social purpose of this nature to relieve not only housing stress in the cities but social stress, the stress of life which those people suffer so much. Coming through on the train to Paddington and seeing the circumstances in which people live in high-rise flats, I am baffled that children can be brought up in such circumstances without a breaking point being reached. I think we can do much more in this sphere.<br><br>
My right hon. and learned Friend pointed out that the local authorities already have the necessary powers. I ask him to remind them strenuously to pursue this objective. Will he keep pressing them to use these powers?<br><br>
I welcome the withdrawal of mortgage tax relief and improvements grants for second homes. Those measures were not intended for that purpose. They were intended to assist people to house themselves, and it is right and proper that they should be withdrawn.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Conway spent most of his time on improvement grants, and I think he was less than generous in not acknowledging the extension of the grant period. I shall be less than generous in saying that I think the dates have been a little tight. I think it is fair that we should not go on further in accepting approvals, but I think that the date of acceptance runs a bit close in that one could reasonably have expected many of these jobs to be completed in six months if it had not been for the emergency situation in which we found ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir A. Meyer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman, like me, totally baffled in trying to understand why there should be any terminal date for these improvement grants? I just do not understand why it should not be made an open-ended commitment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roderick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should certainly like to see them extended, but I acknowledge
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 38</span>
that if there are limited funds available the resources have to be used accordingly. Under the new Bill there will be provision in a different capacity for using them. This is my understanding of the situation, but I have no doubt my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil (Mr. Rowlands) will elaborate on that later. I should still have liked, say, three months' further extension in that people having approval in December could well have expected the job to be finished by June if it had not been for shortages of materials and other resources.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir R. Gower</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman suggested that people who apply in future for the equivalent of the present improvement grant, the 75 per cent., will have some other alternative remedy to assist them. Can he elaborate on that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roderick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely, the hon. Member has read the Bill. In the Bill there is reference to housing action areas and various other means of extending this kind of work in certain spheres. I am sure that the hon. Member will have an opportunity of saying what he thinks ought to be done, and that my hon. Friend will reply to him. My understanding is that there will be other sources from which help can be sought.<br><br>
Could we have a closer definition of housing action areas? I am not too clear how they will apply. Will they apply to larger conurbations or will they cover very small localities in rural areas? I know that we have had a debate about whether they should apply to the whole of Merthyr, the whole of Rhondda and so on, but I am wondering whether hamlets may be regarded as housing action areas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edward Rowland</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roderick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My understanding has tended to be that they apply to urban conurbations, but if they can apply to very small areas—to a street, for example —I should like my hon. Friend to clear this up and give us a closer definition. There are rural areas which we do not think of as housing stress areas, yet they constitute a housing problem in that the property there is run down. I should like to have more information about that side of the matter.<br><br>
Finally, could the Secretary of State look more closely at the quality of work

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 39</span>
that has been done by certain builders under improvement grants? This has been mentioned earlier. Some work that has been done for local authorities that I know of has been shoddy, very often because the contractor employed and the contract have not been studied sufficiently closely. The conditions under which some of the jobs have been undertaken have been deplorable. People have suffered agonies for weeks on end. We want to take a much closer look at the contractors and the contracts. I should welcome my right hon. and learned Friend's examination of this subject.</span></p>
<p>12.19 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Geraint Howells</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank you, Mr. Davies, for calling me to make my maiden speech in the Welsh Grand Committee. I feel it an honour and a privilege to stand here as the Liberal Member for Ceredigion.<br><br>
I listened with interest this morning to the Secretary of State making a first-class speech. I endorse a good deal of what he said, but I am sure that a similar speech was made in 1970, when the Opposition were in Government. and I am sure that, after the next election, we shall hear a similar speech again. [<i>Interruption</i>.] The hon. Gentleman should be careful what he says about Mid-Wales, because he is losing ground there.<br><br>
I agree with the hon. Member for Flint, West (Sir A. Meyer) in taking the discussion to some extent away to the rural parts of Wales. In company with many hon. Members here present, I represent a rural constituency, and I know that we have a major problem in our rural areas. We have talked about rural depopulation in Mid-Wales for decades, due to lack of job opportunities. However, I think that there is another reason why people, young and old, leave Mid-Wales for the towns and cities. The main reason, in my opinion, is that in the countryside we are deprived of adequate services, such as rural bus services, homes, water, sewerage and other essential services.<br><br>
Today we are discussing houses, and homes are essential, but the right hon. and learned Gentleman should look at the planning problem in rural areas, which is unique to Montgomery,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 40</span>
Cardigan, Merioneth as well as to other parts of Mid-Wales. In my opinion, we need a less restrictive planning and development policy for these areas. I ask the Minister to look at this. It is a particular problem in Ceredigion.<br><br>
Many applications have been refused because there are no sewerage facilities in many of our villages in Mid-Wales. I accept what the right hon. and learned Gentleman said, that he has provision in hand to increase sewerage facilities in Mid-Wales, but there are villages now that do not have a sewerage plant of any sort. In my own village, and in other villages in Ceredigion, the majority of the inhabitants do not have such facilities. I am worried, when planning applications are received by planning authorities, that they are automatically turned down—and rightly so—because of these inadequacies.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will look at this and look also at the schemes already in hand by local authorities in Mid-Wales. I hope that he will give them every encouragement. I have every faith in all the local authorities, and I am sure that all they need is encouragement and finance to carry out their work.<br><br>
I hope that, within the next three or four years, we shall be able to see the Secretary of State's programme being carried out so that we can keep our young people in Mid-Wales. We have a structural problem, too. We have small settlements and small villages, and, unless planning permission is given in these small settlements, we shall not have our schools, our small local shops, our places of worship. It is our duty to look after them. So here is a glorious opportunity for the Secretary of State. He knows the problem. I hope that, by good Government policy, we shall save the small settlements of which we are so proud, and also help the Welsh language to survive.</span></p>
<p>12.24 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kinnock</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The whole Committee will be grateful for a speech which was modest in both content and length from the hon. Member for Cardigan (Mr. Howells). He serves as a useful example to us all, not least to me. I have learned that humility is considered one of the most endearing attributes by other hon. Members. Brevity is the one that hon. Members cherish next, so I shall be brief.<br><br>

If I may use this as an opportunity to give a second Second Reading to the Housing Bill, there are some points I wish to make which refer more or less precisely to that Bill, which have a connotation for Wales and which deserve a thorough examination. The juxtaposition of Monday night's debate on the Second Reading of the Bill and today's debate gives us an example of a function which some of us would like to see devolve to the Welsh Grand Committee. Here is a Bill of strong importance to Wales, inside of which there are degrees of emphasis which deserve our attention. When I make my points about helping the Housing Bill—and I trust that I shall in no sense be out of order—I hope I can have as equally competent a reply from my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State as he gave to the debate on Monday night.<br><br>
What I should like to see as a consequence of this measure is a new spirit of initiative and audacity in the local council. I recall that the Conservative Government were elected partly on a manifesto of restoring democracy and decision-making to local authorities. They subsequently took away what vestige of decision-making local authorities had, either through the Local Government Act, or, more importantly, through the Housing Finance Act. We now see a procedure whereby a great deal more authority and incentive is being given to local authorities to take direct action in the area which must be of greatest concern to local representatives.<br><br>
I leave my surgeries, as possibly do all hon. Members, emotionally drained by the experience of seeing constituent after constituent, of all ages and from all backgrounds, facing up to the apparently intractable problem of finding a home. I shall only declare a victory over the housing problem in Wales or anywhere else when my surgeries are empty of those people, whether they are elderly couples who now occupy housing that is completely decayed, with all the attendant health and comfort problems; or elderly single persons who are embarrassed by the fact that they occupy houses which are too large for them to manage and seek specialist accommodation; or young couples who know that their marriage is jeopardised by the fact that they have to live as what my right hon. and learned Friend called " front-room families ", and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 42</span>
that their relationship with their families, which has hitherto been warm and intimate, is also jeopardised by the fact that they have to depend on mum and dad or an aunt and uncle to give them a place to live.<br><br>
The answer to the problem is a combination of a strong and dedicated central organisation which will provide the finance, initiative and discipline on local authorities so that they can take advantage of the lead given by national central government to use their powers audaciously, adventurously and in a way which is relevant to local needs. This Bill is a challenge to the Department that has control as a consequence of it. It is a challenge to the Exchequer, and to the political parties which seek to expand what my hon. Friend the Member for Newport (Mr. Hughes) has called an elementary need for housing. It is also a challenge to the local authorities in that the effect of this new housing proposal will stand or fall by the way in which they use their powers. No one will be more zealous than I in seeing that their attention is drawn to all the advantages in the legislation and criticising them if they do not take full advantage of that legislation.<br><br>
I think Members of Parliament must now move from being simply the scourge of the Front Benches of Parliament to being the scourge of the committees of the local authority. In many respects, including the case of my own local authority in Yslwyn which I share with my hon. Friend the Member for Abertillery (Mr. Thomas), it is possible that we shall not have to be as critical or as scourging as might otherwise be the case. However, if we start with the attitude that here is an opportunity to overcome the problems of housing in Wales, in a measure which at least lights the fuse for an explosion of housing construction, housing improvement and housing allocation in Wales, we shall fit into the procedure for making adequate provision in a way that Members of Parliament possibly have never been able to do before.<br><br>
I want every local authority, in response to a circular from the Department of the Environment and the Welsh Office, to establish a register of approved builders and approved architects, especially in relation to housing improvement
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0362">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 43</span>
grants in whatever area they are allocated. Where people are receiving a 50 per cent. grant, a 75 per cent. grant, a 90 per cent. grant, receiving £100 for a wash basin or £1,500 for a major renovation of property, they should have the benefit of assistance from the local authority which is knowledgeable about local conditions in the building industry and knows the best builders who are good at their trade and honest in the conduct of their trade. It should be able to give a seal of approval to builders who, by dint of their honesty, good organisation and administration, deserve to have a larger share of the local housing improvement and construction market.<br><br>
I say that without any vested interest. I have not become the Parliamentary representative of the Master Builders' Federation. However, there are builders, in my own locality, who are honest men and highly motivated. When they foresaw the end of the improvement system on 23rd June, without any particular motivation of self-interest but because they were embarrased by having to tell people that there was no hope of completing the work, and feeling for these people who are friends and neighbours of theirs, they wrote to me to ask if there was any possibility of extending the system. Naturally, their trade would be expanded. However, I do not think that that was the primary or even one of the most important reasons for their getting in touch with me<br><br>
Those builders deserve to receive the approval and even the sponsorship of local authorities, and if local authorities were required to compile such lists it would encourage a higher standard of both work and honesty in the building trade, which is sorely afflicted by what my hon. Friend has called the "cowboys". I think we all know what he means by that. It would also provide a useful guide. The local authority is the only organisation or institution that could provide such a guide for people who seek information and advice when contemplating undertaking improvements on their homes. It is a bewildering experience, as I can say from my own knowledge. I am a Member of Parliament, a graduate, somebody who prides himself on the fact that he is <i>au fait</i> with administrative pro-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 44</span>
cedures, and I was dazzled by the form filling, the procedures, the inspections, the submissions of estimates and the canvassing for a builder. It is a bewildering and very trying experience, even for people with qualifications such as members of this Committee. For older people and for people who are not used to dealing with bureaucracy or businessmen, it must be a frustrating and depressing experience. One way to remove that is to give local authorities the power to compile such registers.<br><br>
If local authorities are to take full advantage of the Housing Bill they should form housing action units. That might seem to some people to be an unnecessary extra wedge of bureaucracy. We have seen enough job creation in the process of local government reorganisation to satisfy us for a century. However, if we are to use the powers in the Housing Bill properly, if they are to be relevant to local housing and environmental needs and the whole job of providing grants is to be done in an efficient and humane manner, in a way that can be comprehended by people who want to change their homes and environment, they should have at their disposal a specialist unit which has drawn together the opinion, expertise and authority from all disparate departments of local councils into one comprehensive unit. It is a unit which should be dedicated to nothing else but ensuring that in the fullest possible sense the Housing Bill is fully implemented in that area. It will do away with a great deal of frustration and many of the hold-ups, and bring the whole force of local expertise to bear on this bewildering problem.<br><br>
In order to assist with this problem of comprehension, locally produced comprehensive pamphlets which, step by step, list the way by which people improve their homes would be of immense advantage. There is an enormous amount of misconception, rumour and mythology attached to the way in which people manage to secure grants, and the reason for their having them.<br><br>
Some people imagine that they can get grants for decorating their homes. Others imagine that they can only get grants for the most elementary hygienic improvements. A comprehensive pamphlet, liberally distributed, would change these
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0363">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 45</span>
attitudes. It would also show that when an Act of this type was introduced, it was meant for all people to take advantage of, and not simply for those who are most knowledgeable.<br><br>
I was glad to note that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment—indeed, many speakers in last Monday's debate—referred to the need for local authorities to be more active in their use of default powers. In most constituencies, but certainly in the valley constituencies of Wales, absentee landlordism is experienced on a grand scale, which results in the most dreadful deprivations for private tenants. The only way to discipline these landlords is to show that the local authority is prepared, even vengefully, to use its powers to ensure that repairs and general improvements are undertaken, and that tenants who have in some cases paid as much as 60 years of regular rent and have never defaulted, even through the strikes, the depression and the difficulties of living on an old-age pension, have every right to decent, hygienic, housing.<br><br>
These are the powers which I should like to see the Government take under the Act to encourage a more energetic use of these powers at local level.<br><br>
Another point arose during the course of the debate which, I think, will be of increasing concern to all hon. Members. I have recently written to my right hon. and learned Friend on this matter. On a modern housing estate in my constituency there is the prospect of the local authority using the provisions of the Bill to purchase a number of recently built three-bedroom semi-detached dwellings. Some of the local residents fear this development, not, as they have said, that they "have anything against council tenants " but because of the effect that such a development might have on the possibility of the sale of their own houses. They advance the argument that it would be mutually beneficial, in terms of resolving the local housing problem and maintaining the value of surrounding houses, if, instead of purchasing the newly-built houses, the local authority were to advance mortgages to people seeking to buy.<br><br>
That is not a bad idea. I have difficulty, however, in appreciating why it should still be the local authority, acting
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 46</span>
as a public lending institution, which should have to make up the deficiencies created by the private lending institutions.<br><br>
One reason for the crazy price inflation of houses has been the cavalier fashion in which the mortgage companies have treated the supply of money to would-be buyers. Another reason is that they use an archaic criterion for maintaining their cash flow and reserves, which means that the mortgage rate is held at the synthetic, stupid and prohibitive level for ordinary people to borrow. It is unfortunate that an appeal should come forward for public authorities to bail out the mortgage companies, but this is what is happening.<br><br>
The other point is, of course, that not only would the local authorities be taking the pressure off the mortgage companies and ensuring that people could purchase their own houses. They would once again be surrendering the opportunity to municipalise the most important sector of public ownership, that is, housing, in order to encourage the expansion of private housing.<br><br>
Many of my hon. Friends take great pride in the fact that people own their own houses. I do not take pride or draw particular regret from it. It is a fact of life. But the only solution to the housing problem, the design problem, the environmental problem, the money problem, the lending problem, the incomes policy problem—and just about every other problem associated with domestic finance and housing—will be either a massive extension of municipalisation and public ownership of housing or a system of 80-year 100 per cent. mortgages similar to the system operated in Norway and Sweden, which means that we combine the best virtues of private and public housing.<br><br>
The problem will not be resolved by extending private housing or subsidising private housing or bolstering up private housing—and I think this is especially true in Wales where there is the need for mobility of labour, where there is a comparatively low domestic income level and all other kinds of inhibitions which necessitate a much more adventurous attitude towards housing policy.<br><br>
For the sake of time, and out of respect for other hon. Members, I will cut short
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0364">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 47</span>
my contribution on several other points. I hope, however, that my right hon. and hon. Friends will be fierce in their encouragement of local authority initiatives to improve upon and take advantage or the facilities which exist in their new legislation. As I said earlier, I hope that they will be stringent in the way in which they approach the business of private authority purchasing of houses built allegedly—I emphasise "allegedly" —for private sale. I hope, too, that they will see that the builders, most of whom, during the time of the tight market two years ago, when house prices were rising, completely abandoned any vestige of social conscience. They welshed on deals, and young families who were hoping to buy houses were left out in the cold as the builders gazumped them. The builders are now coming with their begging bowls to local authorities, hoping that they will buy houses built two years ago for speculative motives.<br><br>
I hope, too, that my right hon. and learned Friend will find some way of stopping what I called earlier the three-way tax trick, where businessmen get together with a builder and construct houses. One of them then goes bankrupt and his main creditors who are his partners get a tax write-off; he stays in business in their employ and the whole process starts up again. There are estates in my constituency which have allegedly changed companies on seven occasions in the last eight years. The same personalities and the same personnel are running those concerns. People wonder how we get inflation and deplorable housing standards. They wonder why our estates, instead of being a source of pride, are often scars on the rest of the environment in the valleys. This is one of the reasons, and I sincerely hope that my right hon. and hon. Friends will cure it.</span></p>
<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Edwards</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I share some of the reservations or fears that the hon. Member for Bedwellty (Mr. Kinnock) expressed about the acquisition of private houses by local authorities. I believe that some builders will be and have been tempted into a rash building programme in the hope that local authorities will bail them out. All I would say about that is that it is something we want to keep a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 48</span>
close eye on to make sure that it does not happen to any great extent.<br><br>
I am bound to say that I have a good many reservations about what the hon. Gentleman said about lists of approved builders. I envisage many drawbacks. I am not sure that members of local authorities are necessarily the best judges of honesty, and I fear that if the proposal were carried out, Members of Parliament might have to act as scourges of local authorities. Many of us feel that acting as scourges of local authorities is something we do already on these problems.<br><br>
I start by taking up the observation by my hon. Friend the Member for Flint, West (Sir A. Meyer) with which I agree. I for one am not proud of the housing record of the previous administration. I do not believe that any members of the Committee should be particularly proud of the housing record of the Governments they support.<br><br>
There is a temptation, and the Committee is not at its best when it succumbs to it, to make blanket statements about achievements or housing needs in Wales that disguise the many variations that actually exist. There is a temptation on both sides, too, to use statistics to support our own particular political point of view. I doubt whether either side gains much from that exercise. I shall return to that matter at the end of my speech, but I want just to say to the Secretary of State that I do not believe that he will produce a good base on which to solve the problems if he simply devotes a large part of his speech, as he did, to suggesting that the problems we face have all arisen in the past two or three years.<br><br>
I remind the right hon. and learned Gentleman, as he launches programmes that I hope will succeed, that the last time a Labour Government announced a crash programme in 1967 the figures for housing starts began to fall. The problems are not easy to solve and we shall not solve them if we attempt to do so on a basis of false political points.<br><br>
Reading the Second Reading speech of the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil (Mr. Rowlands) on Monday, with much of which I agreed, and that of the hon. Member for Caernarvon (Mr. Wigley), I was struck by the enormous variety of problems that we face in Wales. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0365">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 49</span>
speech of the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil, with its emphasis on the need for improvement of existing stock, went some way to justify the emphasis in that direction by the previous Government and to give some justification for the emphasis by Opposition Members on the total figures for house building and house improvement.<br><br>
In that speech, the Under-Secretary rightly explained the need for flexible application of the policies outlined in the Housing Bill. It is clear that the problems of the Rhondda, with its high proportion of owner-occupation but large stock of unimproved properties without basic facilities, are quite different from those of my own constituency of Pembroke.<br><br>
Equally, from the speech of the hon. Member for Caernarvon it is clear that the problems of second homes there are different in many ways from those in other parts of Wales. I declare an interest in the matter. Some 30 years ago, my father, a Welshman working in London, acquired a tiny sixteenth-century cottage in the Black Mountains, just inside the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth (Mr. Stradling Thomas), together with a derelict water-mill just inside the constituency of the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Roderick). Some ten years ago, largely with my own hands and those of friends, I re-roofed that water-mill, modernised and improved it, so I have a second home there.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. D. E. Thomas</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Shame.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Edwards</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think it a matter of shame that a Welshman should wish to have a second home in Wales. I must express some sadness, after spending 30 years in that valley on the Monmouth-Brecon border, that the indigenous population of the valley and its neigbouring valleys has steadily declined. But it would be false analysis to say that it had declined because outsiders had moved in. There have been great changes. There have been changes in the nature of the farming. A number of people have come to the valley working in professional jobs in neighbouring towns, even commuters from further afield, and the owners of second homes.<br><br>
I discussed the matter with the hon.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 50</span>
Member for Brecon and Radnor before the debate. He would agree that in those cases very few homes for local people have been lost by that change. What has happened is that homes, many of them in inconvenient remote positions and having fallen derelict, have been saved and given life.<br><br>
There are some sad features that local authorities could have altered for the better. I know a number of people who have lived in small houses, sometimes with totally unacceptable approaches and without basic facilities, who have moved some way from the area where they have spent most of their lives to the new housing estates on the edge of towns like A bergavenny, Crickhowell and villages such as Pandy on the edge of the area. It is a pity that local authorities have not been able to provide small pockets of housing in the centre of the area and have concentrated so much of their effort on the large housing estates near the towns.<br><br>
I believe that a greater contribution could be made. I do not believe that much can be done through the exercise of the powers that the Secretary of State says local authorities possess to acquire existing properties to let them either for holiday lets or on a long-term basis. I am fairly certain that there are parts of Merioneth and Caernarvon and North Wales where it is the right solution. There are certainly a few—though very few—villages in my own constituency in Pembroke where it would be a helpful solution.<br><br>
I hope that where they think that this action would be helpful and they have the powers, the local authorities will exercise them. That is a proper approach to the problem. I certainly prefer it to the implication I thought contained in the speech of the hon. Member for Caernarvon that we should seek to exercise stern control over people coming into the area. That would be a regrettable step in many ways.<br><br>
In Pembrokeshire the problem is rather different. There we have a rising population. We have had a large amount of private house building in recent years. During my election campaign, I visited all the new housing estates and I was struck by the extraordinary extent of the building that has taken place in the past
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1974-1974V005P0I0366">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 51</span>
year or two. It is only when one goes from one estate to another, down all the roads on those estates, that one realises how they have grown, almost overnight.<br><br>
A great deal of private building has taken place. Prices have not been pushed up in this area so much by the demand for second homes as by the fact that people are coming to the area to settle, to retire or to work in the standing industries such as the oil refineries and in the re-activated base at Broady.<br><br>
Our problem is a lack of rented accommodation for young families. It arises mainly not because of the existence of second homes, but because the homes that we have in the villages, whether owned by locals or those from further afield, tend to be let in the summer on short lets. Tourism is, of course, one of our major industries. It makes a valuable contribution to the local economy.<br><br>
Therefore, there is a need, particularly in my constituency, for the local authority to step in and fill that gap. I do not see it being met by anyone else. There is certainly a need in my constituency for the construction of local authority houses. In the past, I have been a scourge of some of my local authorities for what I regard as the sad failure of their house building programmes. The new Preseli council has inherited a waiting list of approximately 2,000.<br><br>
I listened with interest to the reasons given by the Secretary of State for the failure of local authorities to build. That is the central question that I want to ask. I do not agree that it can all be put down to inflexibility of the housing cost yardstick or the introduction of the Housing Finance Act, although I think that many local authorities misjudged the situation when they thought that they had solved the problem.<br><br>
I should have thought that we could establish that it was not due to those two causes from the fact that there was a great upsurge in the last half of 1973, as mentioned by the right and learned Gentleman. But all my local authorities have told me that the housing cost yardstick has not been the major problem in our area. That is an almost unanimous
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 52</span>
view. When the previous Minister of State offered to meet them to discuss the housing cost yardstick, none of the authorities took up the invitation. In our area all authorities agree that it is a lack of builders, contractors and of materials that has been our major problem.<br><br>
That is why we must study each area with its own particular problem. We must decide the best way of solving the problem in each area, not on a blanket all-Wales basis, but on the basis of the needs and problems of each area. It is not enough to say that we shall build more houses. We have to analyse the situation. We must analyse carefully the reasons for the reduction for a decade in local authority house building starts. There has been a reduction in the number of local authority housing starts in Wales in every year since 1964, and in completions since 1967.<br><br>
The Secretary of State's analysis was superficial, and in some aspects was simply not borne out by the facts. The danger is that if we on either side of the Committee base our policies on that kind of false analysis, namely, that we are dealing with a two-year or three-year problem that was the fault of the previous Government and not the fault of something much more deep-seated and longstanding, we shall reach the wrong decisions and the people of Wales will suffer. The whole of the right hon. and learned Gentleman's speech was based on that assumption.<br><br>
Only right at the end did I find a moment for hope, when the Secretary of State suggested that we should base our policies on a grass-roots analysis of needs. If the right hon. and learned Gentleman tears up the rest of his speech and concentrates on that aspect, I believe that there is some prospect of achieving the targets that I know we all wish to achieve.</span></p>
