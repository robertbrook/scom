	<section>
	<div class='legislation'>Government's Legislative Programme</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed [this day],</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Government's legislative programme as outlined in the Queen's Speech as it relates to Wales and public expenditure in Wales.—[	<i>Mr. Hain</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>2 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Hywel Francis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberavon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --> (Lab)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I spoke earlier of the need for a carers' revolution, and that possibility has been hastened by the Queen's Speech, with its 10-year child care strategy and by the announcement today of the possibility of an older people's commissioner for Wales. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Ian Lucas), who is not in his place, for his sterling, pioneering work over the past year to promote the possibility of such a commissioner through his private Member's Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Queen's Speech brought to the fore the key policy question of the work-life balance. It is crucial that policy development on that is broadened so that we can provide care for all generations. Granny care will be as important as child care in future if we are to achieve fairness and greater economic activity. With that in mind, I am sure that all hon. Members will support the launch of an all-party parliamentary carers group in January to monitor progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, a sustainable carers' revolution can be achieved only if we build on the strong and democratic partnership between Westminster and Wales. Under a Labour Government, the Queen's Speech has once again made great progress in that direction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>2.2 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Wiggin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leominster) (Con)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was amusing this morning to hear the Secretary of State making up Conservative policy, but I am happy to confirm that there are no plans to cut the Welsh block grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the Assembly was created, there have been only three Wales-specific Bills. In the same time, it has debated nearly 20 measures with the potential to be dealt with by Bills from Westminster. None the less, I have reservations about the practicality of the proposals outlined in the Queen's Speech. The draft Transport (Wales) Bill leaves many questions unanswered after the move to abolish the Strategic Rail Authority, which is the cornerstone of the draft Bill. The Government's latest response to Committee suggestions on the Bill avoids answering several questions by saying that a memorandum of understanding between the Assembly and the Department for Transport will answer them. However, those questions are important; indeed, they are integral to proper understanding and scrutiny of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
For example, we do not know what the relationship will be between Network Rail and the Assembly or what power the Assembly will have over English rail policies that adversely affect Wales. We do not know what the governing relationship over franchise functions will be, what the position of a transport commissioner in Wales will be, or what will be done if there is an unsolvable dispute over local transport plans between local authorities and the Assembly. Nor do we know, of course, the financial implications for the Assembly and the people of Wales. The provision to grant the Assembly a power of financial assistance for air transport, for example, comes with no extra funding, so support would have to be found from within the Assembly's budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, the people of Wales, like the people in the rest of Britain, are no strangers to tax increases and extra costs. They know that the Treasury has failed to meet its targets on tax, income and spending, leaving a widening gap in the public accounts. They also know that the Government have increased taxes 66 times and that their council tax has increased substantially. The Labour election strategy to try to reduce council tax bills in Wales will not fool many, and I have reservations about how far £40 million will go when it is spread across the whole country. It will come to about £7 each, which is a poor return for the average 79 per cent. increase in council tax that Welsh residents have seen since 1997.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Labour promises of more funding for councils prove to be all talk, Wales could, once again, see great rises in council tax. Even with extra funding to reduce bills, council costs are rising faster than central funding because of new regulations, burdens and laws imposed from Whitehall. Taxes will have to rise or services will have to be cut. Of course, the people of Wales know that the Queen's Speech will hit them in the wallet, but the question is whether they will get value for money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Economic inactivity has increased at a higher rate in Wales than in the rest of the United Kingdom: Welsh economic activity currently stands at 74.7 per cent., which is well behind the UK average of 78.4 per cent. The proportion of people of working age in Wales who were in employment in March 2004 was 71.2 per cent. Once again, Wales lags behind the UK average of 74.7 per cent. The statistics come from the Assembly's Stat Wales website. Wales has lost 26,000 manufacturing jobs since 1997, 700 agricultural jobs during the past year, and 44,000 private-sector jobs since 1999; yet there has been an 80 per cent, increase in the cost of bureaucrats employed by the Assembly. However, I note a complete lack of legislation to do anything about the excessive regulation, bureaucracy and heavy taxes faced by businesses and individuals in Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --> (LD)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having agreed with the hon. Gentleman about the problems with the council tax, I am waiting to hear the Conservative party's solution. I respectfully ask him to answer the question on all our lips. What is the Conservative party's alternative to the problems caused in Wales by the council tax?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2004-2005V004P0I0249">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My feeling, and that of all council tax payers, is that the problem is simply the amount that people are being asked to pay. It is a Government stealth tax; it allows less Government spending. In return, councils have to levy a higher council tax, and the Government watch as local councillors take the blame. That seems to be the Government's strategy. The problems with the council tax became acute when council tax rises became so intense that people began to hurt, and that has continued over the last few years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not necessary to have a local income tax—the hon. Gentleman would like me to say that it is—because it would not really help. In my constituency, it would cost the average family an extra £500. It would be a great mistake. The problem is the amount of money that the Government are not giving to our councils, not the way in which local people have to pay. The hon. Gentleman is twitching to intervene.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not seek to persuade the hon. Gentleman of the benefits of a local income tax; I leave it to voters to decide whether they prefer that or the council tax. My question remains, though. The hon. Gentleman seems to suggest that the Conservative party will provide more money for councils, thereby reducing the council tax. If my understanding is right, that is exactly the promise that he makes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was making no promises. I was talking about the Queen's Speech. I am certainly not going to make any spending commitments here and now, no matter how tempting it may seem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Albert Owen 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ynys Môn) (Lab)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman referred to the increase in council tax bills throughout Wales. Is he aware that in 2000 the Labour-led Assembly Government changed the formula of the standard spending assessment from that introduced by the Wales Office under the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood). Would the hon. Gentleman revert to the old formula? As a consequence of the change made in 2000, Ynys Môn county council gets an extra £7 million per annum, thereby helping to reduce the burden that the local council has to impose on local council tax payers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that the more money local authorities receive from central Government, the less they have to levy on local people. I do not have a problem with that concept. However, I have a problem with the reality. We hear a lot about increased spending, but our council tax bills seem always to increase. That happens because a great deal of the money that the Government give to local authorities is ring-fenced. It is therefore difficult for councils to show local flexibility. I think that the hon. Gentleman would agree with that, as he often talks of devolution, but let us devolve all the way down to the local authorities, to where the spending happens. To answer the question, we should be spending at the most local level. I think that he would agree that that would be the most effective way to spend local money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of the last Conservative Government, Welsh GDP was 82.2 per cent, of the UK average. It should have been an ever-increasing percentage, but by last year it had shrunk to just 78.9 per cent, of the UK average. For all the Chancellor's assertions of
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
economic growth in the UK, Wales is sliding further and further behind. Sadly, I see no proposals in this Gracious Speech that will do anything to remedy that situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government seem simply to be skimming over the fact that the prosperity gap between Wales and the rest of the UK continues to grow. Perhaps the avoidance of certain areas of policy is more significant than the legislation that the Government have chosen to include. Welsh new-build affordable housing has been cut by 78 per cent. since Labour took control of the Assembly, the back-log of urgent Welsh housing repairs has risen to £4.1 billion, and 98,000 Welsh homes are unfit for human habitation. At the same time, council tax is rising fast. Unfortunately, so is homelessness. Since 1997, the number of homeless Welsh people has risen by 112 per cent. from 4,297 to 9,147 yet there are no moves in the next Session's legislation to tackle the increasing Welsh housing crisis. The Chancellor promised in his pre-Budget report to provide support for first-time buyers, yet even with future social housing grants projected to 2008, affordable housing budgets in Wales will still be below their 1997 levels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, the Government's proposals on education leave much to be desired, and many vital issues affecting Welsh students remain unchallenged. The continuing consequence of the Higher Education Bill is still extremely relevant for Welsh students. Top-up fees are postponed, but the Assembly's floundering on the issue means that students cannot plan for the debts that lie ahead. The Chancellor's pre-Budget report spoke of removing the remaining barriers for teenagers, so that every young person could stay in education. He should try telling that to the 2,000 students who marched through Cardiff last Thursday, campaigning against top-up fees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Top-up fees are as big an issue as ever, but the Government have gone eerily quiet over the higher education spending deficits. The six Welsh pilot areas affected by the School Transport Bill will prove whether charges for school transport have a detrimental effect on children. Development on the issue must not mean an unfair deal for children living far from schools in rural areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Huw Edwards 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Monmouth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --> (Lab)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman was a member of the Committee that considered the School Transport Bill, will he acknowledge that no charges need to be introduced if none of the pilot authorities chooses not to do so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman know whether they will choose not to do so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edwards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not yet know where the pilot areas are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that that solves that problem.

As I said, developments on this issue must not mean an unfair deal for children in rural areas. Unfortunately, until we see the results of the rural area pilot schemes, we will not be able to answer the hon. Gentleman's question definitely. As he also sat on the Committee that considered the Bill, I would hope that he would know, but obviously my intention is that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2004-2005V004P0I0250">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
authorities do not charge for transport. I hope that that answers his question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I welcome the intentions of the education Bill to give schools greater freedom and to raise standards, one of the biggest issues of discipline has gone unnoticed again. Wales is increasingly missing its targets for tackling absenteeism, and truancy is increasing. Teachers complain that expelled children are being forced back into the same schools, yet the Queen's Speech and the expenditure proposals have provided nothing to tackle Wales's inability to provide for children whose behaviour has got out of control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Health care may still be the biggest problem. There are no measures in the Queen's Speech to improve health care, despite its obviously dire state. The Secretary of State today praised the growth in the number of nurses in Wales, but, despite my intervention, he failed to mention the 500 unfilled nursing vacancies. MRSA rates are not improving: the number of cases has more than trebled since 1996. The out-of-hours general practitioners' service in Wales is in constant and escalating turmoil. It tells mothers to take sick children 200 miles, instructs a man suffering from chest pains to travel to the fifth-nearest hospital 40 miles away, and makes people wait days for a return call or never calls them back at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State often mentions the increase in Welsh health spending since 1997, yet surely it is more telling that the Welsh health service is still failing massively, even with money being thrown at it. Some 311,765 people now await hospital treatment, and out-patients' waits are at an all-time high of 240, 167—a 5 per cent, increase on last year. Even when patients finally receive treatment, Wales lags further and further behind other developed countries in its access to medical technology. The use of less invasive treatment to tackle blockages in the heart arteries is half that in England, yet Wales has a higher rate of heart disease.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is abundantly clear that health care in Wales needs to be tackled urgently, yet the Government's legislative programme contains no measures to improve the health service in Wales. The pre-Budget report almost entirely ignored the subject, except to mention the savings in drug procurement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, Wales will also be affected by many of the Government's plans for nationwide legislation. Sadly, those plans are aimed more towards crowding out any space for the Opposition on the security agenda, as the Secretary of State for Wales has freely admitted, than at making real improvements to the lives of people in Britain and Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Betty Williams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Conwy) (Lab)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon.

my criticism is for Labour delivery of health care in Wales. I criticise not doctors or nurses, but on the basis of the results and the increase in bureaucracy I am sure you would agree, Mr. Griffiths, that the Labour Administration in the Assembly has nothing to be proud of about health care. What the hon. Lady says about doctors and nurses is of course right, but why does her party's Government not trust those professionals more, instead of setting them targets? Let them get on with the job that they are trained to do, and I am sure that the results will be even better. I doubt whether they could be any worse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon.

The record in Wales, as well as in the rest of the UK, is pretty good.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not up to me to choose statistics but up to the voters to decide whether health care delivery in Wales is good enough. I have not yet heard anyone singing its praises, but I am sure that the hon. Lady has a very different view. I am happy to discuss the health service in Wales at any time, but I want to return to my speech, because we are of course discussing the effect on Wales of the Government's plans for nationwide legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was about to discuss something that will affect the hon. Lady's constituency—the unnecessary amalgamation of the historic Royal Regiment of Wales and Royal Welch Fusiliers. It is a real tragedy, and I cannot understand why the Government want to cut our armed forces when they are so deeply overstretched. It is real folly to lose two of the most historic regiments, which have unparalleled histories.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Albert Owen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman began his remarks by saying that he would not touch the Welsh block at all—it would remain the same over the period outlined by the Chancellor. He also now says that we should not cut defence. Where would the £35 billion of cuts be made?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The only person who has mentioned £35 billion of cuts is the Secretary of State, with his little helper echoing—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members should read the shadow Chancellor's speech. Perhaps I can help the hon. Gentleman; huge savings are available. Even the Government have recognised that. I think that it was in Gershon's recommendations that the figure was given of at least £20 billion being wasted by the Government at the moment. I do not think that it is beyond rhyme or reason, or the wit of my party, to find another £15 billion on top of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How much?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot confirm exactly how much we can cut, but I can confirm that we want to cut waste. I am sure that all parties share that goal. We also want to ensure that we provide better value for taxpayers' money.

I shall not go through our spending plans while we are discussing the Queen's Speech, but if people are

The Government deliver for people of all ages—from a £65 increase for child tax credit, to increases of £4.25 for a single person's pension and £3.95 for a couple, and an extra £50 for pensioners over 70. Fighting poverty from childhood to old age is a record of which the Labour Government can be proud. While the Opposition parties talk Wales down, the Labour Government build it up with a strong economy, and security and opportunity for all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire opened for the Opposition parties and welcomed the Bills on transport and the ombudsman, but soon lost the plot. He also seemed to lose his memory: he was concerned about council tax, and was particularly critical about rebanding, but that policy was agreed when his party were in partnership with the Labour party in Cardiff before the last Assembly election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman complained about council tax, but was characteristically vague about how the Liberal Democrats' local income tax would work. In answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central (Mr. Jones), he described his system as simple, but after listening to his explanation, I think that the only thing that is simple is the person who devised the policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret the fact that the Minister has to resort to personal attacks. Surely he will accept that the Liberal Democrats have made a serious proposition of an alternative method, which is different from the council tax, called local income tax. It works in other countries and is simpler than the council tax. Would he not at least accept that, although he may disagree with our proposal, it is for the voters to decide which they prefer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I never for one moment suggested that the hon. Gentleman was simple; I have too much regard for him to think that he had a hand in the daft policy that his party is putting forward. He failed to explain how the Inland Revenue, whose database for income tax is built around where people work, will adjust its IT system to cope with a local income tax based on residence. There are 500,000 people who are not covered by pay-as-you-earn and do not pay tax. One assumes that, if the Liberal Democrats had their way and we had a local income tax, they would also not pay that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman then had the cheek to go on about the failure of Government IT systems. That comes from a party that, in Wales, is so IT illiterate it e-mailed its manifestos to Labour Members of the National Assembly and not to Liberal Democrat Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is straying a little from local taxation. Would he not agree that the Inland Revenue knows where people live as well as where they work? We had a thoughtful contribution from one of his hon. Friends, who said that council tax had just about run its day. Will the Labour Government continue with their support for council tax, or will they look at fairer methods of raising local taxation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is patient, I will come to that in a moment. I have remarks to make about other contributions first.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire moved from one fantasy to another. He explained that his party wishes to abolish the Department of Trade and Industry, but that it does not want to abolish the spending. What is the point of abolishing the Department if it is going to leave the spending? I am sure that the 90,000 miners, miners' widows and families in Wales who have made claims under the mineworkers compensation scheme will wonder where their compensation will come from when the Liberal Democrats, if they get their way, abolish the DTI.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman ended up with the usual Lib Dem wish list of massive increases in public expenditure on everything from ending variable tuition fees to free care for the elderly, all probably uncosted but providing a convenient bandwagon for the Liberals to jump on to gain publicity without responsibility. If jumping on a bandwagon were a criminal offence, the Liberal party would be serial offenders and would be in deep trouble.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have always said that one cannot get good public services without public expenditure. For that reason, we supported the Government when they proposed increases in national insurance for employees and employers. We are now being honest in saying that any improvement in public expenditure that we propose will be paid for by increasing the marginal rate of taxation for those people who earn more than £100,000 of taxable income. We think that we are being fair, honest and transparent, but I do not believe that the Minister is reflecting that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's figures do not stack up. That has been shown in the comments made by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State this morning and on other occasions. Most of the Liberal Democrats' programme appears to be uncosted. I have said about the Liberal Democrats time and again that it is a matter of publicity without responsibility. They will not be in government. Those of us who campaign with the Liberal Democrats in Wales all know that they are like the 50p piece—seven sides and two faces.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North welcomed Bills in the Queen's Speech, in particular the news that there will be a draft Bill for an older people's commissioner. She went on to mention jobs in the civil service in her constituency, and I can tell her that 84 jobs have moved into the constituency. As a result of changes that the Government have made in the past few years, 400 jobs have come to Swansea with the Pension Service, and 600 jobs will come to Newport with the transfer of the Office for National Statistics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend has a reputation as a powerful campaigner for child care and the rights of the family. Because she is a respected authority on those matters, we paid particular attention today to her comments on the Government's child care plans. She made it clear that, in her view, the Government are making a real difference. She welcomed the 10 per cent, increase in the child care element of the tax credit, the child trust
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2004-2005V004P0I0252">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>69</span>
fund and the improved paternity and maternity rights for fathers and mothers. She said that in her constituency there is much hope and optimism for the future. I believe that she speaks for the overwhelming majority of her constituents and for the people of Wales. Whenever the general election comes, I have no doubt that that will be reflected in the result in Cardiff, North.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy welcomed the announcement made by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State on the older people's commissioner, and I thank him for that. However, he went on to complain that there was nothing in the Queen's Speech about the National Assembly for Wales' Housing (Suspension of the Right to Buy) (Wales) Bill. I reiterate that the Assembly proposal is to be considered in the Session 2005–06. I confirm that the Bills to come before Parliament in this Session are those priority Bills passed on to us by the First Minister, representing the Assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman seemed to support the Liberal Democrats' proposals for a local income tax. In response to him and to the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire, I can say that Sir Michael Lyons is conducting an inquiry into local government funding in England. I confirm that my colleague Sue Essex, the Assembly Minister for Finance, Local Government and Public Services, has been in touch with Sir Michael Lyons, as have I, because the outcome of his report will feed across into Wales. I believe that he will be taking evidence in Wales, which is important. The Government are committed to reflecting upon the way in which local government is funded, but we are not rushing headlong into a daft scheme of the sort proposed by the Liberal Democrats.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister confirm that if that report recommends a local income tax, the Government will consider it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall wait to see the outcome of the report. I would not want to anticipate it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy also spoke about under-age drinking and alcohol abuse, and I share his concern. The drinks industry needs to do more to combat excessive drinking and to persuade more people to drink more moderately. I secured an Adjournment debate when I was a Back Bencher, following which I received a nasty letter from a leading executive of a drinks company. I had criticised the company because it was doing market research on alcohol-based milk shakes. Who drinks milk shakes? Children do, and that company was targeting children for its future business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman went on to comment on the drugs problem that blights society throughout the United Kingdom. I share his view that we should have an extensive intervention programme, and I can tell him that my colleague the Assembly Minister for Social Justice and Regeneration is initiating a number of financial schemes in order that Wales can have a more extensive intervention system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
I would not attribute the following comments to the hon. Gentleman, but he might want to pass on the view to his colleagues in Cardiff. The Assembly's nationalist spokesperson on social affairs has called for the full decriminalisation of cannabis as a first step towards ending the long-lost war on drugs. Indeed, in an article in Triban Coch earlier this year, she called for cannabis cafés in Cardiff as a potential way of boosting the tourist trade there. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman does not share that view, but it would not be a bad idea if he were to let his colleagues in the Assembly know of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman went on in some detail to speak about the many Home Office Bills in the Queen's Speech. They are all important Bills in fighting crime and combating drug misuse, and there is the proposal for youth justice legislation, which he welcomed. However, like the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire, the hon. Gentleman complained a great deal about the Government's proposals for ID cards. In particular, he thought that it would be an infringement of civil rights to require people to carry an ID card. Surely, we would all agree that the greatest right is the right to life. All of us, as citizens, should expect the Government to take steps to protect us from crime and the threat of terrorism. People who have nothing to hide have nothing to fear from ID cards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman went on to speak about experiences in other countries, where, he said, ethnic groups felt that they were being stopped unnecessarily by the police. We do not have ID cards in this country but there is plenty of evidence that that has happened here. I recognise that what the hon. Gentleman described can happen, but surely it is important that we tackle that as an abuse in the system, rather than saying that we would not consider ID cards because they involve problems when people are stopped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have ID cards to gain access to the Palace of Westminster, as I said to the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire this morning. Like, perhaps, many other right hon. and hon. Members, I have been stopped by the police and asked for my identity. Is not it simple just to show my card and show that I have the right of access? Imagine not having ID cards to come in here and being stopped by a police officer, impeding our right to come here as the House allows us to while investigations were carried out to prove who we are. The argument is weak. I hope that as the Bill passes through Parliament the hon. Gentleman will—although I am not too hopeful about him—reflect on the importance and value of the measure, and not take it to be such an infringement of civil rights as he now considers it to be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister not recognise that there is all the difference in the world in being able to show who one is and what one intends to do? Given that transponder technology now means that it would be possible electronically to tag everyone and really know what they were up to, if the Government felt that that was feasible and affordable would they recommend it—or do they accept that there is a line beyond which one should not pass, in which case we are simply drawing it in a different place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2004-2005V004P0I0253">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>71</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the hon. Gentleman is seriously putting that forward as a proposal. If so, that is an even more batty Liberal Democrat policy than we have heard before. This is a serious debate. I recognise that people have concerns about the use of identity cards but I think that most people in this country believe that if one has nothing to hide, one has no problem with and no fear of carrying an identity card. We have been carrying them in this place for some years and I do not think that anyone here has objected to their use. It has certainly been an easy way to pave our access into the Palace of Westminster. For the life of me I cannot see how that argument is carried forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Adam Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all remember the miners strike, do we not, when police forces were trying to prevent pickets from moving across the country. Can the Minister not envisage some possible future scenario when there would be an abuse, because the police would want to track the movement of trade union activists or other political activists? Once they had the name they would check with the database and be able to use their resources, the resources of the state, to prevent legitimate expression of political activity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have civil rights legislation that protects us from that kind of abuse. I can only say to the hon. Gentleman that he makes a fair point, because we have had bad experiences in the past when another party was in power, but we must look at the experiences of countries in mainland Europe. They do not have the kind of problems that the hon. Gentleman has suggested. It is important to have a full and thorough debate on the matter. In the end the Government will, I believe, convince people that the step is the right one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Aberavon spoke about the older people's commissioner and welcomed the proposals. He also spoke about his work on the Carers (Equal Opportunities) Act 2004, which he put through the House of Commons and for which we are grateful. He called for a carers' revolution and he is right. Everyone in the Chamber now recognises from visits to their surgery week after week that there are people who spend their life caring for others and that often they are vulnerable and in need of support, backing and encouragement. The proposals that we will eventually bring forward for the older people's commissioner will provide a champion for older people's rights and that will, I think, be greatly welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Leominster gave his usual set piece speech, but I was more intrigued by the intervention on my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State this morning. If I understood it correctly, the £35 billion of cuts proposed by the shadow Chancellor will not apply in Wales. Indeed, when he came back into the Room at two o'clock he confirmed that there would be no cuts to the Welsh block.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wiggin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right. It is therefore the Opposition's proposal to cut public expenditure by £35 billion, which would be paid for by the people of England, Ireland and Scotland, but Wales will make
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
no contribution whatever to it. Indeed, the hon. Gentleman assured us that the people of Wales will have increased spending. I think, Mr. Griffiths, that Christmas has come early; Santa Wiggin has certainly delivered his message to everybody in Wales. I really cannot believe that that is the Opposition's policy. It certainly does not stack up with proposals that the shadow Chancellor has talked about. Indeed, the much-discussed James review of public expenditure by the Conservative party identifies savings in education of £5.6 billion and in health of £7.2 billion. There are consequences of that in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the hon. Gentleman saying that the fact that Wales has benefited from that kind of expenditure means that it will not be clawed back? It would be Utopia if the Conservatives were to deliver on that. I think that, before too long, the hon. Gentleman will receive a telephone call from the shadow Chancellor with an invitation to have a cup of tea in the Pugin Room, and have the facts of life, so far as these measures are concerned, explained to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister will confirm my understanding that the hon. Member for Leominster said that the Conservatives would match the Government's expenditure on health and education as well?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. He said that they are committed to matching the Government's commitments on health and education. All that will come as something of a surprise to the Conservatives, not just to the shadow Chancellor but to the Conservative leader in the Assembly, who told the 	<i>The Western Mail</i> how £1 billion of cuts would be implemented in Wales. Clearly, there is a problem of communication between Cardiff and London so far as that is concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Leominster also went on to assure us that the Conservative party is committed to cutting taxes. Again, the shadow Chancellor will be a bit surprised because, in an interview with 	<i>The Daily Telegraph</i> on 9 December 2003, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We won't go to the polls at the next election saying that we'll reduce the tax bill. If we do that, Gordon Brown will just accuse of slashing and burning public services."</p></blockquote>
So, the shadow Chancellor does not know that the hon. Gentleman has committed the Conservatives to tax cuts at the next election. He wound up by comparing Wales before 1997 and Wales now. I do not think that there is a better comparison of Wales in 1997 and Wales now than in the remarks of the right hon. Member for Wokingham. Speaking about the Tory years, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"15 per cent interest rates, sky high mortgage arrears, negative equity, bankruptcies, entrepreneurs giving up the ghost on private-run companies and a lot of people losing their jobs."</p></blockquote>
He went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I don't think there was a family in the country that didn't experience at least one of those anguishes. My parents lost their jobs in that recession. A lot of people lost their houses."</p></blockquote>
That was the Tory record in Government, and whatever the hon. Gentleman says, that will not be forgotten by the people of Wales when we come to the next election. That is not the case in the prosperous, vigorous Wales of today.

	<span class='label label-info column'>73</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ynys Môn welcomed the Queen's Speech and the pre-Budget report. In particular, he mentioned the Consumer Credit Bill. I know that he has done a great deal of work on Ynys Môn promoting the information in that Bill among his constituents. He talked about business confidence on Ynys Môn, and I certainly believe that is the case, as when I was last in that constituency I found that that was moving forward and he confirmed that today. He talked about building on the transport and broadband infrastructure and of the investment that his island is receiving, and how important those will be to its future. He also spoke about the importance of the Wales (Transport) Bill, and touched on the Railways Bill, asking whether there will be a Welsh representative on the Railways Bill. I can confirm that the National Assembly will have the opportunity to nominate representatives of the passenger consultative committee on that. He also talked about the improved transport links, particularly the air links, that we hope will follow legislation that is to come before Parliament. If an air link between north and south Wales succeeds, it will be due in no small measure to him. If he achieves nothing else in the few years that he has served in the House of Commons, the development of that air link and the tremendous way in which he has promoted the case for it on behalf of his constituents will be to his eternal credit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for speaking at length after that intervention. I rise, as a passenger rather than an academic, to make a point about the issue of the representative on the rail users council. The point was well made, and perhaps the Minister will comment on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Touhig</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that point was well made. As I said, it will be for my colleagues in the Assembly to nominate the representative, but I have no doubt that they will take that point into account, and I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Ynys Môn will ensure that Assembly Members are also aware of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to the point made by the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire, who spent a little time at the beginning of his remarks talking about devolution and where it was going, and teasing the Government to say what our proposals are. He knows full well what they are. We plan to publish a White Paper after a general election, in which we will set out the options for the people of Wales. That is our policy. It was agreed by the party conference and that is what we will say to the people of Wales at a general election. If the people endorse us and return this Government to power, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will publish a White Paper setting out the options for the future and how devolution in Wales will progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Conwy spoke particularly about road safety and people using mobile phones while driving, which is illegal. She gave us an example and spoke about deaths on the roads, excessive speed and those who demonise speed cameras. I agree entirely. All the evidence suggests
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
that speed cameras do save lives. The sort of campaigns that we have seen in the media against them are wholly wrong. There is no doubt in my mind that they are an important tool in making our roads safer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend also spoke about the need to improve the rail service to north Wales. I have used that service, and I hope and pray that she is successful, because it does need considerable improvement. With her as a champion, I have no doubt that there will be considerable improvements in that service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth spoke about the economic stability that this Government have brought for Wales and for his constituents in particular. He spoke about many of the problems faced by farmers in his constituency. Again, in his time in this House, there has been no firmer friend and champion of the rural community than him. He has worked tirelessly to ensure that their voices are heard in this place, and he has been in constant touch to understand their needs and problems. I have no doubt whatever that they appreciate all his hard work and that that appreciation will be reflected whenever the general election is held. He will be with us on the Government Benches in Labour's third term of government.

My hon. Friend also spoke importantly about the three-for-two issue of children travelling on school buses. He made an important contribution during consideration of the School Transport Bill. I heard what he said, and I have no doubt that Ministers also heard it, so let us hope that there will be some progress on school transport.

The hon. Member for East Carmarthen and Dinefwr (Adam Price) discussed quite a range of economic issues relevant to Wales. He praised the Chancellor for his management of the economy, and he is not alone: the Chancellor has a great many admirers across the board as a result of the success with which he has managed the British economy for the past seven years. The hon. Gentleman does, however, detect a degree of insecurity about the future. I do not detect that in my constituency, but I accept the two points that he makes about pensions. There is undoubtedly a worry about pensions and about people's futures. He touched on Abingdon Carpets in my constituency, where more than 400 people who were part of the Abingdon pension scheme now find that only about a third of their pension will be paid to them as a result of a failure of the previous management to keep payments going into the scheme and to prevent the company from going out of business and the pension fund falling into considerable deficit.

It is important that legislation introduced by this Government results in opportunities to give help and support to people such as my constituents. I have written to the trustees of the Abingdon financial assistance scheme, urging them to submit an application to the Department for Work and Pensions by 10 December for the Abingdon pensions to be considered for support under the financial assistance scheme. The details of the scheme are yet to be agreed, but I hope that the proposal will give

	<span class='label label-info column'>75</span>
comfort and support to my hard-working constituents and to those across Wales who have put in a lifetime of work, only to find their pensions considerably reduced.

The hon. Gentleman talked about economic inactivity, although there is a disagreement over the trend. The Government's view is that the figure has fallen by about 2 per cent, since 1997. The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy said that economic inactivity in Neath was 31.4 per cent. Our information suggests that the figure is 29.2 per cent., but as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said in an intervention, things have been peculiar in the past year. The rate appeared to move downwards and then there was a blip.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clearly in all our interests to do everything that we can to tackle the problem of economic inactivity. The pathways to work scheme, as rolled out in Bridgend and Rhondda Cynon Taf, has seen 1,000 people moving from incapacity benefit into work. That is to be encouraged and welcomed.

All politics is about choice. The Queen's Speech and the pre-Budget report offer the people of Wales a clear choice for the future. This debate shows the gaping
	<span class='label label-info column'>76</span>
chasm between the can't dos and won't dos on the Opposition Benches and the Labour Government of can dos and will dos, who are on the side of the people. This debate has exposed the fundamental choice between the Opposition parties, talking Wales down at every opportunity and pledged to social division and economic collapse, and the Government, delivering opportunity, choice and equality for the people of Wales. We believe that the Government can and should be a force for good. That is why we offer the people of Wales an agenda based on opportunity, social justice and security for all. That is why I believe that the people of Wales will continue to put their trust in the Labour party and in the Government, and will certainly do so whenever a general election comes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
