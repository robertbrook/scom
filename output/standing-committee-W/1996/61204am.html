<section>
<div class='page-header'><h1>Implications of the Budget for Wales</h1></div>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. William Hague)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee has considered the matter of the implications of the Budget for Wales.</p></blockquote>
May I be the first to welcome you, Mr. Hughes, to the Chair of what is the first sitting of the Grand Committee in 1996? Many of us had hoped that there would have been other meetings in the interim and that those sittings would have made use of the new procedures that were approved by the House of Commons a year or so ago. The procedures make provision for Back Benchers to raise short debates and for there to be more Question Time sessions, but sadly, the Opposition Front Bench has not yet agreed to make regular use of such procedures.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rhodri Morgan <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State tell us what the Conservative Whips Office has said to the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Clifton-Brown)? In Welsh questions recently, he seemed to be under the impression that the Welsh Grand Committee had met frequently in Wales during the past 12 months. On what was that misinformation based?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, my hon. Friend had not had contact with the Whips Office or anyone else, otherwise he would have known the position.<br><br>
It has been a mystery to us why the Opposition Front Bench has not wanted to utilise the new procedures. I do not associate the hon. Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. Morgan) with being shy of asking questions, but for some reason Opposition Members are curiously shy of asking questions on a more regular basis. However, no doubt we shall resolve the problem in the end. Although it has not been an active year for the Welsh Grand Committee, it has been—more importantly—a highly active and successful year for the Welsh economy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ron Davies <span class='memberconstituency'>(Caerphilly)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It will be a long speech if I am regularly interrupted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. As the Secretary of State saw fit to say that the Welsh Grand Committee has not met for a long time, I have some points to put to him. He will recall that he gave me an assurance in the Chamber, which I accepted in good faith, that the arrangements for the Welsh Grand Committee would continue as they had hitherto on the basis of an
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
agreement between the Government and the Opposition. Will he now confirm that he is not prepared to honour that undertaking?<br><br>
Will he further confirm that I have written to him on three occasions urging that the Welsh Grand Committee sits to discuss, respectively, the problem of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in Wales, the Sea Empress oil disaster in Pembrokeshire and the child abuse scandal in north Wales? On each occasion, the right hon. Gentleman frustrated any meeting of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remain firmly of the view that arrangements for the Grand Committee must be agreed by the usual channels. It is also my view that the procedures that have been approved by the House, which were widely welcomed by members on both sides of the Committee, should be used. Of course, the subjects for debate must be chosen evenly between Opposition and Conservative Members. In fact, the hon. Member for Caerphilly (Mr. Davies) will recall that in my last letter to him on the subject I offered him the opportunity to choose two of the next three subjects for debate between now and the end of the parliamentary session. However, because he does not want to use the procedures for Question Time and short debates, it has not been possible to agree on that. I am glad that I have had the opportunity fully to explain the position.<br><br>
The success of the Welsh economy will be enhanced by the Budget that my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer presented a little more than a week ago. The economic prospects for Wales are now the best that they have been for a generation. We have a tremendous combination of low inflation, low interest rates, booming exports and falling unemployment. The International Monetary Fund report that was published in July stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"The UK's economic performance is enviable".</p></blockquote>
That is different from what the IMF would have said about it 20 years ago—then it would have been enviable only to someone who was completely bankrupt. Now, the United Kingdom's economic performance is envied by countries throughout the world.<br><br>
That performance is set to continue. We forecast 2.5 per cent. growth for this year and 3.5 per cent. for next year. The IMF and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development agree that the British economy will be the fastest growing economy in Europe this year and next year. It is our fifth year of sustained growth. Our gross domestic product is now 8 per cent. above its previous peak; business investment was up by 6 per cent. in the first three quarters of this year; investment and consumption are showing sustained growth; export volumes have increased by more than 30 per cent. in three years; and the current account is at its best for nine years. That is an outstanding record and one that we want to continue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ted Rowlands <span class='memberconstituency'>(Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman mentioned the significance of low interest rates. Can he guarantee that they will remain low?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that members of the Government must not comment on or
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0552">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
forecast the path of interest rates. They are subject to the decision of my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor, in consultation with the Governor of the Bank of England. During the past few years, my right hon. and learned Friend has clearly achieved a period of remarkable stability and low interest rates, which has been the reason for our incredibly successful economic record.<br><br>
The Budget presented last week by my right hon. and learned Friend took no risks and did nothing to jeopardise those achievements. It outlined a variety of proposals to help small businesses. As a result, they will be even better placed in future to take advantage of the situation. The Budget will be a considerable help to small businesses in Wales. The small company rate of corporation tax comes down to 23 per cent., in line with the standard rate of income tax. That rate was 38 per cent. when the Opposition last had their grubby paws on it.<br><br>
Employers national insurance contributions are to be reduced, further widening the competitive advantage that this country has over the over-regulated, overtaxed and overburdened economies of continental Europe. Business rates for small properties are being frozen, which will benefit almost 80,000 small firms in Wales. Four fifths of all business rate payers in Wales will benefit from the freeze in business rates in the coming year. The VAT registration threshold has been increased.<br><br>
Those changes are on top of other measures being pursued by the Welsh Office to help small businesses in Wales. People are being helped to start up in business through training and enterprise council start-up schemes. Indeed, some 2,000 unemployed people are being helped to set up in business. The small firms training scheme, the loan guarantee scheme, the small firms merit award for research and technology—SMART awards—and support for products under research—the SPUR scheme—and the work of the new business connect network all add up to a good package of measures.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Llew Smith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Blaenau Gwent)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State has outlined what he believes to be the wonderful things included in the Budget. Does he accept that if we go for a single currency, the Budget will not be decided by the Government of the day but by the European central bank? Does he also accept that article 107 of the treaty states quite plainly that it would be illegal for the Government—or, dare I say it, even a Welsh Assembly—to try to influence the European central bank?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It will not surprise the hon. Gentleman to learn that I do not intend to make an announcement today about single currencies. It may be a great disappointment to him. It is important to stay in the negotiations on a single currency because it will affect us whether we are in or out of it. There will come a time, of course, when we will have to decide whether we wish to go in to a single currency, and the points made by the hon. Gentleman will doubtless be weighed in the balance then.<br><br>
Before the hon. Gentleman so helpfully intervened, I was saying that our help for small businesses comes on
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
top of a healthy economic background. It is no surprise that the <i>Western Mail</i> should report last week that my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor was being credited with having delivered the best Budget for Welsh business for a decade.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Hain <span class='memberconstituency'>(Neath)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can I test the right hon. Gentleman's shyness on the matter of a single currency? Can he envisage circumstances in which a single currency would benefit Wales?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not speculate about the advantages or disadvantages of a single currency. On many public occasions, I have listed the possible advantages and disadvantages of a single currency, of all which must be taken into account when making any decision in the future.<br><br>
The background to the Budget is one of rising living standards. After the Budget and after the rises in earnings over recent years, a family will be £20 a week better off than it was in 1992. That process will be further assisted by the reduction in income tax announced in the Budget. Britain has a sensible tax system with the lowest main rate of corporation tax of any European Union country. We have the lowest total business taxation of any G7 country, except Canada. We have pursued structural economic reforms—privatisation, deregulation and labour market reforms—all of which the Opposition trenchantly opposed at the time, but which are now widely praised throughout the world. They have given us a more flexible and less inflation-prone economy. Our business sector productivity has grown faster than in any other industrial economy since 1979.<br><br>
The United Kingdom is attracting record levels of inward investment, much of which is coming to Wales—a subject to which I shall return in a moment. Inflation has remained below 4 per cent. for more than four years. Unemployment is falling steadily. The United Kingdom now has a higher proportion of people in work than any other major European economy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dafydd Wigley <span class='memberconstituency'>(Caernarfon)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman mentioned the 1p reduction in the rate of income tax. We note that there are no papers before us on the detailed effects of the Budget on Wales. Will he confirm that Welsh Office spending on housing is one of the items being slashed to fund that 1p reduction in income tax? The implication of the reduction in housing spending from £89 million to £60 million is that only 1,000 houses a year will be built, rather than the 5,000 houses that are needed. Will not the consequences of that cut be that homeless people will not be accommodated; that social workers, who are already under pressure, will be yet more overworked; and that the building sector, which needs money to build houses and sustain its activities, will be depressed yet again?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope to make my statement on public expenditure next week on the Floor of the House. As the Welsh Office baseline expenditure has been increased in the Budget in all three years of the public expenditure survey, the hon. Gentleman should realise that any tax reduction is not financed from the Welsh block. The Budget has increased public spending provision for Wales, so in no way has there been the trade off that the hon. Gentleman alleged.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0553">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Hanson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Delyn)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very interested in what the right hon. Gentleman has said. According to the Welsh Office press release that was issued with the Budget, there will be a 2.3 per cent. real terms cut in Welsh Office public expenditure by 1998–99, a 0.9 per cent. cut next year and a 0.9 per cent. cut the year after that. Does the right hon. Gentleman accept those figures, which were in his own press release? If he accepts them, which public services in Wales will be cut and by how much will rates in counties such as mine—Flintshire—increase to compensate for those cuts in services.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman looks more carefully at the figures, he will see that all of the baselines for Welsh Office spending have been increased compared with the baselines at the time of last year's budget. The forecast Welsh Office expenditure for the coming years is higher for all the years of the public expenditure survey than it was forecast to be at this time last year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What about the figures?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly accept those figures. It will be interesting to discover whether Labour Members accept them. If they think that those are not the appropriate figures for Welsh Office expenditure, they should tell us whether they think that the figures should be higher, lower or about the same.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ron Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I imagine that the hon. Member for Caerphilly is seeking to intervene to tell me whether he thinks those figures should be higher or lower.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the time comes and I am sitting on the Government Benches and right hon. Gentleman is sitting on the Opposition Benches, he can quiz us about our budget, but he is now answerable for his budget. I want him to clarify the answer that he gave to the question about the press release asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson). I refer him to page 2 of the press release—I am sure that he has it in mind if not in hand—and the proposed spending plans for 1998–99, which show an expenditure of £6,888 million. The spending plans for 1997–98—the financial year that we are debating—show an expenditure of £6,900 million. That means that there is a cut in cash terms of £20 million, which represents a cut in real terms of 2.3 per cent. There is no way that the Secretary of State can argue that that is an increase in expenditure either in cash terms or in real terms. It is a reduction, which is plain for all to see in his press release.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That figure is an increase on the figures that we published last year. I shall return to the subject of public expenditure control, as it is important that hon. Members should say whether they agree with the figures—<i>[Interruption.]</i> There is no point in Plaid Cymru Members making noises about that, because if they had their way there would be no calls by Wales on the United Kingdom Treasury—Wales would no longer be connected to the United Kingdom Treasury and none of that money would be available.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams <span class='memberconstituency'>(Carmarthen)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Following on from what my hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly said, page 2 of the Welsh Office press release, issued on the day of the Budget, shows that the precentage change in real terms year by year is a negative figure—it is a cut. I cite the Secretary of State's own figures for each year: - 0.9 per cent.; - 0.9 per cent.; - 2.3 per cent.; and - 1.6 per cent. That means that, if a Conservative Government are returned at the election, there will be a 5 per cent. cut in the Welsh Office budget over the next four years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, that is not right. The figures are not cumulative; the hon. Gentleman has added them up incorrectly. There is no 5 per cent. cut.<br><br>
I return to the important subject of the Government's public spending plans, which are extremely clear—the numbers are set out plainly. We want to know whether Opposition Members agree with them. They seem to be suggesting that they do not, so we ant to know what numbers they would prefer and whether they believe that public expenditure should be higher. If so, the hon. Member for Caerphilly will have to run off to the right hon. Member for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown) to get permission to say so. At the moment, he does not have permission to say that Welsh Office expenditure would be higher under a Labour Government than it is under a Conservative Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cynog Dafis <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion and Pembroke, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I would try the Red Book, which gives figures under the heading:
<br><blockquote><p>"Control Total by department in real terms"</p></blockquote>
and clearly shows that the grant to the Welsh Office will be reduced. In 1996–97, the figure is £6.7 billion in real terms; in 1997–98, it is £6.6 billion; in 1998–99, it is £6.4 billion; and in 1999–2000 it is £6.3 billion. Can those figures be interpreted in any way as a real terms increase?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What is very clear from other tables in the Red Book is that Welsh Office baselines are being increased in the Budget. The hon. Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley) asked whether there was a trade-off in the Budget between tax reductions made by my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor and provision for the Welsh block. The answer is that there is not. In the Budget, provision for the Welsh block has been increased in every year to which the Budget applies.<br><br>
The reforms of the 1980s and 1990s have created a vastly improved economic situation, in which Wales is sharing. I have said many times that my highest priority is to assist the flow of jobs into Wales. We are able to do that because we have a more flexible and competitive economy and a more diverse and well-balanced industrial structure.<br><br>
The number of production businesses in Wales has increased by 50 per cent. since 1979. Indigenous companies now work alongside inward investors. Welsh steel-making is among the most efficient in Europe. Manufacturing has again become a Welsh success story. Wales is the only part of the United Kingdom where manufacturing employment has
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0554">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
increased over the past 10 years. Manufacturing output in Wales rose by almost 5 per cent. in the year to June and by 10 per cent. over the past two years, while productivity in Wales was 7 per cent. above the UK average in 1993 and 9 per cent. above the UK average in 1994. The UK average has also been improving quickly. We must add to those successes the advantage of British non-wage labour costs: a UK employer spends £18 in non-wage labour costs—national insurance contributions and so on—for every £100 of wages, compared with £31 in Germany, £34 in Spain, £41 in France and £44 in Italy.<br><br>
Those factors have made the UK an ideal business location and, within the UK, Wales is a particularly ideal business location. I have been pleased by the business surveys in recent months which show confidence among businesses in Wales at or among the highest level in the UK.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall in a moment, but I have already given way to the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
About 100,000 more people have found work in Wales over the past decade; unemployment is falling steadily and fell below 100,000 last month for the first time in many years. We know that more jobs are on the way. We have had a record-breaking year in terms of inward investment—so far this year, 128 projects, 13,600 jobs and £2.4 billion of new investment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: New jobs?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, new jobs; safeguard jobs are in addition to them.<br><br>
Names like Halla, US Can, Newport Wafer-Fab, Ford, JCB and LG are bringing good-quality jobs to a range of industrial sectors and a wide range of benefits to our economy—not just the huge benefit of 75,000 people in Wales now working for overseas-owned companies, but the benefit of displaced imports and increased imports, reduced social payments, contributions to the Exchequer, management techniques from abroad meshing with our own and the potential for increased business for all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I check on an aspect of the right hon Gentleman's figures for employed and unemployed? Will he confirm that the increase in the overall size of the work force in Wales since 1979 is due to the huge increase in part-time jobs, mainly for women? In fact, the figures show that somewhere between 80,000 and 100,000—I cannot give the exact figure—fewer men are in full-time employment. That is disgraceful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a flow of jobs of every description into Wales. Much of the rise in employment over several years has been in a different kind of employment—a kind that the hon. Gentleman should not disparage. Many women wanted to come into the work force through flexible, part-time jobs. The fact that our economy has been able to provide such jobs is a tremendous boost and adds significantly to the incomes of many households. We should not regard such employment as a second-class economy.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is making a serious point and I will ask a serious question. The non-wage costs have not disappeared; they have been transferred to the state in the form of family credit and rising unemployment benefits. Is that why we have the unique situation of public finances disconnected from the economy?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The countries with which I compared the UK have not only those non-wage costs, but a very expensive social security and welfare system. Many have a larger budget deficit than our own. I do not think that the connection that the hon. Gentleman was trying to make is valid.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alan Williams <span class='memberconstituency'>(Swansea, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely, my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) is correct. Table 4A.1 of the Red Book shows that social security contributions from 1995 to 1996 and up to the next financial year have increased by £5 billion. Given that, and the fact that the right hon. Gentleman is rejoicing that he has reduced employers' contributions, does not that mean that even more than £5 billion has come from employees?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What it means is that because employment has grown, many more people are paying national insurance contributions—or having them paid for them by employers—than has been the case during the past few years. Of course, revenue grows when more people move into work. The point that I was making about international comparisons was from the standpoint of the employer who is deciding where to locate jobs. The United Kingdom has a substantial advantage; I think that the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney and I at least agree about that.<br><br>
This week has brought more good news on the jobs front. On Monday, Lindale and Chambers announced 220 new jobs in mid-Wales. Today, two more significant inward investment successes have been announced—HSBC Gibbs is expanding its insurance services, creating 100 new jobs and safeguarding 250 jobs with a £1.5 million investment, and Kyushu Matsushita Electric—a company that I visited in Japan in September—is commencing the manufacture of digital cordless telephones with an £11 million investment that will create 100 jobs and safeguard another 110 jobs. Both of those are expansions of existing operations.<br><br>
It is a striking feature of our inward investment success that so many companies want to reinvest in Wales because of the outstanding performance of the work force and the attractive business environment. Both of those expansions are in the Newport area, but I expect in the near future to be able to announce further projects bringing up to 2,000 new jobs in a variety of locations. Our inward investment success is set to continue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nick Ainger <span class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Secretary of State accept that for every £1 of inward investment there is £3 of exported investment? Can he explain why he thinks British companies are seeking to export investment, instead of investing in this country?</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We now live in a global economy, as the hon. Gentleman may have noticed. The nature of the international economy has changed dramatically during the past 15 years. British companies have been investing in this country and elsewhere, where it is profitable to do so. It is entirely in the interests of the economy of this country that they should do that. The good news to add to the success of those British companies is that when companies from the United States and the far east want to set up an operation in Europe, they tend to turn to the United Kingdom and to invest here, not in continental Europe. Of course, an increased proportion of investment by companies right across the global economy is made in countries other than their own because there is now global competition and we have a world of much freer trade than that of 20 years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rod Richards <span class='memberconstituency'>(Clwyd, North-West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my right hon. Friend agree that investment by British companies abroad generates profits from which pension funds benefit?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is quite right. It is welcome that British companies are finding profitable opportunities. That is helping to develop one of the other great competitive advantages for the future of the United Kingdom economy—the £600 billion that British people hold in pension funds, which is more than is held by the whole of the rest of Europe put together.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Hain <span class='memberconstituency'>(Neath)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will give way to the hon. Gentleman, but then in the interests of time I must make some progress with my speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hain</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Secretary of State for giving way. Will he confirm that, despite the rosy picture that he paints of inward investment, Britain's share of inward investment is no higher than it was under Clement Attlee's Labour Government of the 1940s?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the whole of the rest of continental Europe was in ruins during the late 1940s, that may be understandable. It is remarkable that we are doing just as well now, in the 1990s, when continental Europe has been rebuilt. If continental Europe cannot do better than it did in the 1940s, it is doing a lot of things wrong. The hon. Gentleman's party is dedicated to copying many of the things done in the 1940s in continental Europe.<br><br>
What lessons should we learn from our inward investment success? How do we take it forward? There are many lessons to learn—although the thoughts of the hon. Member for Neath (Mr. Hain) are not among them. The first lesson is that we must encourage and assist home-grown companies to take maximum advantage of our success. The Welsh Development Agency's initiative, Source Wales, is bringing many orders to Welsh companies and creating supplier parks. We must encourage companies to realise that something like the LG investment represents one of the greatest supplier opportunities in the history of Europe. I was delighted to go to Alignrite in Bridgend a few weeks ago, where
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
200 jobs were announced—partly due to confidence in the industry because of the LG investment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd <span class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the good news that the Secretary of State has imparted, but what does he intend to do about the imbalance in job creation between east and west Wales?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly the point I am making in talking about the lessons from inward investment and how to take that forward.<br><br>
First, we must emphasise that the same assistance is available to both home-grown and overseas companies. There is a common misconception about that. I quoted figures in the Chamber the other day showing that in the past 10 years of regional selective assistance, £213 million went to overseas-owned companies and £215 to indigenous companies. We have given £88 million of regional selective assistance in the past five years to 660 small and medium-sized companies. However, the success of the Welsh economy is not just for inward investors—they are an important part of that success, but they are not the whole story.<br><br>
Secondly, we must be alive to opportunities to spread more widely the actual incidence of inward investment—a point that was made by the hon. Member for Meirionydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd). The benefits can already be spread more widely. The people who will supply LG are located in a wide variety of places. They do not have to be in Newport; they can be in any part of Wales. But, of course, we must take every opportunity to encourage inward investors to locate nearer to the pockets of higher unemployment, such as south Pembrokeshire, the valleys and Holyhead, which stand out as having the highest unemployment in Wales. We cannot direct businesses or tell them where to go, but can enourage them through setting the Welsh Development Agency targets for investment outside the eastern M4 and A55 corridors and by asking the Development Board for Rural Wales to move half of its activity to the west, which we have done. We are trying to ensure that the WDA takes particular care to consider strategic sites in the west and the north.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Walter Sweeney <span class='memberconstituency'>(Vale of Glamorgan)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my right hon. Friend agree that an important feature in attracting inward investment is to have good road and rail communications? In south Wales it is important to improve the road links to Cardiff international airport as a link road would make it much more attractive to passengers as well as to importers and exporters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The improvement and expansion of the transport infrastructure in the airport's operations is a tremendous success story already. It offers great potential for my hon. Friend's constituency. I have done some preparatory work on possible improvements to the road, but how we can make progress on that depends on local authority plans for improvements to the road links. My hon. Friend was right to draw attention to that topic because, overall, we have invested £1.4 billion in Welsh roads since 1997. The second Severn crossing was opened this year and we have important plans for further developments, through the private finance initiative, for the A55, the A465 and the M4.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0556">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
The other part of our infrastructure that we must continue to develop is our human resources and the skills available in the Welsh economy, which are crucial for people to gain access to well-paid jobs. My predecessor, my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood), set out a Welsh skills strategy in the document "People and Prosperity", which has led to many actions that are improving the skills of the Welsh economy. I am paying particular attention to the expansion and improvement of modern apprenticeships—last year some 1,200 people started in modern apprenticeships in manufacturing. I have made money available to the TECs this year to increase their provision. Over 1994 and 1997, the Welsh Office will have contracted with TECs for 8,200 young people to start modern apprenticeships.<br><br>
Employers also make a vital contribution to training. I am encouraged by the survey by the Confederation of British Industry, which shows employers investing proportionately more in training in Wales than in the rest of the United Kingdom. Of course, they can be important in education as well.<br><br>
I shall be setting new targets in the new year for the achievement of basic skills in Welsh schools, building on the improved school performance results in this year's examinations, where 70 per cent. of schools had improved GCSE grades.<br><br>
Another important aspect of our infrastructure is multimedia, where Wales has an opportunity to have a head start on the rest of the British economy and the European economy. Telecommunications is one sector where the United Kingdom as a whole can have a tremendous advantage because of the policies that have been pursued by the Government. In Wales we shall develop a head start for the 130 business parks to be cabled over the next five years, with half a million homes and businesses in south Wales having access to fibre optic cable by 2001 and with the new multimedia park in Cardiff bay.<br><br>
If we are to maintain our inward investment's success we must also maintain policies that have brought that success, and not entertain ideas of minimum wages, social chapters, working-time directives and all the other nonsense that is supported by Labour Members. We need a continuation of the labour market policies that have brought jobs to Wales and have reduced the number of strikes in Wales to 15 for every 1,000 workers last year, compared with 1,590 in 1979.<br><br>
We need to continue to develop a tax system that rewards success and we need careful control of public expenditure—which brings me to some of the questions raised earlier by hon. Members. In the Budget, my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor reduced the planned total of Government spending in the coming year by £2 billion, but he increased provision for the Welsh block compared with what was provided in last year's Budget—an increase of £70 million on the previous baseline. Although the whole Government must play their part in the control of—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainger</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is important that I finish what I am saying. I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman in a moment.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
Although the whole government must play their part in the control of public expenditure, the special needs and position of Wales have once again been recognised. I shall anounce my proposal for expenditure next week, although I have already suggested that the health service will be a high priority. However, it will always be important for all aspects of Government—central Government and local government—to strive to deliver better value for money. We have been doing that in the Welsh Office. The miming costs of the Welsh Office in the past three years have been reduced in cash terms, let alone in real terms. The running costs of the non-departmental public bodies—and this is contrary to what was suggested by the hon. Member for Caerphilly a couple of weeks ago—have been constant in cash terms for the past three years. That means that, in real terms, they have fallen. It will be important to maintain that success in the coming year and to make the best possible use of the private finance initiative. It is also important for local authorities to understand that these factors apply to them as well.<br><br>
The figures that I published last week included those for aggregate external finance—the money that we give from the Welsh Office block to local authorities. They will have an increase next year of 2.6 per cent., which is about or slightly more than the forecast rate of inflation. That is an increase of £64 million in cash terms and proportionately a larger increase than will be given to local authorities in England or Scotland. We will continue to provide 88 per cent. of local authority funding from central Government resources compared with 77 per cent. in England—[<i>Interruption.</i>] I have more figures, but the hon. Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths) is bursting to speak so I shall give way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman said that the overall increase in the allocation to local government is roughly the same as inflation. Will he confirm that if he takes out what has been allocated specifically to police forces in Wales and the budget for community care, local authorities will receive only 1.6 per cent. more, which is less than inflation? On top of that, they must provide additional services through their local government duties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is no good taking out this or that to make the figures look different. The total figure is rising by 2.6 per cent. If the hon. Gentleman believes that it should rise by more than that, I hope that that will be confirmed when I write to the shadow Chancellor to ask whether that is the policy of the Labour party. Let the hon. Gentleman say whether he wants to add to the 2.6 per cent. and to provide a larger increase for local authority spending in Wales.<br><br>
Our spending already means that aggregate external finance per head in Wales in the coming year will be £884 per head—that is the amount that central Government gives to local government in Wales—compared with £731 in England. That is a wider differential than last year, when the difference was £130. In the coming year there will be a £150 advantage for Welsh local authorities. That is a fair settlement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the Secretary of State has the Red Book available, but I shall quote
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0557">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
briefly from it. The right hon. Gentleman said that in cash terms there has been an increase from the current financial year to the next financial year. That is correct, but table 5A.5 in the Red Book shows clearly that in the current financial year the control total for the Welsh Office is £6.7 billion. Next year in real terms it will be £6.6 billion, a cut in real terms of £100 million. Does the right hon. Gentleman accept the figures in the Red Book and that the overall services provided by the Welsh Office will have to be cut as a result of that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall have to recap on some of what I have said. Of course I accept the figures in the Red Book, although I want to know whether others accept those figures as the basis for public finances. I have made it clear that all parts of Government must play their part in the control of public expenditure. I had thought that the Labour party had finally been converted to that idea, but evidently it has not crept into some elements of the Labour party in Wales. I have also made it clear that the Government must continue to obtain better value from the money that they spend by reducing running costs, running non-departmental public bodies very efficiently and obtaining more from each pound that is spent on public services. We have done very well at that.<br><br>
The figures in the Red Book are clear. All parts of Government are contributing to a reduction in the public share of gross domestic puroduct over the coming years to enable us to hit our target of 40 per cent. or less of GDP being spent by the state. The position of that Welsh Office has been extremely well protected in that process because it is receiving a cash increase in its budget which is not available to many other Departments of State in the current round.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have not given way to the hon. Gentleman before, so I shall do so now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Touhig</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State referred to efficiencies and how well run the various nongovernmental departments are. Will he comment on the running of the south and east Wales ambulance trust and say whether it is an efficient way of using public resources?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows—and as the Under-Secretary of State for Wales, my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North (Mr. Jones) explained recently at Question Time—various action has been taken. I understand that the trading position has now stabilised, but my officials are closely monitoring what is happening in that trust. What is undeniable is that the health service in general has delivered vastly better value for money in recent years in treating many more patients than before and doing so to wide satisfaction.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alex Carlile <span class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomery)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I must get on. I might consider giving way to the hon. and learned Gentleman in the last few minutes of my remarks. I was not sure who he was for a moment.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
The levels of council tax depend on the decisions of local authorities, on their success in council tax collection and on changes in the tax base, but let it be absolutely clear from the figures that I am giving to the Committee that there will be no justification for average council tax rises on anything like the scale of last year, and no justification for the average level of council tax increases in Wales to be higher than those in England—in cash terms, they should be significantly lower than in England.<br><br>
Hon. Members who believe that the settlement is insufficient should say how much they would prefer to spend—whether it should be higher, lower or the same—and tell the Committee what they will say to their local authorities when they have meetings about these matters in the next few weeks. Will they say, "Of course, we would provide more money than that"? If so, they must make sure that they have cleared that with their colleagues—which, of course, they will not have done. Let them try to respond to the clear statement of priority that we have made about the national health service, which I shall repeat. Every year for the next five years, a Conservative Government will increase spending on the national health service in Wales over and above the rate of inflation—something we have always done in the past 17 years—and over and above the retail prices index. I challenge the hon. Member for Caerphilly to match that statement, but he will not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Jonathan Evans)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He dare not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman dare not, as my hon. Friend says. Labour Members freely criticise the spending that we allocate to local authorities, but they are frightened to commit themselves to spending on the health service in the way that we have done. The hon. Member for Caerphilly always tells me that he must look at the books. If he thinks that Ministers choosing between priorities find the answer written in any book, he will be in for a terrible disappointment if he ever holds this office.<br><br>
I commit the Conservative Government to increase spending on the NHS every year in Wales because I know that it will need it. Anyone who knows anything about the health service knows that it will need it. People now want to know from the Labour party whether it is unable to match my promise because it wants to spend money on something else, or whether it is unable to match my promise because, if there were a Welsh Assembly, it could not deliver the increases that we are able to deliver from the Welsh block. It is time that the Labour party was straight with people, otherwise people will remember that the only Government in modern times to have reduced spending on the health service was the last Labour Government.<br><br>
Being in Government involves choices, priorities and decisions. My priorities and those of my hon. Friends who represent Welsh constituencies are to continue to facilitate the flow of jobs and investment in Wales, to continue to upgrade our education system, to maintain and improve a world-class system of public health and to further the great success in the Welsh economy during the past year until the only gloomy faces left in Wales are those of Opposition Members.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ron Davies <span class='memberconstituency'>(Caerphilly)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State began his speech by referring to the fact that the Grand Committee had not met for 12 months. By the end of his speech, I felt that I would not suffer withdrawal symptoms if the Committee did not meet for another 12 months.<br><br>
I want to put two points on record. First, on the request for meetings of the Welsh Grand Committee, I have repeatedly written to the Secretary of State urging him to honour the undertakings that he gave on the Floor of the House, but he has flatly refused. Will he now confirm that had it not been for my specific request, this sitting of the Welsh Grand Committee, to debate the Budget, would not be taking place?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman has raised the matter again, let me again put to him the offer that I have already made to him in writing—that he can choose two of the next three subjects for debate, provided that Back Benchers also have the opportunity to ask questions and arrange short debates. Will he agree to that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the problem. The Conservative party has made dissembling and truth-avoidance a way of life. I asked the Secretary of State a perfectly simple question and I asked for a straightforward answer, but he failed to give one. That approach characterised his speech. Half a dozen of my right hon. and hon. Friends asked him a series of direct questions directly related to his press release, but not once would he give a straight answer.<br><br>
The way in which the Secretary of State and the Government have approached the Budget has destroyed any vestige of credibility that they might have had. The description that the right hon. Gentleman gave of the Welsh economy bears no relation to the economy and the society that I and other hon. Members representing Welsh constituencies experience day by day. His description does not tally with the real indices of the Welsh economy. There is no basis for long-term optimism or for the extravagant claims made by the Secretary of State. Key indices include investment, which is now growing more slowly despite the welcome addition of inward investment. Indeed, it is growing more slowly in the present recovery than in any other recovery this century. Less is invested per worker in Wales than in any other major competitor country.<br><br>
Next week, the Secretary of State will announce further cuts in the education and training budget, yet the United Kingdom is 42nd in the world skills league. The Secretary of State may believe that inward investment is the basis of future prosperity, but he should realise that we must also start investing in our people, especially the young, and raise their skills and qualifications. There is no evidence that the Government understand that, nor do they have any proposals to deal with it. The right hon. Gentleman skated over the question of inflation. Average inflation in the United Kingdom is now the highest of any other industrialised country, with the exception of Italy. The UK has fallen from 13th to 18th in the world prosperity league.<br><br>
The Secretary of State tried to tell us that the Budget had been well received. I shall remind him of some
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
reactions to it. The FTSE 100 index fell by 20 points while the Chancellor was speaking. That is a fair indication of the immediate reaction. Commentators had a chance on the following day to examine the Budget a little more carefully, <i>The Independent</i> reported the comments of various economists:
<br><blockquote><p>"'It incorporates fiddles that would make the French blush. I am staggered by it,' said Adam Cole, an economist at City brokers James Capel …. David Mackie, an expert at investment bank JP Morgan, said: 'It is not at all clear that the plans on paper can ever be delivered.'"</p></blockquote>
We agree with that analysis.<br><br>
The Secretary of State asked what Labour would do. Our answer is clear and direct—we do not believe the Government's claims; their statements are not credible, realistic or sustainable. Why do we not believe them? We have been here before—in 1992 they lied through their teeth because they were approaching a general election. They are now approaching another election and they are wilfully and deliberately seeking to mislead the public about the state of the nation's finances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sweeney</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will give way to the hon. Gentleman in a moment. I know that he is anxious to comment on our colleagues in Europe, so I shall cite one other example to excite his passions a little.<br><br>
On the day following the Budget, <i>The Times</i> stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"This is a shaky foundation for the Chancellor's forecast for improving public finances. It is the sort of thing Italy would get up to to meet the Maastricht criteria."</p></blockquote>
There was widespread, universal condemnation of the Budget among expert commentators. The hon. Member for Vale of Glamorgan (Mr. Sweeney) can now give us the benefit of his wisdom.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sweeney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way, but the point that I wanted to raise is now lost in the mists of time. The hon. Gentleman criticises the present level of inflation, but does he remember the achievements of his own party? Does he recall that in every year that the Labour Government were in power, they would have given their eye-teeth to have a level of inflation such as we now enjoy? Will he acknowledge that under the last Labour Government, the level of inflation peaked at 26 per cent.? How does he have the nerve to criticise this Government's performance on inflation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course I have the nerve. I well remember the Labour Government of 1974–79 struggling manfully with the problems left by the previous Conservative Government and the problems of the oil price hike. I well remember that unemployment figures were lower in 1979 than they have been in every year since. This Government have deliberately pushed up the number of unemployed to more than 2 million, whereas the Labour Government's central objective was to ensure that people had the opportunity to work. The basis for long-term prosperity lies in encouraging people to work and in developing their potential, not in engineering short-term boom and bust cycles as the Government have done, so that the economic cycle is in line with the political cycle.<br><br>

I am glad that the hon. Member for Vale of Glamorgan intervened. He was a great supporter of the previous Secretary of State. No doubt he voted for him in the leadership election, probably on the basis of the campaign slogan, "No change, no chance". I understand that there is a group of Conservative party supporters in the constituency of the hon. Member for Clwyd, West who are also adopting that slogan for the general election.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richards</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hughes. The hon. Member for Caerphilly described me as the hon. Member for Clwyd, West. I am the prospective parliamentary candidate for Clwyd, West, but I am currently the hon. Member for Clwyd, North-West.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course, it is the hon. Gentleman's would-be constituency party members in Clwyd, West who are running the campaign to deselect him. They believe in the slogan, "No change, no chance"; they want to fight the election with at least a chance of getting a Conservative candidate elected—not that they have any chance, which explains the hon. Gentleman's earlier interest in pension arrangements.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Clwyd, North-West, too, was a great supporter of the previous Secretary of State. I am sure that the present Secretary of State will be interested in his predecessor's description of the Budget. Writing in The Times on the Wednesday following the Budget, he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is not an election-winning budget"—</p></blockquote>
we can all agree on that—
<br><blockquote><p>"in the sense that it does not give away an awful lot of money that we can't afford to give away."</p></blockquote>
That is the Conservative strategy—to have an election-winning Budget, one gives away a lot of money that one cannot afford to give away. That is precisely what the Government did in 1992 and it is precisely what they want to do now, but we understand them better this time round. They won the last election in that way, but now they have been rumbled.<br><br>
The Conservative party wanted the Government to act like they did in 1992, and I have no doubt that, had the Chancellor believed that he could con the City, he would have produced such a Budget. He could neither con the City nor afford the tax bribes that the Conservative party wanted, however, so he has attempted to confuse and obfuscate the figures by changing the basis on which calculations are made in the hope that people will not understand what has happened.<br><br>
Let me remind the Secretary of State of how the Government did that in 1992. On 7 April 1992, the Prime Minister said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Low tax creates wealth. So we cut income tax. We cut it, and cut it, and cut it. We cut it, and cut it, and cut it again."</p></blockquote>
Since then, of course, the typical family has paid more than £2,000 more in tax. On 28 January 1992, the Prime Minister said in the House:
<br><blockquote><p>"I have no plans to raise … the level of national insurance contributions."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 28 January 1992; Vol. 202, c. 808.]</p></blockquote>
He then raised it from 9 per cent. to 10 per cent.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
The 1992 Conservative party manifesto stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"We will maintain mortgage tax relief."</p></blockquote>
It had been cut to 20 per cent. in April 1990 by the Conservative party—the party that believes in home ownership—and in April 1995, the Conservatives cut it to 15 per cent.<br><br>
Again on 28 January 1992, the Prime Minister said:
<br><blockquote><p>"There will be no VAT increase."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 28 January 1992; Vol. 202, c. 808.]</p></blockquote>
We know what that meant. That is why the Government are not trusted on tax or spending policies. That is why, when the Secretary of State fails to give us direct answers to our questions in Committee, we do not believe him. We do not believe the promises given in the Budget and the Government will pay a heavy price for that.<br><br>
The Secretary of State expects us to believe that he has now achieved a miraculous hat trick. He said that he has managed to achieve tax reductions, coupled with increases in public expenditure and, at the same time, reductions in the public sector borrowing requirement. That is remarkable and I shall examine each of those three claims. We know that compared with the position before the last election, the typical family is paying £2,120 more in tax. That is a commonly accepted figure.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman cannot claim that the Conservative party wants to cut tax, nor can he claim that the Budget will cut tax. When he had had the chance to analyse the Budget, even the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, in an interview on London Weekend Television, admitted that the average person is now £50 a year worse off in direct taxes since 1992.<br><br>
Indirect taxes have risen, too. Six specific taxes were increased in the Budget—insurance premium was increased; air passenger tax was doubled; tax relief on profit-related pay was abolished; prescription charges were increased; fuel duties rose by 5 per cent. above inflation and tobacco duties rose by 3 per cent. above inflation.<br><br>
The Red Book reveals that certain taxes have increased by £1,085 million as a result of the Budget, while others have been reduced by £735 million, which is a net tax increase of £350 million. It is no wonder that we do not believe the Government when they say that they want to cut taxes. As a percentage of national income, taxes will rise from 35.75 per cent. this year to 36.25 next year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not a tax cut.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed it is not.<br><br>
In 1979, as a percentage of national income, taxes were 34.25 per cent. As a result of the decisions taken in this and previous Budgets, the tax burden will increase each year until the year 2002. In 1979, the year of the last Labour Government, 32.2p of each pound of a typical family's gross income went to the Exchequer. This year, that figure has risen to at least 33.7p<br><br>
Wales is doubly disadvantaged by the Government's policies. First, we stand to benefit less from any direct tax cuts because incomes in Wales are so much lower than elsewhere. Secondly, we suffer more disproportionately from public expenditure cuts because of our greater reliance on public expenditure.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0560">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sweeney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the fact that the rate of direct taxes have been reduced so substantially since the Conservative party came to office has generated increased success in the economy? The net result is that although people are paying less tax, there is an increased take from taxation. People appear to be paying more tax, but the reality is that they have more money in their pockets. The average family is substantially better off under a Conservative Government because we believe in an enterprise economy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is making a speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly do not recognise the economy that the hon. Gentleman has described. I was citing percentages of national income. It does not matter how much national income increases or decreases, it is the percentage of national income that is paid in tax that is important.<br><br>
I shall illustrate the impact of those figures in Wales. The average weekly earnings for full-time workers in the United Kingdom is £331; in Wales it is £291. So, using the single index to which the hon. Member for Vale of Glamorgan wanted to refer—the change in the standard rate of income tax—the benefit to Great Britain as a whole is more than £90; the benefit to Wales is less than £70. The point that I was making is that we suffer more because incomes are less in Wales.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richards</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. Gentleman has said is grossly misleading. He seems not to understand that when people receive increases in salary, they pay tax on every pound of that increase—therefore, the tax that they pay increases. He seems to forget that because the basic rate of tax has decreased, people are paying far less than they would have done—certainly far less than if the basic rate of tax had stayed at 33p in the pound, as it was in 1979 under a Labour Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that argument. I acknowledge that the basic rate of income tax has decreased, but other taxes, both direct and indirect, have increased—<i>[Interruption.]</i> The Government have acknowledged that the average family's tax bill increased by more than £2,000 from 1992 to 1996. On Sunday, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury acknowledged that direct taxes will increase as a result of the Budget. Obviously, the hon. Member for Clwyd, North-West is in some confusion because the Prime Minister confirmed on the Floor of the House what the Chief Secretary had said on television on Sunday.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richards</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not give way to the hon. Gentleman—perhaps he will have an opportunity to make a speech later. He must check his facts.<br><br>
I said that I would consider the change in the basic rate of tax and exclude all other changes. I shall now consider in detail one of the other changes—that in council tax. Some of my hon. Friends have already challenged the Secretary of State on that matter. We do not yet know the figures—the Secretary of State will announce them next week—but we can make some
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
reasonable assumptions about them. First, let us assume that one accurate figure is that announced in last week's spending totals in the Budget—that is, that there will be a 0.4 per cent. decrease in the overall support for local authorities in Wales. Secondly, let us assume that the capping figure will be the average English figure—about 1.5 per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Support for local authorities will increase by 2.6 per cent. in the coming year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is quoting figures that he will release next week in the House. We have not yet seen them. I must use the figures that we were given last week.<br><br>
If like is compared with like and inflation is taken into account, local authorities' resources will decrease by 0.4 per cent. next year. The impact of that will be that the council tax for an average band D property in Wales will increase by 10 per cent. next year. My hon. Friend the Member for Delyn, who represents part of Flintshire, asked what the impact of that increase would be there, but the Secretary of State could not give an answer. Well, I can give the answer—there will be a £50 increase in the council tax levied on such a property in Flintshire. In Camarthenshire, the increase will be £55; in Neath and Port Talbot, it will be £54; in Ceredigion, it will be more than £50. Council tax will increase substantially. Yet again, that demonstrates the classic Tory trick of giving a little with one hand and taking a lot more with the other.<br><br>
Local government will be so badly hit by the settlement that not only will it have to impose a heavy, additional and unacceptable burden on its council tax payers, but there will be substantial cuts in expenditure. Aberconwy and Colwyn, for example, forecast a reduction of about £6 million in vital public services, Powys forecasts a cut of about £6 million—5 per cent. of its budget—and, the Vale of Glamorgan faces a cut of about £6 million on top of heavy council tax increases, which stem directly from the Government's spending policies and decisions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would it be fair to conclude from what the hon. Gentleman says that he thinks that the support that we give local government in Wales should be more generous?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are debating the Government's Budget; when the time comes, I will be perfectly happy to debate our Budget. Let me remind the Secretary of State of what was said by a candidate who will be fighting the general election on his party's behalf in Wales—he is the prospective parliamentary candidate, or the parliamentary candidate, as I understand he describes himself, in Clwyd, West—[<i>hon. Members:</i> "Clwyd, North-West."] I am sorry, Clwyd, North-West. No change, no chance—they are at it already. That prospective parliamentary candidate for the Conservative party wrote in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> of 20 November:
<br><blockquote><p>"The trouble is just that the Tories lack credibility on tax, on their own intentions and those of the Opposition."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0561">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
He knows that, at the last election, the Conservative party lied about its intentions and lied about ours. The article continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"The truth is that … the Tories can't do much to restore their credibility on tax."</p></blockquote>
I look forward to the public meetings that will be held with the Secretary of State and poor old Boris Johnson in Clwyd, North-West to explain those statements. That is one leg of the triple crown of tax cuts, public expenditure increases and the public-sector borrowing requirement that does not stand up.<br><br>
Briefly, on the public expenditure proposals, last year, we repeatedly tried to get the Secretary of State to confirm that public expenditure would fall in real terms. Time after time, I have read our discussions recorded in <i>Hansard</i> and there was the same evasiveness and unwillingness to face the truth last year as we have had this morning—the Secretary of State refused to come clean.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Delyn pointed out earlier, the Secretary of State's press release confirms that there will be a drop of 0.9 per cent.—a decrease of more than £60 million in 1995–96 prices—in the estimated out-turn for 1996–97. There will be a similar cut the year after that and a cut of more than 2.3 per cent. by 1998–99. I do not believe that those estimates are realistic; the course set by the Budget is not sustainable.<br><br>
If cuts of that magnitude were enforced, given the spending priorities of the Government and the distortion of public finances by underperformance, the consequence for public services would be dreadful. All of us who represent Welsh constituencies have to grapple every day with the consequences of a failing health service, underfunded education and training and declining opportunities for work. It is impossible to build a stable, safe and secure community with an alienated and underprivileged underclass. We intend at the earliest opportunity to turn to the task of modernising and rebuilding.<br><br>
I have already referred to local authority expenditure. We will not know the final figures for the Welsh budget for several months. The Secretary of State keeps them under wraps, so that he can announce selective increases in public expenditure stage by stage and withhold from public gaze all the cuts in those programmes that are the direct consequence of his selection of priorities.<br><br>
The Secretary of State talked about the health service and made much of it. Every time he gives a commitment, he changes its wording. On 7 November, he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Welsh Office will match the guarantee given by the Prime Minister and promise that, within its budget, the national health service will get an increase over and above the level of inflation every year for the next five years."</p></blockquote>
I do not think that the Secretary of State believes that; I do not know why he had to qualify his commitment by using the words "within its budget". When he was questioned, he made it clear that the rate of inflation to which he referred was the general index of retail prices, not the rate of inflation in the national health service. We all know that the rate of inflation in the national
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
health service far exceeds the rate of inflation as measured by the RPI. Even if we accept the Secretary of State's figures at face value—I do not, as I shall explain—they show a cut in resources to the national health service.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why are they so hard to match?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe the Secretary of State's figures. They are not credible. The Government themselves do not believe them because within a few days of the right hon. Gentleman's statement, the Department of Health produced a press release showing an increase of 0.8 per cent. for next year—as the Secretary of State said and the basis on which the Conservatives can fight the election—but a cut of 0.7 per cent. the year after. So, according to the Department of Health's figures, by 1998–99 there will be a cut in resources. That is why I do not believe the Secretary of State or the Government. The Government have lost credibility and consistently seek deliberately to mislead the British people about the state of public finances and to withhold from the people of Wales the consequences of their spending decisions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is up to the hon. Gentleman whether he believes the commitment I have given. Does he think that spending on the health service should be increased by more than the rate of inflation each year—measured either by the RPI or, if he prefers, by a health service indicator of inflation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State asked a direct question and I shall give a direct answer. I am ashamed to live in a country governed by a Government who have for 17 years, used mass unemployment as an instrument of economic policy and have so consistently mismanaged the economy that we cannot afford to provide a decent level of health care or decent opportunities for young people in our schools. I am ashamed to live in a country that cannot fund public services propery as a result of economic mismanagement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In shall in a moment. The Department of Health press release shows that there will be a reduction in resources. Does the Secretary of State accept the figures in that press release, or is he saying that they apply to England and that his pledge, which applies to Wales, is not in line with Government policy relating to England?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not have that press release, but many figures published by the Department of Health show that, in line with the policy of the past 17 years, there will be an increase in all our planned provision for the health service over and above the RPI for the coming year. As I said, the hon. Gentleman can choose whether to believe that—does he think that the provision should be increased over and above the rate of inflation? I take it from what he just said that he thinks that the health service is underfunded. If he thinks so, why does he find it so difficult to answer my question?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0562">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because I do not believe the figures. The document to which I am referring—and of which the Secretary of State is not aware—is the Budget press release from the Department of Health dates 26 November. The figures on page 3 refer to the Department of Health's total spending and to the percentage of real growth, showing the estimated out-turn for the current financial year, 1996–97, an increase of 0.8 per cent. for the next financial year of 1998–98, and a reduction of 0.7 per cent. in the spending plans for 1998–99. I shall give those figures to the Secretary of state and he can pursue the matter. It is because of such misrepresentation that the Government do not have credibility. The Secretary of State is denying the figures of the Department of Health. There is a forecast reduction—what is the right hon. Gentleman's answer to that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hague</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have already made that clear, but the details will be given in the Welsh spending statement next week. I propose to increase money for the health service in the coming year by more that the increase in the retail prices index. I am also giving that commitment for the whole of the next Parliament. All that I am asking is whether the hon. Gentleman can match that. I fail to understand why he cannot say so. If he thinks that the health service is not given the right amount of money, how much more should it be given? If he cannot answer that question, why not just say that a Labour Government would increase spending on the health service by more than the rate of inflation? I have given that promise, so why cannot the Labour party?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point at issue is clear. The Government are deeply rooted in their attempt to deceive the public about their spending intentions. I shall make no comment about the figures.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Gwilym Jones)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman promised a direct answer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not commenting on figures that have been presented deliberately to mislead us. I have asked the Secretary of State a direct question. He has had the opportunity to read the Department of Health press release, so I hope that he can respond. [<i>Interruption.</i>] It is very interesting that some Conservative Members thinks that the Government's deliberate attempt to conceal the truth from the people of Wales and to mislead the Committee about their future spending plans is so humorous. I hope that they will still be laughing after the election, when the people of Wales have had the opportunity to comment on those spending plans.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can give an example in my area to show how much we can trust the Government with the health service. The Dyfed Powys health authority has overspent heavily by £9 million. The Welsh Office has offered a loan of £9 million, which will have to be repaid in cuts in the next three years. Individual trusts that purchase from the health authority are desperately looking for ways to save money. The authority has a loan to keep it going this year, but cuts will be in the pipeline.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Just as in the health service, other services will have deep cuts in their budgets, which will be announced in the coming weeks. The hon. Member for Caernarfon referred to the 30 per cent. cut of £20 million in the budget of Tai Cymru. We know that there will be deep cuts in the budget allocated to the training and enterprise councils in Wales.<br><br>
Having dealth with the Government's spurious claims of having cut tax and increased public expenditure, I shall return to the issue of the public sector borrowing requirement. The Government have no credibility on those matters. Before the previous election, they estimated that PSBR would have fallen in the current year to £6 billion, but it will be £27 billion. That is the sort of forecast that the Government made five years ago. They now expect us to accept a basis of truth in their forecasts for future years. Is it any wonder that we do not believe them when they were £21 billion out in their estimate of PSBR? That is an error of 450 per cent. It is little wonder that the Government have no credibility for their handling of the economy.<br><br>
Last year in the Welsh Grand Committee, the Secretary of State trotted out the Treasury line that PSBR was set to fall to zero. He cannot get his forecasts right, nor can he accept when he is wrong. That figure of £21 billion is three times the whole of the Welsh Office block grant, which I should have thought would be hard for the Government to miss, even with their reputation for dodgy accounting.<br><br>
When we consider the four years of this Parliament, which is what the Welsh people will do when they vote in the not too distant future, we see that PSBR has been underestimated by £46 billion. If we take that and the underestimate for the current year, we have a total underestimate of £67 billion. The Secretary of State expects us to accept at face value his figures when they have been so consistently and dramatically wrong.<br><br>
I do not think, for one moment, that we should trust the Government's forecasts. Their estimates for growth are incredibly high and for expenditure their estimates are unreasonable and unsustainable. No one believes their inflation forecast and, as we have seen, enormous pressure is building up in the financial market, which is already costing jobs in my constituency because of producers' inability to compete externally, given the rising value of the pound.<br><br>
In short, we are dealing with a typically tricky Tory Budget. In 1992, the Government tried to pull a trick which, unfortunately, they got away with temporarily, but the people had to pay the price. The Government are trying to pull that trick again, but they will not get away with it this time. Their day of reckoning is coming. The people are wiser now and this clapped-out, discredited Government will pay the price in the forthcoming general election.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts <span class='memberconstituency'>(Conwy)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: A headline caught my eye last Wednesday in <i>The Guardian:</i>
<br><blockquote><p>"Wales put their faith in Davies".</p></blockquote>
For a moment I thought that the hon. Member for Caerphilly had achieved a breakthrough in credibility, but then I realised that I was looking at the sports pages
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0563">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
and that the reference was to Jonathan Davies, who put up such a creditable performance in Australia on Sunday.<br><br>
Listening to the hon. Member for Caerphilly, I cannot believe that he will achieve credibility. He talked much about it but, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State tried to point out earlier, there was a contradiction running through the hon. Gentleman's speech. Such a contradiction has been running through many speeches by Opposition Front-Bench spokesmen throughout the Budget debate. The contradiction is that they criticise the Government's taxing and borrowing plans and, at the same time, imply—they do not actually say—that spending is inadequate and should be increased. If that is not having one's cake and eating it, I do not know what is.<br><br>
I always know when we have had a good Budget by the vehemence of the Opposition's nit-picking and vituperation. We have certainly heard plenty of that—not so much soundbites as sound snacks and full-blown Sunday dinners.<br><br>
Sooner or later, the Opposition must come clean. In last week's Budget debate, the hon. Member for Caernarfon began pressing on that matter and saying what they would do and how they would raise the money. I was surprised to hear the hon. Member for Caerphilly quoting <i>The Times</i> in his aid. Almost every day when I have picked up <i>The Times,</i> Mr. Peter Riddell has been pressing the Opposition to come clean and tell us how they are going to raise the money.<br><br>
I began to tackle the hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Dr. Strang) on the Floor of the House last night, because the Opposition have said that they will reduce value added tax on fuel to 5 per cent. and we know that that will cost £450 million to £500 million. They are reluctant to spell out how they will make up the shortfall. We have managed to elicit from them that they propose to secure £120 million by abolishing relief for the elderly on private medical insurance and, last night, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, East not only confirmed that, but said that there would be a change in inheritance tax and the corporate tax regime. That means that the price of reducing VAT to 5 per cent. will be the elimination of one relief for the elderly and a double increase in tax.<br><br>
There will be little left for the windfall tax by the time my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor the Exchequer's new army of revenue Atalantas has picked up such golden apples as have escaped collection so far. Long life investment allowances have been cut from 25 per cent. to 6 per cent. per annum. One only has to listen to Opposition Members to know that, under a Labour Government—should we be so unfortunate as to have one—there would be a rash of new taxes and the face of Wales, like the rest of the United Kingdom, would be pitted and scarred by them.<br><br>
Turning to the Budget, of course Welsh people will benefit from the general reductions in taxation, which must be welcomed in a region where average household income and expenditure is as low as it is. We must especially welcome the 1p cut in the basic rate and the extension of the 20 per cent. basic rate band. I certainly
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
believe that people should be allowed to keep more of the money that they earn. The overall position is that stated by the Government—on average, people will be some £20 a week better off.<br><br>
In Wales, a fifth of our population are pensioners and the substantial increase in their personal allowances to £310—that is £200 more than indexation—should certainly warm the hearts of many pensioners in my constituency. The increase in petrol and diesel duty will not be welcome, except by those of green political disposition. There was a Division on that resolution last night and I was surprised to see the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North (Mr. Dafis) in the "No" Lobby. A few moments ago, I noted that he was taking part in the debate on the Floor of the House about sustainable development. I excuse him because he had a somewhat confusing day yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wigley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Having made a stinging personal attack on my hon. Friend the Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Stinging?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wigley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As stinging as the right hon. Member for Conwy can be. May I point out that, to achieve a sustainable set of taxation policies, a broad approach is necessary, not only with regard to fuel in rural areas but with regard to the effect of carbon levels in inner cities? There needs to be a package, including a package for an increase in public transport. One cannot take one item in isolation from that package if one wants a sustainable policy on fuel.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that as a reason for voting against last night's resolution because the resolution was part of the package, as my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer said last night.<br><br>
Of particular importance to businesses in Wales is the reduction in the rates of corporation tax for small companies, which is in line with the basic rate of income tax, as my right hon. Friend said in his opening speech. Also of importance is the simplification of tax relief for training costs, the cut in employers' national insurance, which was announced last year but comes into effect this year and the freeze in business rates for small properties. All those measures taken together, should make life much easier for the bulk of our business community and, in Wales, we are very dependent on thousands of small businesses.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richards</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my right hon. Friend agree that many businesses in his constituency, as in mine, are dependent on the tourist industry? That industry is the basis of the economy in both our constituencies. Those who are employed in that industry will surely welcome the increase in airport tax proposed by right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I dare say that the industry will welcome the increase but I do not understand why Opposition Members, especially those below the Gangway, should attack any of our increases in taxation, such as that to which my hon. Friend referred. I am sure that when Opposition members speak their
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0564">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 29</span>
general attack on the Government will be for not spending enough. They should be obliged to spell out exactly what their tax plans are.<br><br>
I welcome the extra £60 million in hill livestock compensatory allowances. The rate for cows in severely disadvantaged areas will be increased by £50 to £97.50 and in disadvantaged areas by £46 to £69.75. That substantial help will be greatly appreciated by upland farmers who have had a hard time over the past year.<br><br>
I congratulate my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State on securing £6.9 billion in cash terms for Wales next year and on his transparent honesty in giving us the real-terms figures and percentage changes for future years. What I had not realised until he referred to the increase on previous plans was the extent of his success in changing those plans—the figures are on page 107 of the Red Book. It shows increases in the next three years of £20 million, £70 million and £10 million in the Welsh Office budget. I congratulate my right hon. Friend on his achievement. It is clear that Wales's needs have been recognised yet again in the allocation of UK resources. How long that would last under a devolutionary regime is anyone's guess, but nothing could be more uncertain.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the right hon. Gentleman accept that page 124 of the Red Book shows that in real terms—it is in real terms that people spend their money on services—there will be a £100 million cut in public expenditure in Wales from the current financial year to the next financial year? That will have a direct impact on a range of services. Does he accept that, although there has been a cash increase, the ability of services to spend money has been reduced by £100 million?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is referring to the information that my right hon. Friend made public. We must also take account of his other point, which has been shown to be true and accurate in the table on page 107, which shows an increase from previous spending budgets. We are not denying the situation as published by my right hon. Friend—that there will be a change in real terms in the figures, as he has specified.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend has yet to make his allocations to the various areas within his sphere of responsibility. He has already announced his proposals for local government revenue spending next year, which is 2.3 per cent. up on this year, and the increase in simple Government support by 2.6 per cent. All I can say is that those figures compare very favourably with the position in England and Scotland. Again, the table on page 126 of the Red Book shows that that is clearly the case. In particular, I welcome the increase to £169.2 million in the amount devoted to community care which, if my memory serves me right, is considerably more than was allocated in the previous year. The figures give the lie to the claims made by the Opposition that my right hon. Friend would make life impossible for the local authorities and for council tax payers.<br><br>
Of course, we shall have the usual cry from the local authorities that they have not had enough and that there is no room for efficiency savings. I find it very wrong that the hon. Member for Caerphilly and, I dare say, others imply—they do not actually say so—that they
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
would give more to the local authorities. We have to remember, as do the local authorities and taxpayers, that 88 per cent. of local authority spending in Wales is taxpayers' money and is derived from central Government. The Government are entitled to ensure that full value is obtained for it.<br><br>
As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State pointed out so clearly, that proportion of 88 per cent. is considerably greater than the proportion allocated to local authorities in England. I do not presume to advise my right hon. Friend on how he should allocate the rest of his Welsh block but he must give appropriate priority to health. He has already indicated that he will do so and I am astonished that he cannot extract a similar pledge from Opposition Front-Bench Members.<br><br>
I hope that my right hon. Friend will also be able to spend on education and training. We have seen astonishing progress on both fronts over the past 17 years and it is as well to remind the people of Wales that the Conservative Government has never had to make real cuts in the health service, as happened under the last Labour Government in 1977–78 when hospital building, for example, could not proceed properly for lack of funds. I know it only too well because, as a Minister, I had responsibility for the health service when we came into office in 1979 and I had to repair the terrible damage done by those cuts in health service spending. All the troubles that we had at Ysbyty Gwynedd cost us millions to put right and were all treaceable back to those cuts that occurred under the previous Labour Government.<br><br>
That is such a distressing sage that I shall spare the Committee too many further details, but the sort of thing that happened as a result of those cuts was that a shortcut was taken in Ysbyty Gwynedd with a drainage pipe from the pathology laboratory. They sent that pipe over the canteen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was the Minister's fault.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was due to cuts in the hospital building programme at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely the hon. Gentleman realises that W. S. Atkins has actually paid compensation on account of the faults in the construction at Ysbyty Gwynedd. If a construction company or consulting engineers have to had pay compensation surely he realises that it is not direct ministerial responsibility for a pipe being put in wrong between the kitchens and the pathology laboratory at Ysbyty Gwynedd. That really is an utterly absurd claim.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am well aware that compensation was paid because I was the Minister responsible for ensuring that we fought to get that compensation, but there is no doubt in my mind that most of the terrible troubles that we had in Ysbyty Gwynedd, for example, went back to that period when there was a cut in the hospital spending programme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ynys Môn)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can I bring the former Minister up to the end of the 20th century? Last year, the Chancellor announced a building programme of 12 new hospitals. This year, he managed—on the day before the Budget—to announce that just one would be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0565">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
built under the private finance initiative. In addition, the PH programme for Heath hospital has had to be underwritten by the Secretary of State during the past few months.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had an extensive hospital building programme in Wales over the past decade or so. I shall happily run through the new hospitals for the hon. Gentleman—Ysbyty Gwynedd, Ysbyty Glan Clwyd, Wrexham Maelor—[<i>Interruption.</i>] No, that was opened by the former Prime Minister, now Baroness Thatcher—[<i>Interruption.</i>] Planning began as long ago as 1966, but the money was not forthcoming and the idea began to disappear, trickling to nothing after cuts were imposed by the last Labour Government. Many of the defects that we have had to put right at Ysbyty Gwynedd were directly attributable to those cuts.<br><br>
Moves are afoot to secure PFI funding for the Cardiff proposal. I was glad to hear my right hon. Friend say that the Budget settlement would build on the many successes of recent years and, in particular, help to develop the Welsh economy. That development is the key to prosperity in Wales.<br><br>
A fifth of our population are pensioners. More than a fifth of household incomes in Wales in 1994–95 came from social security benefits, a proportion higher than in any other region. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security told us, in a letter on Budget day, that social security costs every working person £15 every working day. We spend £4 billion on the administration of benefits. It is in all our interests to get those costs down as far as possible, but not by the highhanded and draconian means proposed by the Benefits Agency in Wales, which would deny people their legitimate rights. I am sure that my right hon. Friend will have noted the concern expressed in the House last Wednesday and the month's extension to the consultation period.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The right hon. Gentleman has been on his feet for almost 25 minutes. This is a very short debate and I should be glad if he would bring his remarks to a close.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Hughes, but there has been a considerable number of interruptions.<br><br>
I referred earlier to "Regional Trends", which reveals that Wales was the only region in which the proportion of male employees in manufacturing was higher in 1995 than 1981. The Government are working on the right lines in seeking to attract inward investment and to develop indigenous businesses to provide more and better employment. I am delighted that the Government are achieving success.<br><br>
I was pleased to hear my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State say on Monday that Wales has recorded 128 projects so far this year, promising 13,600 jobs and £2.4 billion of investment. I was also delighted to hear today's announcement. More than 75,000 jobs in Wales are the result of inward investment over the years. Those jobs depend on our continued access to the European market. The challenge is to ensure the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
perpetuation of that access at the least possible political price. We must try also to increase our share of world trade and our participation in the fast-growing Asian market.<br><br>
Thanks to the Government, our economic circumstances are promising. I hope that the Labour party is not given the chance to take Wales's eye off its economic goals and on to the costly devolution shenanigans with which it is obsessed, which will ruin the prospects of growth in jobs and prosperity.</span></p>
<p>12.21 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Don Touhig <span class='memberconstituency'>(Islwyn)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to take part in the debate. I was elected to the House in a by-election last year. The Conservative candidate polled only 3.9 per cent. of the vote and lost his deposit. If another by-election were to be held in Islwyn today, the Budget would not change that result.<br><br>
The Budget will do little to help the people of Islwyn. The Government announced a 1 p reduction in the basic rate of income tax, but that is no compensation for the tax increases that the Government have imposed on the people of Wales since 1992, nor does it make amends for the lack of investment in Wales's future. People know that they will be worse off under the Tories. They know that what is given to them today will be taken away tomorrow.<br><br>
My constituents—you know them well, Mr. Hughes—are the most generous-natured people, yet even they will be staggered by last night's comments of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, which were repeated here this morning. He said in the House last night that it was the Government's assertion
<br><blockquote><p>"that the average family is £20 a week better off, after all tax changes both up and down over the past four years, and after intlation."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 3 December 1996; Vol. 286, c. 898.]</p></blockquote>
When I return to Islwyn tomorrow, I intend to seek out Mr. and Mrs. Average to give them that good news.<br><br>
The Chancellor yesterday and Ministers this morning have said nothing about the downside of the Budget—about the extra tax on cars and petrol, the increase in prescription charges or the insurance and airport taxes. Indeed, the only figures not to have increased is the Tory party's poll rating.<br><br>
The biggest blow to my constituency will be the inevitable rise in council tax. Islwyn, served by the new Caerphilly county borough council, last year saw its council tax rise by 25 per cent. Had it not been for the dampening grant, that increase might have been 68 per cent. Because of the Government's insistence on playing petty politics with the nation's resources, the people of Islwyn now face another rise in council tax. People will know that the Government, not the local council, are responsible for that. Caerphilly county borough council estimates that, unless a further dampening grant is made, the council tax will rise by 25 per cent. or more. Despite that, the council will probably have to make cuts of between £8 million and £10 million.<br><br>
Far from supporting people, the Budget puts in jeopardy the very services that people depend on in their everyday lives. Those local government services are essential to everybody in my constituency and throughout Wales. The schools where our children are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0566">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 33</span>
educated, the leisure centres where we learn to swim and take exercise, and the pavements that we walk on are all at risk as a result of the Budget. Instead of being supported, local government services will be squeezed by the settlement to be announced next week.<br><br>
The Government would rather see quangos running Wales than democratically elected councillors. Those non-accountable, non-elected and non-representative quangos run everything in Wales—from health to further education, from the Housing Corporation to the arts. They all meet behind closed doors; few people in Wales know who sits on the boards. The top 10 quangos in Wales now have administrative costs of more than £51 million.<br><br>
The Government have created and cherished quangos such as the south and east Wales ambulance trust, which brough in consultants at an original cost of £9,900 to reduce operational costs, but ended up spending £350,000—the trust is now forecast to have a huge deficit of more than £800,000. Given the recent auditor's report on the trust and the fact that the Select Committee on Wales recently met and expressed its confidence in the trust's chairman and chief executive, I am staggered at the Welsh Office's inactivity over the trust's non-executive directors.<br><br>
Welsh Office Ministers are lucky that they are running only a Government Department. If they were running a real business in the real commercial world, where people such as those who run the ambulance trust would be bankrupt, they would never get their proposals past their board of directors. That same quango, which organised a farcical day trip to the hypermarket in Dunkirk—the hypermarket was closed that day, by the way—cannot guarantee that there will be an ambulance for my constituents when they need one in a hurry.<br><br>
The Government prefer quangos, such as the Gwent health commission, to run health. That commission, to our shame, was the only one in Britain that decided to market test the care of the terminally ill—that is sick in the mind, and should never have happened.<br><br>
We all know why the Government are so enthusiastic about quangos: they provide jobs for the boys. I am interested in jobs for the boys and girls of the constituency that I represent. Where in the Budget are the plans for investment in their future? The unemployment rate in Wales, especially for men, is still higher than the United Kingdom average. Yesterday, my hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly, the shadow Secretary of State, other hon. Members representing the Welsh valleys and I met members of the Heads of the Valleys standing conference, who told us that male unemployment in the borough of Caerphilly, which includes my constituency, stands at a level of 18.6 per cent.—almost one in five.<br><br>
Young men and women leaving school or college face an uncertain future. They need job opportunities, not a job seekers allowance. They need training and guidance. We need to invest in them; in doing so, we invest in our future. What has the Budget done? It proposes to reduce the grants that fund the training councils by £34 million. It proposes cutting university capital spending by a further £20 million. Those steps will not create jobs for our young people, nor will they
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
enable them to train in the skills that they will need to work in the modem age.<br><br>
Those who have spent all their lives in work are no better off as a result of the Budget; I am thinking of the pensioners whom I represent. In one area of my constituency, in the village of Cross Keys, almost 25 per cent. of the population are pensioners who live on their own; there is nothing in the Budget for them. The 1 p cut in income tax will make no difference to them, but increases in the taxes that they must pay, such as value added tax on fuel—which the Government promised never to increase—make a big impact on their budgets.<br><br>
Pensioners are forced to wait for financial aid when there is severely cold weather. After seven consecutive days when the average air temperature is at or below freezing point, they receive £8.50 per day. Last year, pensioners in the village of Markham in my constituency were without electricity supplies and heat for almost two weeks, but we had a devil or a battle to secure compensation for them. There is no provision in the Budget for immediate action to help pensioners on that issue. The Committee well knows that, in 1995–96, 46,000 more elderly people died in winter than died in summer. Such people will be at risk during the coming winter. The Budget might keep whisky drinkers warm, but it certainly will not help the pensioners whom I represent. Whether pensioner or school child, single parent or young working man or woman, the Budget will do nothing to help the people of my constituency, the people of Wales or the Tory party, which will be swept from office at the general election.</span></p>
<p>12.29 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alex Carlile <span class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomery)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: By the law of averages, this is likely to be the last sitting of the Welsh Grand Committee that I shall have the opportunity to address before my retirement from Parliament. I cannot pretend to have been here even a decent fraction of the time that the right hon. Member for Conwy (Sir W. Roberts) has been attending the Committee's sittings but, nevertheless, it has been an interesting experience.<br><br>
I doubt that when I muse on my experiences of the Committee in future years I shall be reflecting on the Committee that has made the greatest contribution to the government of Wales of all the bodies connected with Wales. Speaking personally, I would rather that this political talking shop were replaced by a political workshop, but at least the Committee provides opportunities—they have been rather infrequent recently—to enjoy debates on issues of concern to Wales.<br><br>
In my time in the House—I was elected in 1983—there have, regrettably, been only Conservative Governments, so there has been a sense of déjà vu about Welsh Grand Committee debates on the Budget. In 1983, hon. Members were speaking of the diminution of the largely successful Welsh education system under a Tory Government who had been in power for only four years—we are still talking about that today. In 1983, hon. Members were speaking of the reduction of provision in other public services such as the police, fire and health services—we speak of the same today. I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0567">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 35</span>
shall deal with the south-east Wales ambulance trust later.<br><br>
In 1983, hon. Members spoke of the agricultural industry being in crisis. Despite the welcome increase to hill livestock compensatory allowances, we speak of the same today. In 1983, hon. Members were speaking of difficulties in sparking off indigenous Welsh industry, and we do so today. We should not forget that difficulty as we welcome incoming industries, especially those coming from abroad.<br><br>
I shall briefly highlight four matters which the Budget has failed to address—a disappointment compounded by the fact that previous Budgets have failed us in similar ways. I shall first deal with the nursery voucher system which has been provided for in the Budget. Most people in Wales, especially those involved with nursery and primary education, can describe the nursery voucher system in a single phrase: "a complete waste of money". Almost no one in Wales sees any need for that system. Indeed, it promises to reduce nursery provision in areas such as Powys and many other parts of rural Wales where children under the age of five already receive nursery education.<br><br>
Secondly, there is the question of what is happening in secondary schools. Of course, the national curriculum has some advantages, but it has also had the effect of stultifying the talent and diversity of teachers and the schools in which they work. Wales has never had a standardised system of education in which every school does the same, but we have now been forced to adopt one. I believe that the imagination and diversity that schools used to offer is disappearing, to the great frustration of those who run schools.<br><br>
There is a crisis in higher education. Of course, the Government's recent decision to reduce their proposed cut in higher education funding from 3 per cent. to 0.5 per cent. should be welcomed. However, that is happening against the background of universities and colleges having to take on hugely increased student numbers. They are finding it extremely difficult to sustain standards.<br><br>
One should ask employers, as I have, what they make of first-degree graduates who join their companies and organisations. On the whole, although there are honourable exceptions, they find that they are getting worse quality graduates than they were 10 years ago and that young graduates are learning much less at universities. The evidence as to the cause seems clear—there is less time for each student to be tutored in universities these days. That cannot be to the advantage of students or the British economy into which they enter once they have their degree.<br><br>
On public service and infrastructure, the evidence from the Red Book is clear. Table 5A.7 on page 126 shows that there has been a year-on-year real terms cut in the provision of public services in Wales, and that will continue. One can see evidence of that wherever one looks, such as the roads budget in Powys. The maintenance of rural roads that service our largest industry—agriculture—is being reduced. Powys county council must find £6 million-worth of cuts and the roads will be the first to suffer.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
The trunk roads budget in Wales has also been affected. Roads from the English border to the area where the Development Board for Rural Wales has done so well in increasing factories and employment will not be improved because of cuts. That does not encourage more industrial development in rural mid Wales.<br><br>
Furthermore, the quality of some of the trunk roads is not high. The Under-Secretary of State for Wales was kind enough yesterday to accept a petition from my local newspaper, the <i>County Times</i> & <i>Express,</i> relating to an extremely dangerous road junction that the Welsh Office constructed at Sarnybryncaled near Welshpool. That is, I am afraid, a junction of death at which there have been fatalities and serious injuries. I am sure that the Welsh Office will in due course make the right decision and provide a roundabout there. That should have been done at the beginning, but it failed to heed warnings.<br><br>
Health is also part of the public service infrastructure. The hon. Member of Islwyn (Mr. Touhig) mentioned the unsatisfactory performance of the south and east Wales ambulance trust. The evidence that I will cite is its introduction of the astonishing concept of the one-man ambulance. On at least 42 shifts in my constituency, one-man ambulances have been in operation. If an elderly person living alone in a remote country cottage has a heart attack and a one-man ambulance turns up, one shudders to think who will carry the other end of the stretcher. That concept is mindbogglingly unacceptable and should not occur.<br><br>
The Welsh Office, which now has partial responsibility for funding the police service in Wales, has failed to deal with the pensions timebomb that has already exploded in all Welsh police forces and the fire service in Wales. A system whereby small police forces and fire services have to pay pensions out of revenue inevitably means that the quality of service cannot be sustained.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Caernarfon mentioned housing. We have only to look at our constituency surgeries to see how, under this Government, Budget after Budget has failed to provide the houses that are needed. When I first became a Member of Parliament, there was no difficulty in a local, deserving young couple getting married and finding a good quality council house. The story is totally different nowadays and alternative provision has not been made.<br><br>
As well as roads, which I have already mentioned, the transport infrastucture is a scene of great disappointment. When the right hon. Member for Wokingham was Secretary of State for Wales he sensibly promised that he would try to take measures to encourage freight on to the railways passing through rural Wales. There is still no freight on the Shrewsbury to Aberystwyth line. Why is not the carriage of freight on the railways part of the Government's transport strategy?<br><br>
I want to say a word about agriculture. Obviously, the BSE crisis has shattered the confidence of the industry in Wales. I shall not enter into the details of the debate as to whether the Government have managed the crisis well or badly. The farmers think that they have managed it badly and perhaps the perception is at least
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0568">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 37</span>
as important as the reality. Farmers lack confidence in the long-term future of their industry. Let us not forget that despite industry coming into Wales and the welcome that we rightly give it, our larget industry—by a great distance—is agriculture. It always has been and is likely to remain so for decades, if not centuries.<br><br>
Welsh Office Ministers have not had sufficient input into the common agricultural policy, particularly its reform. I have observed, lived among, spoken to and represented farmers for many years and their view is that the current structures of the CAP no longer meet the management needs of farming. They budget if not month to month then year to year. Major reform of the CAP embracing environmental considerations and including consideration of infrastructure policy could lead to planning in three-year cycles. The countryside could be managed more sustainably and food production maintained at at appropriate level.<br><br>
I come now to industry. I have said twice that we should welcome inward investment. It is regrettable that another—perhaps the other—good idea of the right hon. Member for Wokingham when he was Secretary of State, apart from putting more freight on the railways, has not come to fruition. He told this Committee of his intention to create a venture capital industry, which would have a Welsh focus and enable indigenous industry to grow. That is not happening. There is still no venture capital industry worth the name in Wales. That industry is the way in which pump priming of ideas takes place, turning small ideas into big businesses. It may be the manufacture of a vital widget or of something like Two Dogs alcoholic lemonade, which we heard this morning had been sold for a large sum three years after it was invented in a back garden somewhere in the Antipodes. Ideas cannot be turned into big industry without a venture capital industry. I would encourage the Welsh Office, whatever party was running it, to consider that important issue.<br><br>
I hope that the structures for economic development will continue to focus specifically on rural Wales, separately from the rest of Wales. The name of the structures is less important than the performance, but I urge the Labour party particularly—it is slightly suspect in its intentions towards the Development Board for Rural Wales—to support at least a strong separate identity for economic regeneration in rural Wales.<br><br>
I make a plea: the DBRW and the Welsh Development Agency should study indigenous business and commerce specifically. There is a legend in Newtown in my constituenncy called Cheap Charlie's. The shop began as a market stall selling old hammers and old screwdrivers and is now Charlie's Stores Ltd. It is run by Mr. Chris Lloyd and has three department stores in Wales and the borders. Turnover exceeds £10 million. Charlie's Stores Ltd. is built entirely on local initiative and pays well above the rates of most incoming industries. It has getting on for 100 loyal employees and has become even more of a legend in mid Wales. Charlie's Stores Ltd.—we still call it Cheap Charlie's in Montgomeryshire—wants a new distribution warehouse in Newtown. But will the Development Board for Rural Wales assist the firm in that? No, because Charlie's Stores Ltd. does not fall
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 38</span>
within the classic statutory mould for DBRW assistance.<br><br>
The DBRW will help a company from across the world that employs 12 people to find a new building for its business, but it will not help Charlie's Stores Ltd. to develop, even though that business has a vast and expanding turnover and commands great local respect. I have written to David Rowe-Beddoe about the matter, and I urge the Secretary of State to look into it, in both particular and general terms.<br><br>
Wales has a good story to tell for the future. Early next year, I shall retire from the House and run my professional business from my home in rural mid Wales. Wales is a wonderful place to live: people's understanding of politics finds out most of us at some time during our political careers, and it is combined with a sophisticated comprehension of the philosophies and beliefs of political parties. That is probably founded on the great traditions of church and chapel—and the concomitant disputations—and on a great educational tradition.<br><br>
I believe that Wales fears that its performance in recent years has rendered it less relevant as a specific and separate part of the United Kingdom. Wales has been offended—rightly—by the fact that the past five Secretaries of State have represented English constituencies.<br><br>
Less than 100 years ago a person appointed to the Cabinet would be required to fight a by-election in his constituency. It might be a good idea to establish a convention that, on appointment, an English Secretary of State for Wales would have to fight a by-election in a Welsh constituency. That would mean that even a brilliant young man from a distant northern part would acquire some real Welsh credentials before taking up his post.<br><br>
I hope that, when other hon. Members discuss future Budgets, Wales will be more democratic. I hope that it will be a thriving country, where political life remains lively but a little more constructive than in recent years.</span></p>
<p>12.48 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ynys Môn)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: That might well have been the swan song in this Committee of the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Carlile), but he has given us an opportunity to examine some of the important issues affecting Wales under this Government. He has also shown how we might improve our performance in the future.<br><br>
I listened carefully to the Secretary of State's analysis of the Budget. Clearly, he was optimistic and wanted to put the best gloss on things, so he told us about the Welsh Office budget, increased health spending and the 1p cut in income tax. However, he did not tell the Committee about the Chancellor's underlying assumptions, which are extremely optimistic about the three key criteria of inflation, growth and the public sector borrowing requirement.<br><br>
The Chancellor said that inflation will hit its target of under 2.5 per cent. by the end of 1997, and his public expenditure plans are predicated on that. He said that he expects the growth rate to be 3.5 per cent. next year and the PSBR to be in balance by the end of the century. He
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0569">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 39</span>
did not, however, tell us that the Bank of England does not share his inflation target, nor that its November 1996 report on inflation clearly said that he would not meet it. If he fails to meet his target but still bases his public expenditure plans on it, there will be another shortfall by the end of 1997.<br><br>
It is important for the Chancellor to achieve his 3.5 per cent. growth rate because his tax take depends on it. If growth is less than 3.5 per cent.—most commentators believe that it will be 3 or 3.25 per cent.—the tax take will be lower than the Chancellor has predicted.<br><br>
The Chancellor told us that he expected the PSBR to balance by the end of the century. He told us something different last year, however, when he expected it to balance a few years before that. The Government's borrowing has clearly increased dramatically and, although they talk of getting into balance in the medium term, that is clearly a moving target, which constantly moves away from us.<br><br>
Against the background of those optimistic targets, the Chancellor told us that the Budget was responsible and that he could, for example, afford to cut income tax by 1p in the pound. His problem is, however, that if he misses any of his targets by a substantial amount, he will leave his successor—and we are talking about a successor—with a worsening position in terms of tax take, inflation and interest rates.<br><br>
We already know what building societies have made of the Budget—they believe that there will be another increase in interest rates. That is why the Abbey National and other building societies said that they were putting up their interest rates the day after the Budget. The average Abbey National borrower is now worse off than before the Budget because the 0.25 per cent. increase in interest rates wipes out the 1p cut in income tax. The Chancellor will be under pressure from the Bank of England to increase rates further before the end of the year. It has, therefore, been predicted that interest rate increases will have wiped out the benefits of the Chancellor's income tax cut by the election.<br><br>
This is an irresponsible tax-cutting Budget for the election. The first Chancellor to introduce a Budget in the next Parliament will have to put up interest rates on two fronts because the current Chancellor will not meet his optimistic targets and borrowing requirements will be substantially higher than he predicted.<br><br>
That is the background against which Wales should examine the Budget. We have listened carefully to the Secretary of State's comments about the Welsh Office budget, and I shall return to that subject. I want to deal first, however, with the 1p income tax cut, which is extremely badly targeted. The right hon. Member for Conwy told us that it would help people in Wales because they are generally on low incomes. The reality is, however, that it will help not them, but only people with higher earnings because people on low pay now spend more of their income on income tax than at any time since the war.<br><br>
In 1972, the value of the personal allowance was 30 per cent. of average earnings, but it is now 19 per cent. People on low incomes pay more income tax under the Tories than ever before. That is why Plaid
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 40</span>
Cymru has called for a substantial increase in personal allowances to lift many more people out of income tax. I appreciate that the Chancellor increased the allowance by more than indexation, but had he increased it by a little more, 50,000 low earners in Wales would not pay any income tax. Moreover, had he lifted the old-age allowance, 20,000 more pensioners in Wales would be paying no tax at all.<br><br>
The help that was available under the Budget should have been targeted at the low paid. The right hon. Member for Conwy was absolutely right when he said that Wales was a country of low pay with many people dependent on state benefit. The best way to get people off state benefits and into work is to give them an incentive to get into work and ensure that a large proportion of their income will not be taken in tax.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Wyn Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must acknowledge that I also mentioned the extension of the 20p rate. Surely that should be helpful to many people who are on low wages in Wales.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that as a basic principle, but our plans would have taken people out of tax altogether. It is important to remember that in 1972, a substantial proportion of people in Wales did not pay tax at all. Since 1972—in the main, a period of Conservative Government—people on low pay have paid more of their income in tax. The Government tell us that they are enabling people to have more money in their pockets, but the low paid in Wales do not have more money in their pockets under the Conservative Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richards</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, time is moving on. The hon. Gentleman will have an opportunity to speak in due course.<br><br>
It is vital for the Government to recognize—as the Secretary of State did—that there are areas of high unemployment in Wales. The success of inward investment has been very localized—many more jobs need to be created all over Wales. Vast parts of rural Wales contain major pockets of structural, long-term unemployment. That is why our Budget proposals suggested the creation of a £360 million fund which could be used to get people back to work under our plans for 100,000 answers, which represents the number of people who are out of work in Wales. We would have paid for that by raising the ceiling on employees' national insurance contributions.<br><br>
If one has a spending plan, it must be costed and people must be told what it would mean. That is what we are doing this morning. In addition to not cutting income tax last year and this year—we voted against income tax rises both times—we would have used the money to get people back to work in Wales.<br><br>
Finally, the Secretary of State has tried to tell us that the Welsh Office budget looks better this year than it did last year. He said that he had secured more in terms of the base figure than he had in the previous year. The reality, which the Secretary of State must accept, is that Welsh councils will have less money next year than they had this year and less money the following year
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0570">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 41</span>
than they will get next year. The Budget will make increasing cuts in real terms.<br><br>
The Secretary of State tells Welsh councils that because he has secured extra money, they should not put up their council tax. What will happen to their services? Local authorities have had year-on-year cuts in real terms for several years. Some have cut their administration costs substantially; what are they to do next? He tells them that they should not increase their council tax, so the alternative must be to cut services.<br><br>
It is clear that Welsh local authorities will face cuts in services as well as increases in council tax. That is the problem that they will face in this final year of Conservative Administration. It will mean that our education services, our social services and our roads
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 42</span>
spending programmes will all be cut. The Secretary of State should come clean with local authorities. He should admit that he has been unable to give them a real-terms increase and that they will therefore have to cut their services or put up council tax, or both. Local authorities will say that he is forcing them to do both.<br><br>
As a result of the Budget, the people of Wales will have an additional reason to reject the Tories at the next election.</span></p>
